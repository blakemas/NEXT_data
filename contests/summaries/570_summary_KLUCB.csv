1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"You know Hal, I think that pheromone cologne you bought is for the birds."
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,That's quite the magic trick!
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,Chick magnet.

1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"You've gone to seed, Herb."
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,This cook book has a good recipe for pigeon pie.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,They're just looking for seed money.
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,"Of course, if they get desperate, they'll eat any old thing"

1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Of course, everyone gets the title’s metaphor but they underestimate To Kill a Mockingbird’s literal potential."
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,"Mr. Hitchcock, so nice to meet you!"
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"Well, I assumed it was because no one else voted for the bird sanctuary."
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I thought flocking was for Christmas trees.
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,I heard it's good luck if one poops on you.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,What will it take to get you to stop tweeting?
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"A bird in the hand, is better than 75 eating you."
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,That's what you get for wearing a hemp seed jacket.
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,I was not aware you could receive your tweets hard copy.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"So, Harry, what else is new?"
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,You know I have you pigeonholed as a bird lover.
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,Go flock yourself.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,Do you mind? I'm trying to read.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,At $1.99 I think that bird whistle was a steal.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,It says they're Cedar Waxwings.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"As I believe I noted before we left home, Eau de Croissant was not the ideal perfume choice."
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,I SO wish that would would happen whenever HE tweets...
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,That’s not how you get your wings.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I'd say your patent pending your bird whistle is a good idea.
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,"Dammit, I'm trying read here!"
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,At least they're not bats.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,Interesting variation on the whole chia pet thing.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,Watcha readin'?
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,So stop talking pigeon English!
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,I expect that will be your last dumb-ass tweet.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Kinda poetic, Alfred, don't you think ?"
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,What's all the flap about?
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I closed my twitter account.
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,They don't take to everybody.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,You been sleeping in that silo again?
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I haven't seen this many tweets since Donald Trump's first week as President.

1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Having run out of bushes to hide in, Sean Spicer gets creative."
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,That's why I stopped doing bird calls.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I'm trying to read.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,How is your pheromone therapy going?
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,They like you.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,Percy's 'chick magnet' scheme went horribly awry.
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,I use the guy at 72nd Street who will brush the crumbs off you for a dollar.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I tweeted you were Trump.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"You are alive, aren't you?"
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,You've finally gone to seed.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,I think your endless tweeting has gone too far.
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,"So, how's that taco?"
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"Song of six pence, or pocket full of rye?"
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"Well, you'd have time for books too if you gave up your Twitter feed."
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,So what's this new tick control you were telling me about?
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,Jesus. Now what's he tweeting?
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,"Well, apart from the sesame seeds, how did you enjoy your bagel?"
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,Your twitter account has a lot of followers.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,You're not supposed to feed the birds.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,That's why they're called lovebirds!
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,The recipe calls for 100 park pigeons. I only count 50.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,At least you are not pigeon toed.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,That happened to me when I was reading ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Yes, that's worth more than two in the bush."
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,I think they have a message for you.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,So statuesque!
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,How is that nut and berry diet working?
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,And what makes you such a big flocking deal?
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,I think you're taking this Hitchcock thing a bit too far.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I'm not sure playing dead is the way to go here.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,Have you considered meeting your friend inside?

1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"What's that, like 50 in the bush?"
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,"No, no - I said his name is Saeed."
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,That must have been a controversial tweet
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Sure Tippi, I'd recognize you anywhere!"
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Now that you mention it, I am feeling a little peckish."
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"So, how's the new job at the fish market working out?"
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,Does this mean you have a pre-existing condition?
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"They might not be stool pigeons, but they'll still blow your cover."
1329,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,570,You really need to stop hanging around those seedy nightclubs.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,I TOLD you not to use peanut-butter based sun block!
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,You're obviously at the top of the pecking order.
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,You must give me the name of your dry cleaners
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,Do not feed the birds.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Yes, I can recommend a good dry cleaner. Why?"
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,Did you change your after shave?
1329,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,570,"Sean, Sean Spicer, is that you?"
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Excuse me, ma'am. Is that Comme des Garcons you're wearing with those sensible black shoes?"
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"You certainly have a way with birds, Mr. Hitchcock."
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,Gesundheit.
1329,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,570,"Yes, that is a very impressive bird call!"
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,I saw a bag of bird seeds. My ex-wife was coming this way. What else should I have done?
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,So you're a bird whisper?
1329,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,570,"One is a symbol of peace, many of war."

1471,0,9,42,51,1.1764705882352942,0.05391265523477457,570,There's this thing called a bird feeder.
1471,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,570,I said: IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONCENTRATE WITH ALL THE CHIRPING!

1471,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,570,This is why I'm not on Twitter.
1471,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,570,I guess you really are going to seed.
