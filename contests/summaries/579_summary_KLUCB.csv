824,5,12,64,81,1.271604938271605,0.06337314947017579,579,You're right. We'd suck at raising kids.
824,3,16,62,81,1.271604938271605,0.05829984668206219,579,Can't you just try canned tuna?

824,6,10,65,81,1.271604938271605,0.06576319676747688,579,"We know this will come as a disappointment, but 'Princess' is just a name."
824,4,14,63,81,1.271604938271605,0.060889359484729344,579,"So, can we assume you prefer being an indoor cat?"
824,4,14,63,81,1.271604938271605,0.060889359484729344,579,You're just not merry enough to play Old King Cole.
824,4,14,63,81,1.271604938271605,0.060889359484729344,579,He wears indolence well don't you think?

2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Sire, is there not one royal feather toy worth holding onto?"
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Well, aren't you the cutest little tyrant."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Yes, even the king has to use the litter box."
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,He won't eat unless I address him as 'sire.'
2035,5,1,50,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07820902253536301,579,The other cats ignored you?
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Look, we understand how to you our one bedroom apartment may seem like a castle."
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"Some bad news, Caesar. Seth is leaving and I'm trading you in for a gecko."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Now that we've got this settled, where do we stand on that hamster I've been wanting?"
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,We want to discuss your attitude.

2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"OK, your meow-jesty."
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,"His analyst suggests we try more groveling, less pampering."
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,The cat in the hat sat for a chat
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,We weren't talking about actually getting a dog.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,The King of the Beasts needs his litter box changed.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Ohh, poor little kitty. You must be so tired after that long phone call with the president of Mexico."
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,This is no ordinary lethargy. Only yesterday he was singing Cole Porter.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,Don't worry; Game of Thrones may still have an Andrew Lloyd Webber finale.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,He's torn between 'CATS' and 'Lion King'
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,I just can't ignore the cat in the room.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,Well the weather forecast did say it's reigning cats and dogs.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,"Don't give up on us Boswell, we're trying hard to find you the right food."
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,Can you imagine if he were an outdoor cat?
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Your ""King of the Jungle"" needs to diet."
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,Think she was one of the pussies grabbed by Trump?
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,We thought you knew king was just your name
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,Can you please go catch him a mouse?
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"""It's Daddy's turn to be the King""."
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,We serve at his pleasure but there's no pleasing him
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,"Blame the media all you want, but they're the ones who made you a fat cat in the first place."
2035,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,579,Of course she's upset. She just ate all of her heirs.
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,"No, it can’t always be ‘spur of the moment,’ but we’ll be your opposable thumbs—we’ll tweet for you."
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"At our request, parliament also adopted a no kitties on the counter rule."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,He had the computer mouse for dinner.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,Not my King!
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,The emperor prefers no clothes.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,He was thin and shy until his video went viral.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"Darling, do you think Puss is getting too big for her own boots ?"
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"Your Majesty, the mice are rebelling and we are running out of tuna. What do you wish us to do?"
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"The White House is nice, Your Majesty. When can we go to Meow A Lago?"
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,We're out of mice. Will robins do?
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,We told you it was going to be hard being king.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,But the residuals from his kitten videos keep coming in.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,Maybe if we elevated the throne?
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,...and that's the reason you haven't produced an heir.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,How could anyone not be a cat person?
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,I thought we agreed we were just getting him neutered
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,Pussy says you grabbed her.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,It's a House cat.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,We both sincerely apologize for calling you a royal pain.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,I don't think he realized that being royal would be so exhausting.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,Never in a million years did I think I'd end up as a cat counseling major.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,He's finally dressing the part!
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,How do we break it to him that he is a co-equal third branch of this family?
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,Think of it as the heirball to the throne.
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,"When he gets to know you, you can crawl forward - slowly - with head bowed."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"So nobody ever told you about the French Revolution, your Highness?"
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,Your meow is my demand.
2035,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,579,I'm not pussy whipped.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,We see you've mastered the Feline Recline.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,He hasn't been the same since we let him watch Lion King.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,I'm sorry King Fluffy. When I called you 'Princess' I meant it as a term of endearment.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,I told you not to start feeding him Fancy Feast.
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,"Puss in Boots is one thing, but wearing a crown, draped in a cloak and lounging on a throne is quite another. What were you thinking of? A subject for Jeff Koons?"
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,She's been like this ever since I told her that 'Queen for a Day' went off the air years ago.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,"OK, more foie gras and deli turkey it will be then."
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,"He says, ""Now is the winter of our discontent. Rub my tummy."""
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Sorry, sire. You've executed the last of the dogs."
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,It's good to be the cat
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,Get over it - you'll have eight more abdications.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,The vet thinks we spoil him.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Um, how many lives do you have left?"
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,We should have stopped when you were president.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"What do you mean we're just ""fake news""?"
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,You're not fat and lazy. That's fake mews.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,Do you think his diet is too rich?
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,We got rid of the dog. Can't we keep the kids?
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"So Fritz, today we'd like to talk to you about empty nest syndrome."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,I thought he'd be happy once we got rid of the dog.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,I'm afraid that naming him 'Donald' was a big mistake.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,He lives the puuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfect life.
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,His ascension was so sudden. I had no idea Queenie was on her last life.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,It all started when we bought him that iPad.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"Ah,don't fret, you'll always be king in our jungle."
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,"Leo, we just know you're going to love having a little human baby brother."
2035,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,579,"Sorry, but no more Fancy Feast. We're putting you back on Meow Mix."
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,YOU wanted to name him Louis.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,"But honey, I'm sure your real mother loves you just as much as we do."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,I told you he was a British Shorthair
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,"Noble, yes, but lazy."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,Isn't he taking this Ser Pounce thing a bit far?
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,Canned or raw?
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,We need to talk about you laissez-faire approach to the litter box.
2035,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,579,She's completely conquered us and now she's bored.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,"No, David, the lawyers were adamant, under Aunt Agatha's will Queenie owns everything."
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,He is probably thinking this place is a dump.
2035,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,579,Maybe a seatbelt would help.
2035,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,579,We're here to serve you. We get it.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,We should have gone with the dog jester
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,This isn't what we meant when we asked you to 'go medieval' on the mice.
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,How exhausting it must be to preside over an entire kingdom that's aloof.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,This all started when you insisted on that damn organic catnip from the farmer's market.
2035,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,579,A dog? This will be the downfall of the Persian Empire!
2035,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,579,It looks like his princely duties are taking a toll.
