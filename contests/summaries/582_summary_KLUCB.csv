327,7,8,56,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07662800286611518,582,Isn’t it great to be able to spend time together?
327,8,6,57,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07921026013194808,582,I'm just saying you're undermining the spirit of the restraining order
327,4,14,53,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06829793087996713,582,It was on sale at Costco
327,8,6,57,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07921026013194808,582,'Wrong number'
327,5,12,54,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07118301657984366,582,I love that we're doing things together.
327,6,10,55,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07395563762369861,582,Catch up! It says you're out of my service area.
327,6,10,55,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07395563762369861,582,I think we should move in together.
327,3,16,52,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06528547216313318,582,"Isn't it great to finally spend some time together, honey?"
327,5,12,54,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07118301657984366,582,Text me when you get there.
327,5,12,54,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07118301657984366,582,Pay attention. It's a long distance call.
327,6,10,55,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07395563762369861,582,...and don't forget we've got couples' therapy at 6:30.
327,6,10,55,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07395563762369861,582,"Well, Charlene, maybe YOU should have taken a closer look at the Groupon!"
327,6,10,55,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07395563762369861,582,We're currently in both first and last place.
327,4,14,53,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06829793087996713,582,Finally...a moment to ourselves.
327,3,16,52,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06528547216313318,582,Please stop BEFORE the train tracks.
327,4,14,53,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06829793087996713,582,"You stretch everything when you're a Trump, Barron. Get used to it."
327,5,12,54,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07118301657984366,582,Follow me.
327,2,18,51,71,1.3098591549295775,0.0621271147619275,582,"You walk the dog, you'll be home before I am."
327,6,10,55,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07395563762369861,582,Last one there buys lunch.
327,3,16,52,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06528547216313318,582,Uh-oh—I forgot about the traffic circle.
327,4,14,53,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06829793087996713,582,It most certainly was green when I crossed!
327,7,8,56,71,1.3098591549295775,0.07662800286611518,582,I'll text you if I see a bump.
327,4,14,53,71,1.3098591549295775,0.06829793087996713,582,"I can't talk now, I'm going into a tunnel."
354,4,13,52,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06941586695932576,582,"I view this as a trial separation, not the end of the road."
354,5,11,53,69,1.3043478260869565,0.07242112982562723,582,Ok I'm done. Call me when you get here.
354,4,13,52,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06941586695932576,582,Daisy? Is that you?
354,4,13,52,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06941586695932576,582,Last one there buys drinks!
354,6,9,54,69,1.3043478260869565,0.07530655685082074,582,You should have thought this through when you took out that restraining order.
354,4,13,52,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06941586695932576,582,I'll try to have dinner ready by the time you get home.
354,4,13,52,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06941586695932576,582,I think this trip is really bringing us closer together.
354,6,9,54,69,1.3043478260869565,0.07530655685082074,582,"I know, you need your space."
354,4,13,52,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06941586695932576,582,U-turn ahead.
354,4,13,52,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06941586695932576,582,How much longer will you be contagious?
354,8,5,56,69,1.3043478260869565,0.08076875895875199,582,"Again, I'm sorry the stretch limo was unavailable."
354,6,9,54,69,1.3043478260869565,0.07530655685082074,582,I might lose you. I've got only 1 bar.
354,6,9,54,69,1.3043478260869565,0.07530655685082074,582,"OK, I'm going to make a left in ten, nine, eight, seven ......"
354,8,5,56,69,1.3043478260869565,0.08076875895875199,582,Cut beans out of your diet and we'll talk.
354,6,9,54,69,1.3043478260869565,0.07530655685082074,582,These Citibikes are too big to fail.
354,3,15,51,69,1.3043478260869565,0.06627446813222473,582,I'll stop for brunch and you stop for lunch.
370,2,16,49,67,1.2985074626865671,0.06385379250552001,582,"Maybe it's the distance, but I feel like we're both spinning our wheels."
370,5,10,52,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07371674789665346,582,"Steerer to Rear, Steerer to Rear, do you copy?"
370,5,10,52,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07371674789665346,582,Are you sure you're ok ? You seem distant.
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,I thought YOU had the baby.
370,3,14,50,67,1.2985074626865671,0.0673022351167596,582,I'll let them know you're on your way.
370,7,6,54,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07961612267126512,582,Daisy...Daisy? Are you there?
370,6,8,53,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07672315787838994,582,Watcha doin' ?
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,I'm calling to remind you not to use your phone while cycling.
370,6,8,53,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07672315787838994,582,You're falling behind. Pick up the pace!
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,"It's a stretch, but I know we can improve our communication skills. Just follow my lead."
370,5,10,52,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07371674789665346,582,It's a matter of perspective
370,1,18,48,67,1.2985074626865671,0.06020816209588544,582,They need us to be there by noon and 12:01.
370,5,10,52,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07371674789665346,582,Sometimes I feel like I'm doing all the work in this relationship.
370,1,18,48,67,1.2985074626865671,0.06020816209588544,582,This wasn't what I had in mind when I suggested we go for a long bike ride.
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,Your pants just split.
370,3,14,50,67,1.2985074626865671,0.0673022351167596,582,"Exciting? Ok, but can we agree on a yellow light strategy now?"
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,I told you never to call me here.
370,5,10,52,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07371674789665346,582,"Always I heard that behind a great man there is a great woman but honey, this is ridiculous."
370,3,14,50,67,1.2985074626865671,0.0673022351167596,582,You're breaking up...try getting to a place with better reception.
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,Pedal faster. You're falling behind.
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,"When you get to where I am, you'll have four bars."
370,3,14,50,67,1.2985074626865671,0.0673022351167596,582,This wasn't precisely what I meant when I said I wanted some space.
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,Ok. We are headed into the final stretch.
370,4,12,51,67,1.2985074626865671,0.07058239784879214,582,Don't you think this trial separation is getting rediculous?
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,Lean in.
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,It's a bicycle built for two with a restraining order.
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,Left turn at the corner.
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,"I'm about to go into a tunnel, so I might lose you."
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,"I'm not lost, we don't need to ask for directions."
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,Einstein was right.
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,"Sorry, thought this might bring us closer."
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,The therapist said this would save our marriage?!
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,Did you see the dachshund chasing us back there?
394,7,5,53,65,1.2923076923076924,0.0812258156997803,582,No... the light was green.
394,6,7,52,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07821038233716444,582,We're just going to blast through this red light.
394,3,13,49,65,1.2923076923076924,0.068370726287043,582,All I'm saying is I need some space.
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,"Honey, this is not what I meant by spending more time together."
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,"I know we agreed to give each other some space, but this is getting ridiculous."
394,2,15,48,65,1.2923076923076924,0.06475945477108745,582,It's not an activity for couples if you have to lead every time
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,We’re sorry. You must first dial a 1 before calling this number.
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,I said 'trial separation' not trail.
394,3,13,49,65,1.2923076923076924,0.068370726287043,582,"Funny, I've got four bars."
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,Peddle faster...the light just turned yellow!!
394,2,15,48,65,1.2923076923076924,0.06475945477108745,582,Are you finally convinced a divorce would be better than a separation.
394,3,13,49,65,1.2923076923076924,0.068370726287043,582,"I know it's prom, but the stretch limo was more than I could afford."
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,Get this. Now she thinks I have issues with intimacy.
394,2,15,48,65,1.2923076923076924,0.06475945477108745,582,You're the one who wanted more space.
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,"Daisy, Daisy, is this your answer true?"
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,This isn't what I had in mind when I said that I needed space.
394,2,15,48,65,1.2923076923076924,0.06475945477108745,582,I vote we go around the hill instead of over it.
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,It doesn't work if you brake while I'm pedaling.
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,We've got a terrible connection.
394,4,11,50,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07180059500997873,582,"Bob, do NOT try to beat that oncoming train!"
394,3,13,49,65,1.2923076923076924,0.068370726287043,582,Did you fart a while ago?
394,3,13,49,65,1.2923076923076924,0.068370726287043,582,"OK, look on the left ... we're approaching that stretch limo. I'll wave to the driver; you make faces at the guy in the back seat!"
394,8,3,54,65,1.2923076923076924,0.0841332417470283,582,"Oops, I just ran a red light."
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,I don't think this is what the therapist meant by spending time apart.
394,5,9,51,65,1.2923076923076924,0.07507392806131975,582,I told you you couldn't keep up!
428,2,14,47,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06569402390274377,582,Call me when you get home
428,3,12,48,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06948192244484573,582,You know I don't like it when you back seat drive.
428,4,10,49,63,1.2857142857142858,0.07307373205693578,582,Let's stop at the coffee shop up ahead. I'll save you a seat.
428,3,12,48,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06948192244484573,582,I misunderstood what you meant when you asked if I wanted to go in a long bike ride
428,3,12,48,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06948192244484573,582,Just made it to Michigan. How are things in Ohio?
428,3,12,48,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06948192244484573,582,Whattaya mean cell phones create distance between people? Who is this?
428,5,8,50,63,1.2857142857142858,0.07649707894309514,582,I told you never to call me here.
428,5,8,50,63,1.2857142857142858,0.07649707894309514,582,I don't think you're going to make the light. I'll wait for you on the other side of the intersection.
428,2,14,47,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06569402390274377,582,This would go more smoothly if you didn't have your foot on the brake the whole time.
428,5,8,50,63,1.2857142857142858,0.07649707894309514,582,"Alright, look happy, the Jones' house is coming up!"
428,3,12,48,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06948192244484573,582,Lactose intolerant? What gave it away?
428,2,14,47,63,1.2857142857142858,0.06569402390274377,582,I just feel like we're growing apart.
428,5,8,50,63,1.2857142857142858,0.07649707894309514,582,"If I order takeout, can you pick it up?"
441,4,9,48,61,1.278688524590164,0.07440528339613257,582,I don't know... you just seem so distant lately.
441,5,7,49,61,1.278688524590164,0.07799098848386585,582,Is this what you meant by a long bike ride?
441,2,13,46,61,1.278688524590164,0.06665770789935259,582,You're still in violation of the restraining order.
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,Your restraining order says 50 ft... that's why!
441,1,15,45,61,1.278688524590164,0.06242436972019596,582,I know we can beat that train. Don't worry about it
441,2,13,46,61,1.278688524590164,0.06665770789935259,582,It's a trial separation. You lead after next corner.
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,"Take one more sharp turn like that, Larry, and I will kill you!"
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,I think our trial separation is really moving us forward.
441,5,7,49,61,1.278688524590164,0.07799098848386585,582,"If you want to catch up to me, you'll have to peddle faster."
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,I thought you said riding a tandem would bring us closer together.
441,4,9,48,61,1.278688524590164,0.07440528339613257,582,"Four the thousandth and last time, I am peddling!"
441,5,7,49,61,1.278688524590164,0.07799098848386585,582,I just don't understand why we come in first and third every single year.
441,2,13,46,61,1.278688524590164,0.06665770789935259,582,"Daisy, Daisy---can you hear me?"
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,Gotta go. I think someone's following me.
441,5,7,49,61,1.278688524590164,0.07799098848386585,582,Hold tight. Here comes another dead zone.
441,1,15,45,61,1.278688524590164,0.06242436972019596,582,I sense some real distance between us.
441,4,9,48,61,1.278688524590164,0.07440528339613257,582,I'll be home early.
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,Don't forget to pick up milk on your way home.
441,6,5,50,61,1.278688524590164,0.08141893128825868,582,I told you to keep your distance but this is ridiculous.
441,2,13,46,61,1.278688524590164,0.06665770789935259,582,Let's not stay long at this party. I'll do the 'hellos' and you do the 'goodbyes.'
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,This is not what I pictured when you said long bike ride.
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,I'm just not sure this long distance thing is working out.
441,4,9,48,61,1.278688524590164,0.07440528339613257,582,You were right--it's not as fun as a stretch limo.
441,4,9,48,61,1.278688524590164,0.07440528339613257,582,I think we should get a different marriage counsellor.
441,4,9,48,61,1.278688524590164,0.07440528339613257,582,Just follow me.
441,3,11,47,61,1.278688524590164,0.0706377951937,582,I can't talk now. I have some catching up to do.
441,2,13,46,61,1.278688524590164,0.06665770789935259,582,Wait up!
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,That was a big bump -- how'd the kids do?
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,Did you get my text?
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,I'll be in Scotland a'fore ye.
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,Wanted to ask you to answer the phone with your right hand so we don't lose our balance
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,So do you think my butt looks big in these pants?
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,Take your hands off the brakes!
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,I thought being in tandem meant we would have the same cell plan.
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,This is not what I had in mind when you asked me to join you on a long bike tour of New York.
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,Hello. Who is this?
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,'I don't think this long distance relationship thing is gonna work'.
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,We get there when we get there!
468,5,6,48,59,1.271186440677966,0.07956085076239691,582,"Honey, you know how hard it is to manage a long-distance relationship while traveling."
468,1,14,44,59,1.271186440677966,0.06318318471128868,582,Pedal faster.
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,GPS shows I'm on pace to beat the train but should really kick it.
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,What do mean its a long distance call?
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,"No, I've never heard the expression ""Old cog and chain."""
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,"Hold on, I'm going through a tunnel."
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,"Since I’ll be home before you, I’ll let the dog out."
468,5,6,48,59,1.271186440677966,0.07956085076239691,582,"Miss you, too!"
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,We'll be there in 10 or 15 minutes.
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,I feel like I'm pulling all of the weight in the relationship.
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,....and I want two hotel rooms.
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,"I'm sorry, I think we're breaking up."
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,I'll order the pizza if you pick it up.
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,I feel that you're pulling away from me.
468,5,6,48,59,1.271186440677966,0.07956085076239691,582,"Dude, some real bad curves coming up, hang on."
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,I'll see you later.
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,"I'm sorry, but the light was still green when I entered the intersection."
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,Is this what they mean by 'six degrees of separation'?
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,I think we're taking this whole personal space thing too far.
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,You need to make a left at the light. I'm going to go straight ahead!
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,You've seemed so distant lately.
468,5,6,48,59,1.271186440677966,0.07956085076239691,582,You try to make it through another yellow light and we're getting a divorce.
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,"Yes, I had a bean burrito for lunch ... but this is ridiculous!"
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,I'm not interested in a long-distance relationship.
468,2,12,45,59,1.271186440677966,0.06765033899549001,582,I'm glad we found a way to make our long-distance relationship work.
468,3,10,46,59,1.271186440677966,0.07184025265927597,582,"This trial separation isn't working, I want my own bike."
468,4,8,47,59,1.271186440677966,0.0757989144915183,582,The therapist said to give each other more space
506,2,11,44,57,1.263157894736842,0.0686712218487231,582,We used to be so close.
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,How does my tush look now?
506,2,11,44,57,1.263157894736842,0.0686712218487231,582,Heads up...tight corner ahead!
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,There's a hairpin turn ahead. Text me if you don't make it.
506,4,7,46,57,1.263157894736842,0.07725845935738523,582,This is only until the TRO expires.
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,Pull over...I have a wedgie
506,4,7,46,57,1.263157894736842,0.07725845935738523,582,"I get it, you need some space, but this still feels a little codependent to me."
506,2,11,44,57,1.263157894736842,0.0686712218487231,582,"When the marriage counselor said we should do things together, I don't think this is what he had in mind."
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,Why are you following me?
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,I'm so glad we finally found time to do something together
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,Thiiiiis neeeeew waaaarp driiiiiive iiiiis reeeeaaaaalllly cooooooool!!!!!
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,I can make this light but WE can't!
506,4,7,46,57,1.263157894736842,0.07725845935738523,582,Call when you get there.
506,2,11,44,57,1.263157894736842,0.0686712218487231,582,Let me know when we arrive
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,How are things at your end?
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,We need to signal for a right turn.
506,4,7,46,57,1.263157894736842,0.07725845935738523,582,"If we wanna win this thing, you need to drop the restraining order."
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,"No, I have not figured out what to tell the bus driver."
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,"Well, stop using the brakes so much"
506,4,7,46,57,1.263157894736842,0.07725845935738523,582,"No, I'm still here."
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,Let's try and see if we can pop a wheelie!
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,Don't you think it's time you dropped the restraining order?
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,"Honey, let go the brake."
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,Why are you calling? Just text me the directions
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,"Honey, I said text, don't call."
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,Everything ok? You seem really distant.
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,"It was a good idea but, no, you're just going to have to stop eating beans."
506,4,7,46,57,1.263157894736842,0.07725845935738523,582,I'll tell the Mathesons that you're running a little late because of traffic.
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,The couples therapist said he thought it'd be a good way for us to ease back in to doing things together.
506,3,9,45,57,1.263157894736842,0.07309106050835933,582,I can't help but feel we've grown apart.
506,5,5,47,57,1.263157894736842,0.08121228945373259,582,Are you peddling now?
506,2,11,44,57,1.263157894736842,0.0686712218487231,582,Are we almost there?
506,4,7,46,57,1.263157894736842,0.07725845935738523,582,"Lately, you seem distant."
539,3,8,43,54,1.2592592592592593,0.07563005877154262,582,Why is it so hard to get close to you?
540,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,582,"Yes, I'll tell them you'll be 30 seconds late."
540,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,582,It's become obvious that we're drafting apart.
540,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,582,I can still smell you.
540,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,582,Next time you should specify that you want a stretch-LIMO to the airport
540,5,4,46,55,1.2545454545454546,0.08295137441473863,582,What's the point of a trial separation bike if you're going to be calling me all the time?
540,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,582,"Thank you for keeping me on as chauffeur during these rough times, madam."
540,6,2,47,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0869156556133291,582,It will get worse as we get closer to lightspeed.
540,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,582,"No,a left at the next intersection,and swing wide this time, damn it!"
540,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,582,Hey you in the back......get off the brake!
540,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,582,I'm just not ready to get back together yet.
540,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,582,I'll phone you to let you know when I arrive.

540,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,582,A self-powered limo sounded good in theory.
540,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,582,I don't think this is what the marriage counselor meant when he suggested space.

580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,"Honey, are you still following me?"
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,Let's try to beat the train.
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,Can you hear me now? Got to get a smaller bike or a better phone provider.
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,"No, you were the one who insisted on separate vacations."
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,Do you have an extra water bottle
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,Best restraining order ever!
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,Remember that roundabout I mentioned?
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,Let's call our therapists and tell them they were both right. Distance from each other and exercise is improving our relationship.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted us to feel more connected to each other.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,These bike rides have gotten longer since the separation.
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,Let's be sure to stay away from the roundabouts.
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,"Can you call me later, Daisy?"

580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,Heads up. That dachsund who always chases us is on the right.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,Please stop texting me!
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,"I can't talk long, I'm roaming."
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,"Speak up, you sound a little distant."
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,"And where, exactly, were you planning on parking it?"
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,Remember to brake this time when the elastic band pulls back.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,I've only got 2 bars. How many do you have?
580,0,13,40,53,1.2452830188679245,0.059665616229592086,582,I’m going to try to make this light.
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,I feel there is a distance between us.
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,Must go! Someone's following me!
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,I told you I need some space!
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,I told you there's a difference between distancing oneself and getting completely detached
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,Did you call your mother?
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,I'll go ahead an get a table and wait for you to arrive.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,I'm not sure if this will help us decide if we can sustain a long distance relationship.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,Try to catch up. We'll be in a poor reception area soon.
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,"I said, do you ever feel we're drifting apart?"
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,This is why I hate riding with a plumber in the front.
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,"Oh, sure, missing the turn to the marriage counselor is MY fault..."
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,I guess you could call it a long distance relationship.
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,"I tried pedaling faster, mom. He's still right behind me!"
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,"Hold on, I have to make a U - turn."
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,I need more space.
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,It's not my imagination ... I'm sure somebody is following me.
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,"You said you needed a little space, didn't you?"
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,The good news is that the upcoming hairpin turn over the canyon is the only one on today's tour.
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,I still say it would have been cheaper to just buy deodorant.
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,I just think we need a little time apart.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,What do you mean you feel like you're getting farther and farther behind?
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,Do you mean 4:00 your time or my time?
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,Can't talk. Roaming charges.
580,4,5,44,53,1.2452830188679245,0.08039118969013777,582,I'll call you when I get home.
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,"If you get home before me, can you let the dog out?"
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,We can just clear that train. Faster!
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,Do we need milk?
580,1,11,41,53,1.2452830188679245,0.06546506828066133,582,I think we should go straight.
580,3,7,43,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07574334277585738,582,I just crossed into Rhode Island. Have you left New York yet?
580,0,13,40,53,1.2452830188679245,0.059665616229592086,582,I don't think this is what the therapist meant when she said we need to give each other space.
580,2,9,42,53,1.2452830188679245,0.07079099215243659,582,So this is your idea of a trial separation.

693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,I did say it's all downhill from here. Give it a minute.
693,1,9,39,49,1.2244897959183674,0.06691263800308161,582,It may have been red for you but it was green for me.
693,1,9,39,49,1.2244897959183674,0.06691263800308161,582,Be more careful on this next corner
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,Meet me at the corner.
693,3,5,41,49,1.2244897959183674,0.07860013611082545,582,"Seriously, we're divorced now; I think we should get our own bikes."
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,I said turn right
693,1,9,39,49,1.2244897959183674,0.06691263800308161,582,C'mon! You jerkin' my chain again?
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,"Honey, would you let me know when we've crossed the event horizon!"
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,Maybe it's time we head our separate ways.
693,1,9,39,49,1.2244897959183674,0.06691263800308161,582,I want to warn you I had Mexican for lunch.
693,4,3,42,49,1.2244897959183674,0.08383508533242337,582,Let's speed up and get out of here! I just crossed the red light...
693,3,5,41,49,1.2244897959183674,0.07860013611082545,582,I can't believe you are breaking up with me by phone.
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,Stop following me; it's over.
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,"Honey, remember, this bike makes wide turns."
693,1,9,39,49,1.2244897959183674,0.06691263800308161,582,Next time you ride downwind.
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,What's taking you so long?
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,I'll meet you at the Starbucks up ahead. What time will you be there?
693,1,9,39,49,1.2244897959183674,0.06691263800308161,582,What do you mean 'slow down' so you can catch up?
693,3,5,41,49,1.2244897959183674,0.07860013611082545,582,I think I just passed the event horizon.
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,"Biking's great, Jerry, but I still think we need to see a marriage counselor!"
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,I'm worried that this long distance relationship is starting to affect where we are going.
693,1,9,39,49,1.2244897959183674,0.06691263800308161,582,"Wow, you've never said I'm right before. Oh, turn right? OK."
693,2,7,40,49,1.2244897959183674,0.0729906929723637,582,"Please, let's not drag this out."
693,3,5,41,49,1.2244897959183674,0.07860013611082545,582,Dead skunk coming your way...
796,4,2,39,45,1.2222222222222223,0.08926687311226543,582,Why do we always have to take the long way?
796,2,6,37,45,1.2222222222222223,0.07712569361139826,582,What do you mean I'm still getting my sweat on you?
798,2,3,27,32,1.21875,0.09769908334829336,582,"This time no turns, okay?"
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,"But should I turn left when I get there, or when you get there?"
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,But I thought riding a tandem bike would bring us closer together.
799,0,10,36,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06148754619013455,582,"Hey babe, can you hurry up?"
799,3,4,39,46,1.2173913043478262,0.08172679524563294,582,It becomes normal length when we get to 99.999999% of the speed of light.
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,Whose turn is it?
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,"Pothole in 10, 9, 8..."""
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,You're having an affair aren't you?
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,Bump ahead!
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,"When we get closer to the singularity, our data minutes become infinite"
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,"Damn... I left my water bottle at the house."" ""I see it on the counter. I'll grab it."" ""Can you make sure we set the alarm while you're there?"" ""Sure thing. How's traffic?"
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,I'll be home when you get there tonight honey.
799,4,2,40,46,1.2173913043478262,0.08743827900868612,582,"Roger that, rollerblader at 9 o'clock"
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,"Did you remember to attach the ""Caution Wide Right Turns"" sign?"
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,"Haven't heard we are attached at the hip yet, have you?"
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,Sometimes I feel like I do all the work
799,3,4,39,46,1.2173913043478262,0.08172679524563294,582,"When you said ""we'll take a stretch"" I thought you meant a limousine."
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,What time is it where you are now?
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,Lean left on 3!
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,Is this enough of your own space?
799,3,4,39,46,1.2173913043478262,0.08172679524563294,582,You're breaking up. Can you pedal harder?
799,4,2,40,46,1.2173913043478262,0.08743827900868612,582,There's a bug on my neck?
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,"Don't worry, son, ma's got your back."
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,I should have turned left WHERE?
799,1,8,37,46,1.2173913043478262,0.06889776419712876,582,"You are back-seat steering again, dear."
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,"Hey, can I call you back in five? I think we're plummeting to our deaths right now."
799,3,4,39,46,1.2173913043478262,0.08172679524563294,582,You've just been so distant lately.
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,I'm not sure about this whole long distance thing.
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,What do you mean by a turning radius?
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,"Ya, I'm trying to give her more space now."
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,"Sit tight, I am going to turn around."
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,Are you still with me?
799,2,6,38,46,1.2173913043478262,0.07558495542263939,582,It's great spending more time together.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"Make it quick,I hate getting hit with roaming charges."
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,I think the seperation is working.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Just admit you want a divorce.
831,0,9,35,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0615132074247489,582,I think I need to stop in a minute...you should stop in two.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,How does my ass look from back there?
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"I think I misunderstood when you said ""Long bicycle ride."""
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,"Sorry. At first, you didn't sound like Daisy."
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,So how's the weather?
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"I'll order the macchiatos, you pick them up."
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Maybe we should start seeing other people.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,"Honey, can you please ask for directions?"
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"Our therapist is right, cycling has brought us so much closer."
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"Say no more, I'm way ahead of you."
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,Did we just pass through a wormhole?
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"Marvin, this is NOT a stretch limo"
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,The Wi-Fi on this bike is terrible.
831,4,1,39,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0895109183139428,582,Watch out for traffic at the next turn!
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,"When you get to the picnic, tell them I'm right behind you."
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,"Pull over, I have to pee"
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Try taking your foot off the brake.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,You were right: it is possible to keep our training schedule without violating the restraining order.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,Oh you're crazy... That light was green.
831,0,9,35,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0615132074247489,582,This distance biking is really bringing us together.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,We're experimenting with a trial separation.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,My wife and I just separated.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,I'm not sure this elastic bicycle invention will catch on.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,The separation agreement says we switch at Battery Park.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,My therapist says this trial separation isn't working.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,"Understood, I'll be a little more cautious at the railroad crossing."
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,I'll text you at the red light!
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"So far, so good, Mr. Armstrong. Tour de France officials suspect nothing."
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Are you still going uphill?
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,How are we growing apart?
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Maybe cutting out the middleman wasn't such a great idea...
831,4,1,39,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0895109183139428,582,Okay. We won't stop for Mexican next time.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,You're falling behind
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,"Oh, the usual. You?"
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,I think our therapy sessions are working!
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,"No, you cannot steer. I am hanging up."
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,Do you want to reconsider the restraining order?
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,"Okay, okay. Will you stop riding my tail?"
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Pedal faster. I can't afford these roaming charges.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Why do you always have to be such a drag.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,This was great before we got these phones.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Watch out! We're nearing a turning point in our relationship.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,I SAID I want a divorce.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Thanx for giving me my space.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,The reception is terrible. I only have two long bars.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,How can I convince you that this doesn't make us get there sooner?
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"One, those screeching sounds are not convincing and two, I know we are not in a tunnel."
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Let's keep our distance for a while.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,"This is not what I meant by a trial separation."" (from my wife, Karen Schapiro); or from me: ""I said to get a stretch LIMO."
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,On your left.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,We need an intercom system so we can cut done on our data usage.
831,4,1,39,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0895109183139428,582,I'm calling to give you a heads up that I just farted.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,I'm NOT trying to outpace you.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Damn...I though spending time together would bring us closer.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Winter is coming.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,I told you UberBike wouldn't catch on.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,I think I need to read the descriptions more carefully on Amazon.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,This is the shortest long-distance relationship I've ever heard of.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,I'm pretty sure I'm being followed.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Whoever gets home first should walk the dog.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Can you smell me now?
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Let me know when you start to feel the rain.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,"If it starts to rain, I'll call you back."
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,You do realize this is another long distance charge?
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"I'm sorry, but I just don't know if I can do a long-distance thing any more."
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,Are you following me?
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,I am not sure this is what the marriage counsellor meant by spending time together.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Just tandem calling. Can you hear me now?
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,We're OK. The restraining order simply said '...not within 12 feet...' of one another.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,... but you said you wanted more space in our relationship!

831,0,9,35,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0615132074247489,582,But you said you needed space.
831,0,9,35,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0615132074247489,582,So now you're willing to talk about the distance between us?

831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,I think this separation is going to work.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"No, I don't need to ask for directions."

831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,I feel we should steer the conversation in a different direction.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"Yes dad, I can feel the bonding."
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,"When Doc said share a hobby, I think she meant in the same time zone."

831,0,9,35,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0615132074247489,582,I've got the sense you've become more distant.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Synchronize activity trackers. We're entering Queens.
831,3,3,38,44,1.2045454545454546,0.08339737432901621,582,"Our therapist was right, this time apart is really good for us."

831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Sharp curve ahead!
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,You really think we've grown apart?
831,0,9,35,44,1.2045454545454546,0.0615132074247489,582,"No, you can't wear the yellow jersey."

831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,Quit complaining! I told you it was going to be a long bike ride.
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,You don't think this is taking a trial separation too far?

831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,How about we end this seperation?
831,1,7,36,44,1.2045454545454546,0.06957698714453991,582,We should be there in about two minutes and two minutes and two seconds respectively.

831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,I feel like we need couples therapy.
831,2,5,37,44,1.2045454545454546,0.07679869525286717,582,Not clear at all. I'm going to have to change my provider.

958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,Say again? You sound so distant.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,Are we drifting apart?
958,3,2,37,42,1.1904761904761905,0.0851185907576086,582,Sharp left coming up.

958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,But our therapist said activities were supposed to bring us closer together.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,Long distance charges may apply.

958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,I don't think I'm ready for a long-distance relationship.
958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,What do you mean you don't feel like we're connected anymore?
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,I guess this means we are still taking a break?
958,3,2,37,42,1.1904761904761905,0.0851185907576086,582,Wasn't this supposed to bring us closer together?
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,Give me a brake.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,Are you still mad about my leaving the toilet seat up?
958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,Don't you think this trial separation is getting out of hand?
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,For our next tandem let's get the Bluetooth

958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,"If you recall, we're trying to reduce our workout conversations."
958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,I just don't think it's far enough to fool our spouses.
958,0,8,34,42,1.1904761904761905,0.061325801544455674,582,I think you left the hand brake on.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,"Honey, when I said some time apart would do us both good, this is not what I had in mind."
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,I told you no garlic and onions before a ride!
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,This ride is much longer than I thought it would be.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,No backseat driving.

958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,It was the only way we could compete in the tandem race and stay in compliance with the restraining order.

958,3,2,37,42,1.1904761904761905,0.0851185907576086,582,I'm steering us to the attorney. This trial separation isn't working out.
958,0,8,34,42,1.1904761904761905,0.061325801544455674,582,It just feels like we're struggling to really turn a corner as a couple.

958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,I thought biking would bring us closer together.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,You may want to hold your breath in a couple of seconds.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,You know I hate it when you call me at work.
958,3,2,37,42,1.1904761904761905,0.0851185907576086,582,"Return to the limo, then, Madam?"
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,Why would they say we look like a dachshund?
958,0,8,34,42,1.1904761904761905,0.061325801544455674,582,And then Todd realized the call wasn't coming from inside the house.

958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,I'm making record time. How about you?

958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,You're the one who needed more space.
958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,Your what? Separation anxiety?
958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,"The light's about to turn red, but I think I can just make it."
958,2,4,36,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07799829681942307,582,It's a hoax: distance doesn't makes the heart grow fonder.
958,1,6,35,42,1.1904761904761905,0.07015906299901953,582,I can still ride your ass from back here

1093,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,582,I'm calling to discuss what our counselor said about engineering artificial distance in our marriage.
1093,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,582,Our therapist said a tandem bike! This IS a tandem bike!!

1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,I'm still not dropping the restraining order.
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,I was thinking about our intimacy issues.
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,"Hurry up, you're falling behind."

1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,I'm not sure either. I'll give you a call when I get there.
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,"This is not what I had in mind, when I said I wanted to take a long distance bike ride."
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,That's right--straight ahead.
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,I should have supper on the table by the time you get home.
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"Sorry, but you are finishing third."

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"And then she said, 'Where are you going to park it?'"
1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,We are trying long distance

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,Don't worry. When it comes to stretch limos they get what they pay for.
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,I'll be there in 5 minutes. You'll be there in 10.
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,Give me your answer do. Have we grown apart?
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,This may not be the best time to tell you but.....
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"Well, they did say we could cover more ground with this bike."
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"Well, this is a fine time to tell me there's a funny noise coming from the chain."

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"No, I didn't call you, I was checking voice mail at work."
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,I'm having second thoughts about our long-distance relationship.
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"Hello, which way are we turning?"
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,This bike is for couples who are staying together because of the children.
1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,"Honey, you've become a real drag."
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,I enjoy these father-son talks.

1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,"It's not you, I just need some space."
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,Leave the kids out of this.
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,I hate how we're growing apart.
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"I want a separation. Well, more separation."

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"The trainer said to stretch more before riding, but this is ridiculous."
1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,It is hard to hear you. Please text me instead.
1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,Take off the brake.
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,"Frankly, I'm getting a little tired of this long-distance relationship."

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,Not exactly what I meant when I said I think we need some space from each other in our relationship.
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,"Jim, are you there?! I think I am losing you!"

1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,Our relationship? Well right now I'm feeling very distant from you.
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,"Honey, do you have the water bottle?"
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,This was brilliant! We should cross the finish line two bicycle lengths ahead of everyone else!
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"This bike was a great idea. But, you got any ideas about the sharp curve ahead?"
1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,"No, I would come in first and you'd take second."

1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,Brake honey.
1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,This isn't the kind of long distance romance I had in mind.

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"I don't care if it's natural, Gary. You're going back to regular deodorant."
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,You promise you're pedaling?

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"A wheelie? Hey, you know I'm up in the air with that."

1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,I didn't miss the stop. I can't figure out how.

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,Bicycling as exercise is kind of a stretch.
1197,0,6,31,37,1.162162162162162,0.06143325088732366,582,Dude? We got a stretch!
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,Not what I meant by long-distance bike rides.

1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,It's the parking that's tough!
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,This isn't what I had in mind when you asked for a trial separation agreement.

1197,2,2,33,37,1.162162162162162,0.08232282379503182,582,We must be half way across the state by now. Why on earth did we buy a bike that can't make turns?
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,"So, in 500 feet, I turn left, and you turn right."
1197,1,4,32,37,1.162162162162162,0.07263295268737431,582,So should I put my relationship status as 'it's complicated'?

1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,How much longer do you think?
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I win.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Is this what our therapist meant when she spoke of separation anxiety?
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"Sorry, but I'm not in this for the long haul."

1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"We are no longer in tandem, I want a unicycle."
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Did you say 'trial separation'?
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,I'm developing separation anxiety.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"I don't know if it's me but lately, you've seem so distant!"
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,When do you think you'll get here?
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I thought biking would bring us closer.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I feel like we are getting further and further apart
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I'm having second thoughts about our new flagpole delivery service.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,It's sunny up here; how about you?
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,I can't hear you. I think I'm in a bad reception zone.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Welcome to hook and ladder school.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Did you say TRAIN!!!
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,What's the problem? Wind breaking is what the person in front does.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Where do you want to stop for lunch?

1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,I think we overdid it with the stretching.
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,Do you think we'll incur roaming charges?
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"To my chagrin, the time had not yet come for the eco-friendly limo."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Bad connection. I'm losing you.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"When they said long-distance biking, I don't think this is what they meant."
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"We forgot about the ""S-Turns"" coming up."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Stop rushing me, Linda. I'm already ahead of you."
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Do they see us? Ours is bigger. Right? Are they looking? Let's go around again.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Catch up will you!
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Next time order a bike with chain drive to the wheels.
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,I sense something has come between us.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,How's the weather back there?
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I warned you I had issues with intimacy.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,I feel as if something is keeping us apart.
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,The restraining order really makes this awkward.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Just confirming that we agree: this doesn't need a caption to be funny, right?"
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Honey, did you remember to load the remarkably long water bottle into the remarkably long water bottle holder?"
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"Can you pick up the pace, you're holding up the rear!"
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Speed Bump ahead, 10 seconds......for you, 12 seconds."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,You should pick up a tail wind on the next hill.
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,I think we've grown apart.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"You forgot what? No, we can not turn around."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,You sure you want to be in this for the long haul?
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"Hold on, the guy behind me is yelling about something."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"No, No, No I said We are breaking up."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Just think of it as a stretch limo, honey."
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,"8th and 42nd coming up. Um, we might have a problem here..."
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,I told you there should be some distance in our togetherness.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,I just feel like we're not as close as we used to be . . .
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Faster son! Our trainer said we shouldn't overstretch.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Because I'm a Type A personality and you're a Type B. that's why.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,And I'll be making a left turn in about zero three seconds.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Is it a right or left turn up here on Albuquerque?
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"So don't freak out, but it looks like there's a left turn up ahead."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Honey, wait up!"
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Just stay far behind me they don't know we're together.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,We've just grown apart.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,What do you mean you're not in my time zone?
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"You're the one who served the garlicky refried beans, and kale filled burritos grandes."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Are you sure we're doing this right?
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Don't worry--I'll be sure to text you before the next turn.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I used rubber glue to assemble the frame.
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Biking was meant to bring us closer together
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Looks like Einstein was right.
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,It happens as you approach light speed.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Modern Togetherness
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,Why do you keep veering to the right?
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Any idea how we turn?
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Our psychiatrist recommended that we spend time apart..........
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I told you not to call me from up front. You know how expensive long-distance charges are!
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Try not to make any more turns.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Ground Control, I'm through the black hole...didn't feel a thing, but it's bleached my T-shirt."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Black hole ahead.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,"Doctor, I'm getting that feeling of being followed again."
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,I feel like you've become distant.
1357,1,3,30,34,1.1470588235294117,0.07472293375658888,582,Can we please talk about our separation?
1357,2,1,31,34,1.1470588235294117,0.0858256839383612,582,"Honey, I can see your butt crack."
1357,0,5,29,34,1.1470588235294117,0.06165213406602946,582,This is not bringing us closer.

1500,0,5,30,35,1.1428571428571428,0.06001200360120041,582,I miss you.
1500,0,5,30,35,1.1428571428571428,0.06001200360120041,582,What do you mean? Where are the kids?
1500,1,3,31,35,1.1428571428571428,0.07267814558130975,582,But you said you needed some space in our relationship !
1500,2,1,32,35,1.1428571428571428,0.08344330478861452,582,"I said, slow down on those sharp corners!"

1500,0,5,30,35,1.1428571428571428,0.06001200360120041,582,How do you take a turn on this thing?
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Race you home!
1560,2,0,29,31,1.1290322580645162,0.08970603705210413,582,Let me call you back. I'm heading into a tunnel.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Back off!
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Don't forget--we won't always be in the same time zone.
1560,2,0,29,31,1.1290322580645162,0.08970603705210413,582,Is it my turn to draft yet?
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,I think you missed my point when I suggested we take the long way home.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,If you don't hurry up we'll never finish this ride.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"Yes dear, we still have a good connection."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"When you get here, let's go get a beer"
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"You may think we've never been farther apart, but technically we've also never been closer."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,You said this would make us feel closer.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"Yes, your ringtone irritates me too."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Sharp left coming up. I'll text you the rest.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,We're going the long way.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,I feel like we're drifting apart.
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,My wife and I bought this bike just before our divorce.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"This isn't working for me, I think we should get a legal separation."
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,Pothole at one o'clock!
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,Text STOP before you brake.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"We agreed last time, sweet, then savory. Donuts, then fries."
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,This bike sucks!
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Do you have any idea how much this call is costing me?
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,Please signal for a left turn.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Imagine the long-distance charges.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,I'm not liking this long distance relationship.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Why aren't we as close as we used to be?
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"When you suggested a bicycle-built-for-two, I was picturing something more romantic."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,What?
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,"I'm running the yellow, but you may have to stop."
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,"Personally, I prefer the stretch moped."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Do you think we are roaming?
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,Your own bike? But I thought the whole point of this was to bring us closer together.
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,I think I'm being followed.
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,2 minute warning - left turn!
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,I wonder what the Long Island is like.
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,This long distance relationship just isn't working for me anymore.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,We find this a valuable training exercise for our new stretch-limo recruits.
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,In thirty seconds you will experience a bad bump.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"No, you can't catch up to me by pedaling faster."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"Say, Any idea how we are going to make a U turn?"
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,We never seem to catch up!
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,This concludes your bike and technology tour of Silicon Valley.
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,"Fuck you, Bitch"
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,I'll be the backseat driver next time
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"Hey it's me, I'm gonna stop up ahead and brew some coffee. I'll have a cup waiting for you when you arrive."
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,Are you still mad at me?
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,I think I'm ready for the next step in our relationship.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"I thought a ""Stetch Tandem Bike"" would come with more seating and a bar."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"I said, ""S T R E T C H limo! Limo! Limo! Limo!"
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,I'm so glad we're able to spend quality time together like this.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"When you rented the bike, how many did they say it was built for?"
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,I have to pee again.
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,Get off your phone and start peddling
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,Queen of the Slipscreen
1560,1,2,28,31,1.1290322580645162,0.07678955299508441,582,"Hold on, sign says S curves ahead."
1560,0,4,27,31,1.1290322580645162,0.06120537406777509,582,"Hello, can you hear me now? Honey, if you can hear me, I told the guy over the phone, ‘extended warrantee’."
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"From my perspective, your new biker shorts make your ass look downright tiny."
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,I just feel you and I are too far apart.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,Have you got my back?
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"Just so you know, I can tell when you stop pedaling."
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Don't turn!
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"You go left, I go right and we got them!"
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,This long distance relationship isn't working out for me.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"See, it feels like I'm right next to you."
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"Honey, we're in this together!"
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"No, Sarah, it's all about the journey, not the destination!"
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"I appreciate the effort, but when I said I needed a little more space, this isn't what I had in mind."
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Our relationship isn't clicking on all gears.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"Remind me again, why did we pick this bike?"
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,Don't worry--this still counts as legal separation.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"Hon, I've never felt closer to you than I do now."
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,How does the 2020 election look from there?
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,Cab to caboose: this chain's cruisin' toward a train.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"Just letting' you know, we've got a corner coming up."
1617,2,0,30,32,1.125,0.08695104295503155,582,"No, they said you are a little behind."
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,You said we needed some distance.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,We've grown apart.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"Honey, do you like my extra long bike?"" ""Well, at least now you have ONE thing that is extra long."
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,We love exercise but aren't talking to each other.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,It's over. We're drifting apart.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Has that fart made it down to you yet?
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Our tour's over--the road tees up ahead.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,The election has really effected everything around us
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"Well , told you it was going to be a long ride."
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,Well you said you wanted a little more distance in our relationship.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,I can't accept 'we are going through a bad cell' anymore as an excuse.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,"OK, we're coming to the turn, so listen carefully..."
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,You're starting to break up. I think I'm out of range.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,How is the weather there?
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Okay...I'll call you when I get there.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,I think stretching is a waste of time.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,Thanks goodness our provider got rid of those long distance fees.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,This is not the trial separation I had in mind.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"Hey, did you bring your selfie stick?"
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,You're getting home first so you make dinner!
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Carol always took Tom's attempts at a break-up too literally.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"You're a distracted cyclist!"" ""No, you're a distracted cyclist!"
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,I'm glad we found a way to put some distance between us.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,I think we should break up.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"Technically, I know, but it doesn't feel very tandem."
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,Right.....left.....right.....left
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,You better be peddling back there!.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,I think it would be a great idea if you started peddling.
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,How much longer?
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,So much for drafting
1617,0,4,28,32,1.125,0.05939887041393643,582,You promised this would bring us closer together.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Knew we should've taken those couple drifting classes...
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,Remind me again why size matters.
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"Honey, if it's distance you want, I can stay at Jim's."
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,I'm so glad we get to spend this quality time together
1617,1,2,29,32,1.125,0.07446042464765883,582,"Will you be needing me any more this evening, Miss Trump?"
