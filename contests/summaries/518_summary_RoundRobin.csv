1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Should we card him? He doesn't look under 6 to me.
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He was there when the sand was delivered.
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,... And when his numbers dipped the brokerage firm banished him to the desert.
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,We may be here awhile - he keeps losing count.

1441,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Maybe WE'RE just a mirage.
1441,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Wall Street gave him $25 million to disrupt the sandbox industry.
1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Somehow I don't think water is what he's looking for.
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"When mom puts him out, dad prefers the cat's box to the dog's house."
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Forty years later and he still hasn't come in from recess. Legendary.
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,It's OK. My drunk uncle thinks he's a cat.

1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He lost his metal detector.
1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,I guess that's why the Sandman prefers to come at night...

1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"The sad thing is, he thought he'd asked for dessert."
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"... and in the winter, he used to walk to school barefoot, uphill, both ways."
1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,The buzzards are here. How much longer for recess?

1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"If he thinks he's a cat, we will have to play somewhere else."
1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,"So, can't he, like, find a desert to play in?"
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,No wonder my VR glasses were so cheap!
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,See! they never think outside the box
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Dad always goes to the worst case scenario.
1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,I think he's looking for his dignity.
1441,3,1,24,28,1.25,0.12198750911856665,518,He still hasn't learn to use a toilet
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He says he couldn't afford a metal detector.
1441,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"His boss told him to get lost, but he's out of vacation days."

1441,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Maybe if we add water he'll think he's at the beach.
1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,I'll admit that I doubted the litter boxes for the homeless idea.

1441,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Do you think he needs a drink or a cigarette?
1441,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,518,I've already suggested that he think outside the box.
