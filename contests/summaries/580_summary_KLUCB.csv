545,6,14,84,104,1.25,0.05422755142758354,580,Because I'm the one who convinced the Queen that trumpeters should announce her return.

545,7,12,85,104,1.25,0.05592256996255918,580,Not doing my job? I urge you to consider both sides.
545,5,16,83,104,1.25,0.052477812801650835,580,I'm assuming this is what she meant by 'you're sleeping on the couch tonight'.
545,6,14,84,104,1.25,0.05422755142758354,580,It was either this or a standing desk.

574,3,19,80,102,1.2450980392156863,0.04913595201274502,580,I think the ad for hangman referred to a different type of hanging and swinging...
574,3,19,80,102,1.2450980392156863,0.04913595201274502,580,It's not my fault there's two columns on this side.

584,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,580,It's because you only have one column
584,4,16,80,100,1.24,0.05148305595538256,580,"They're binge-watching Game of Thrones in the barracks, so I'm crashing here."

584,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,580,"Hey, check this out...contains eco-friendly memory foam, cooling gel, and organic cotton."
584,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,580,Quickly....he's coming and my legs have fallen asleep!

584,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,580,I'm starting to think about myself more.
584,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,580,Do you really think he'll notice?
584,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,580,Relax. He'll be on the golf course for hours.
584,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,580,I have a better chance at 'Game of Hammocks.'
584,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,580,Are you the one who leaked that I'm abdicating the throne due to hemorrhoids?
584,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,580,The seat of power is a royal pain in the ass.

584,3,18,79,100,1.24,0.04948216697442473,580,We call it The Staycation.
584,5,14,81,100,1.24,0.053409037180286764,580,What? I just wanted to try it. Now help me outa this damn thing before he comes back!
584,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,580,Oh Come on! What are the odds a siege happens by day?
584,10,4,86,100,1.24,0.06215003027051768,580,"Al, I had the most horrific nightmare. In the distant future, in a land far, far away, where the king's descendants lived, an evil called 45 rose to power and set out to destroy all that was good."
584,6,12,82,100,1.24,0.0552679423766206,580,TELL TRUMP I'M BUSY...

610,5,13,79,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05438897522798766,580,This is why you should always guard the side with two pillars.
610,7,9,81,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05820407108575367,580,Just hand me the pillow. No one has to know.

1598,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,580,"If his excellency shows up soon, I'll be between my post and post-mortem!"
1598,0,7,46,53,1.1320754716981132,0.04695159976668159,580,He said he was going to the spa so you know he won't be back for a couple of hours.
1598,1,5,47,53,1.1320754716981132,0.05413078722488102,580,The Queen has asked me to remind His Majesty that royal edicts won't decree themselves.
1598,0,7,46,53,1.1320754716981132,0.04695159976668159,580,The commute from Nottingham has become a killer. I'm spending the night here during the week.
1598,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,580,But the king said to keep our guard up.
1598,2,3,48,53,1.1320754716981132,0.06046347269649694,580,I've decided to be true to myself.

1762,0,7,47,54,1.1296296296296295,0.04613879568230499,580,Don't worry about me. . . I can keep guard with one eye shut!
1762,3,1,50,54,1.1296296296296295,0.06500172709792945,580,Heed my warning. Summer is coming.
1762,2,3,49,54,1.1296296296296295,0.059383604691421,580,You think _you're_ tired?
1767,1,5,49,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05225259457122248,580,And then I'm going to eat a sheetcake.
1767,1,5,49,55,1.1272727272727272,0.05225259457122248,580,Tell His Majesty to hold the trumpets.
1769,2,3,51,56,1.125,0.057335309036732875,580,Wake me when the Hundred Years' War is over.
1769,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,580,"Every weekend he plays golf. This way I'll be all rested up when he gets back on Monday. Meanwhile, you'll be dead on your feet. So shut up and let me get my beauty rest."
1769,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,580,I know the King is in danger. I just can't get out of the hammock.
1769,2,4,58,64,1.125,0.052231930877334055,580,Just tell the king I'm installing the new slingshot.
1769,1,5,50,56,1.125,0.05136133772583239,580,What? The King said to make ourselves at home!
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I like these new union rules!
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,It's more efficient to work from home.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"Hagar, whistle twice when his Highness approaches."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,I was getting varicose veins from all the standing!
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,You just never know which way Trump is going to swing...
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"Wait a minute, did His Majesty say 'fix me a hammock', or 'fix me a ham hock?"
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,That last crusade really left me beat.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,They say it's supposed to be good for your back.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,My kingdom for some white noise!
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,I thought I saw a mouse.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Wake me up when our shift is over.
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,I don't know what he's on about. My head ain't so uneasy lying down in this.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"While England 'may swing like a pendulum do', I , as King, snooze to a modest mersey beat that rocks me gently."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,This is a lot more comfortable.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"AS USUAL, THE RIGHT GUARD HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE LEFT GUARD IS DOING."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"I'm not lazy, i'm on a staycation."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,So she's at that 'pea and a mattress' stage of dating?
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"The cat's away, the mice will play, I say."
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,He never takes me to Bedminster.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Not my king!
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"Thor, Airbnb needs to know this was not as advertised"
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Cancel the river cruise.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,You'll be strung up permanently if His Royal Highness catches you in that hammock.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,I love the weekends.
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,"Yes, it's a presidential display that I have swung Alt.Right"
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,"Heavy lies the crown, huh Mr. Rumpus?"
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"Relax, you know this isn't the throne he rules from."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Father's Day gift.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,It is even money when the king returns you will be swinging in the other direction.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Far more comfortable than the Iron Throne.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"Well, he did say he would hang me."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I enjoyed outdoor naps before my barber warned me of the harmful effects of radiation
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Your time is up. It's my turn.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I'm gonna sleep my way to the top.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"No, you may not climb in with me!"
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Hey Bro- grab me a cold grog...
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Just tell me when the queen comes.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,You better pack up your hammock. I hear the King is cutting short his vacation to sign an Executive Order.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Cover me.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,You gotta admit this job's a lot sweeter than guarding the other throne room.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"The royal renovations are behind schedule but hey, a King's gotta do what a King's gotta do."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"You do know, sire, that lullabies haven't yet been invented."
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,"... and this is why he's ""The King of Swing?"""
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,It don't mean I'm King if I ain't got that swing.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Hope this is what his majesty meant by hanging!
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"The Crusades can wait. Prithee, yon Coleman with a bounty of wine coolers."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"So, you're absolutely sure he's ok with this?"
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"If winter is coming, can summer be far behind?"
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,Come now. Sing 'soft kitty'
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"He ordered me hanged, he didn't say how."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Now set some plants around me.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"I don't know about your employment situation, but the ad I responded to promised unfettered access to the royal hammock when the king was away."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"Just because I don't want to sit in my BIG chair, doesn't mean I don't want pillow."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,The throne just has no back support.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Royal Guards Union: Required contractual breaks
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,Wake me when The Crusades are over.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"I have to sleep here, so that I can wake up His Majesty at 6 a.m., so that he can do his daily morning tweet storm."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Find your beach.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I like a little hammock time.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Really hate my tan line.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"Oh, I'm a union delegate."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,But it's knight time...
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Has anyone invented the Pina Colada yet???
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"If the Pope retired, so can I."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I found my beach.
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,"I tried to set it up near the moat, but there's an alligator-supremacist rally going on."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Wake me when the war is over.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Give me a wake-up call before he gets here.
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,The King hath gone to relieve his bowels and we all knoweth he will not return in a fortnight.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,At least these Dark Ages are good for something.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,You're resting in your funeral shroud!
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"We may have gotten it through collective bargaining, but there's only room for one."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"Listen, Brian – in this job, you've got to learn to pace yourself and go with the flow."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I'll prove to you he likes me best.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Number three on my bucket list.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Thrones are so last season.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Well we are working the swing shift.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I'm not sleeping. I'm his majesty's human slingshot ammo.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,My kingdom for a Posturepedic
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Someday I’ll show you the picture I have of the king coming out of Miss Lilly’s with a pig under his arm.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"Remember, you did not see me sleeping on the job."
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,My massage therapist said it would help my back.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"It's called ""glamping."""
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Wake me up when 'Game of Thrones' declares a winner.
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,What do you think 'being a pillar' means?
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,I'm trying to convey a laid-back image.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Why are you looking at me like that? The king did say to hang here until he got back.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"Get me some palm trees, a fair maiden and a pina colada."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Hey. Did he say 'Good night' or 'Good knight'?
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"No, don't tell anyone that I'm napping."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"It's really quite simple Reggie ... all Ah'm askin' is a few lines of ""All frew th'night"" and I'll be off, 'fore y'know it."
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Should've taken off my socks
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,We call them Hammic.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Remember before his coronation when he said he'd never leave the castle?
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,I told him the Kingdom of Google has them.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,"Oh don't be so naive, all guards sleep on duty!"
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"Apparently, this is what my subjects do"
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Would you have the front desk give me a wake-up call at 7?
1774,2,2,46,50,1.12,0.061544740652965765,580,Relax! He's trying to explain to MSNBC why he's had this throne installed so I don't expect him back today.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"The Royal Footstool, Sire ?"
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,What the cat fur is going on here?
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Enough beheadings. Time to relax.
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,I'm too royal to sit upright!
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I want to be rocked.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,I suppose you regret not joining the union when you had the chance...
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Did you hear about Brannon?
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,Wake up my sire! Jon Snow is about to be murdered...again.
1774,1,4,45,50,1.12,0.05451081150953976,580,"They said he was regal, but actually he's nothing but a royal pain in the ass!"
1774,0,6,44,50,1.12,0.046423076597919784,580,Warn me before the court arrives and I'll get back on the throne.
