374,9,31,91,131,1.3740458015267176,0.05346027425464379,557,Maybe just a bite.

406,12,23,93,128,1.3671875,0.05749774660724903,557,I'm concerned it violates the spirit of the agreement.

862,11,13,89,113,1.3097345132743363,0.06039226757267352,557,Better wrap it to go.
862,8,19,86,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05633065367882912,557,so you say the secret ingredient will improve my cognitive function?
862,10,15,88,113,1.3097345132743363,0.059069435156215294,557,Home made sin? My favorite!
862,6,23,84,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05345172511803567,557,"At least when we get kicked out, we’ll have a solid business model"
862,7,21,85,113,1.3097345132743363,0.054910060380490525,557,"I think, calories will be the least of our worries..."
862,7,21,85,113,1.3097345132743363,0.054910060380490525,557,That looks positively sinful!
862,8,19,86,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05633065367882912,557,I thought we were eating out.
862,8,19,86,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05633065367882912,557,What's a window sill ?
862,6,23,84,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05345172511803567,557,We'll be banished and have diabetes.
862,6,23,84,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05345172511803567,557,"Okay, but just a sliver. I'm going to have to fit into a fig leaf tomorrow."
862,7,21,85,113,1.3097345132743363,0.054910060380490525,557,On which day did He create ovens again??
862,6,23,84,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05345172511803567,557,NOT forbidden fruit pie again!
862,7,21,85,113,1.3097345132743363,0.054910060380490525,557,…and you’re naked.
862,10,15,88,113,1.3097345132743363,0.059069435156215294,557,Your mom's recipe?
862,8,19,86,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05633065367882912,557,"Wow, is that homemade?"
862,5,25,83,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05195246967372173,557,Uuuh... I still think that counts as forbidden.
862,7,21,85,113,1.3097345132743363,0.054910060380490525,557,A Birthday Pie?!?!?! I'm glad I wore my birthday suit.

862,5,25,83,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05195246967372173,557,"Maybe just a slice, I'm watching my knowledge."
862,11,13,89,113,1.3097345132743363,0.06039226757267352,557,What a surprise! I haven't seen you since the fall.
862,10,15,88,113,1.3097345132743363,0.059069435156215294,557,Did you remember to turn off the oven?
862,8,19,86,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05633065367882912,557,"I wanna say apple, but melons are on my mind."
862,9,17,87,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05771629195278621,557,"Mock apple pie, I hope."
862,9,17,87,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05771629195278621,557,"Since I am about to incur God's terrible wrath, could you make it a la mode."
862,5,25,83,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05195246967372173,557,This will definitely stick to my missing rib.
862,8,19,86,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05633065367882912,557,"Wait, just like my who used to make?"
862,6,23,84,113,1.3097345132743363,0.05345172511803567,557,I feel like this is a trap.
912,8,18,84,110,1.309090909090909,0.057390363323567666,557,"I forgot our anniversary again, didn't I."
913,7,21,86,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05449403549126256,557,I still can't figure out how you got the recipe.
913,7,21,86,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05449403549126256,557,Are you SURE baking takes the sin out of apples?
913,5,25,84,114,1.3070175438596492,0.051566356414556015,557,I think he meant it as more of a metaphor.
913,9,17,88,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05727225064874738,557,I usually regret dessert.
913,6,23,85,114,1.3070175438596492,0.053050395936298185,557,"On second thought, better make that To Go."
913,9,17,88,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05727225064874738,557,"Actually, I'm more concerned about the gluten."
913,9,17,88,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05727225064874738,557,Please tell me that's cherry.
913,5,25,84,114,1.3070175438596492,0.051566356414556015,557,Wait. What day does he invent ice cream?
913,8,19,87,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05590040517964037,557,"I might be naked, but I'm not that easy."
913,7,21,86,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05449403549126256,557,"Is there any ice cream, or is that, ""forbidden"" too?"
913,8,19,87,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05590040517964037,557,"Oh, darling. You shouldn't have."
913,8,19,87,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05590040517964037,557,But how can it be your mother's recipe?
913,5,25,84,114,1.3070175438596492,0.051566356414556015,557,"You first, Eve."
913,8,19,87,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05590040517964037,557,Maybe we should stick to lower-hanging fruit.
913,10,15,89,114,1.3070175438596492,0.058611996122789785,557,I am concerned about just desserts.
913,7,21,86,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05449403549126256,557,You have an oven?
913,9,17,88,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05727225064874738,557,But first you made an oven?
913,10,15,89,114,1.3070175438596492,0.058611996122789785,557,"And on the nineteenth day, God finally bought us a stove."
913,9,17,88,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05727225064874738,557,You know you had me at the apple.
913,8,19,87,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05590040517964037,557,You say it's made with alternative fruits?
913,7,21,86,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05449403549126256,557,Any forbidden dairy to go with that?
913,9,17,88,114,1.3070175438596492,0.05727225064874738,557,"Thanks. But if this is Paradise, where's the vanilla ice cream?"
935,5,24,82,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05244675595422152,557,He didn't say anything about pie.
935,11,12,88,111,1.3063063063063063,0.06110207192004746,557,How do you like them apples?
935,9,16,86,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05835977094987886,557,That smells sinful.
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,That doesn't smell like blueberry ...
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,That certainly looks tempting...
935,5,24,82,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05244675595422152,557,"Well, let's hope there's a pie exception to this whole 'forbidden fruit' thing."
935,7,20,84,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05548209204528969,557,"If it were just forbidden fruit and not all that gluten, I'd definitely go for it."
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,They didn't have cherry?
935,10,14,87,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05974665705395147,557,Let me guess. You used the original cinnamon.
935,5,24,82,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05244675595422152,557,I don't think baking it into a pie will change his mind.
935,9,16,86,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05835977094987886,557,I'm pretty sure this violates apple's terms and conditions.
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,"Oh, God! Please tell me it's blueberry!"
935,9,16,86,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05835977094987886,557,"Oh, I'll eat it all right, but just where have you been keeping it warm?"
935,9,16,86,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05835977094987886,557,"It took me 3.14 hours to make this. Now, what shall we call it?"
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,"Well, strictly speaking, it no longer is 'an apple', is it?"
935,7,20,84,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05548209204528969,557,Wouldn't this occasion call for devils food cake ?
935,10,14,87,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05974665705395147,557,What Sin It?
935,4,26,81,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05086120374432271,557,"Being a strict constructionist, I don't believe He said anything about pies."
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,Are all the ingredients locally-sourced?
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,I'm sensing the eve of destruction.
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,Shouldn't we just stick with pepperoni pizza like He told us?
935,10,14,87,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05974665705395147,557,I'm more of a cake man
935,9,16,86,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05835977094987886,557,I don't remember HIM saying anything about pie.
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,And do I smell a hint of original cinnamon?
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,But it smells like apple pie.
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,But we don't have an oven
935,10,14,87,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05974665705395147,557,I sure hope that's peach.
935,7,20,84,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05548209204528969,557,Should we take it to go?
935,4,26,81,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05086120374432271,557,Now I feel guilty no matter what I do.
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,"That's not what I thought you meant by, ""Hey, I have one in the oven."""
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,"I am fine with the sin, but not the gluten."
935,9,16,86,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05835977094987886,557,I hope the apples were locally sourced.
935,5,24,82,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05244675595422152,557,"Um, I guess that makes it okay..."
935,4,26,81,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05086120374432271,557,So the pie is a metaphor?
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,You have really evolved!
935,7,20,84,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05548209204528969,557,We're so outta here.
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,"Nice try, but I don't think baking it into a pie is gonna get us out of this one."
935,6,22,83,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05398576084415069,557,"Well, when you put it that way..."
935,13,8,90,111,1.3063063063063063,0.06372647425146774,557,"""You were warned. You were given an explanation. Yet, you persisted""."
935,8,18,85,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05693911398610064,557,"Whoa! Back up a little. First of all, what's an ""oven?"""
935,10,14,87,111,1.3063063063063063,0.05974665705395147,557,Does it still count if they're cooked?
976,9,14,83,106,1.3018867924528301,0.060203027747787304,557,"First ribs, now pie?!"
977,8,17,85,110,1.3,0.05710561159579481,557,Is this an alternative truth?
977,9,15,86,110,1.3,0.05854789959616486,557,"No way that came from apples, next you'll tell me that we came from monkeys."
977,8,17,85,110,1.3,0.05710561159579481,557,Maybe if we just eat the crust?
977,7,19,84,110,1.3,0.055625940031040794,557,Smells sinfully good!
977,8,17,85,110,1.3,0.05710561159579481,557,"Ooooh, that smells sinful!"
977,10,13,87,110,1.3,0.05995550198701891,557,"When you said I could get some of your forbidden pie, I misunderstood."
977,6,21,83,110,1.3,0.054105817921403974,557,"Okay, so... a talking snake assured you this is gluten-free?"
977,4,25,81,110,1.3,0.05092963960365776,557,Eating your apple pie could get us deported.
977,4,25,81,110,1.3,0.05092963960365776,557,"It's tempting, but I really shouldn't."
986,10,13,88,111,1.2972972972972974,0.059474348519279525,557,Apple pie served by a spare rib! What did I do to deserve this?
987,9,14,85,108,1.2962962962962963,0.059213810886178525,557,"But Eve, don't you remember God forbade us to eat gluten?"
987,7,18,83,108,1.2962962962962963,0.056215076862063375,557,Mmm ... do I smell original cinnamon?
987,7,18,83,108,1.2962962962962963,0.056215076862063375,557,"I don't know how you did that, but it looks like one hell of a temptation."
987,7,18,83,108,1.2962962962962963,0.056215076862063375,557,That's weird; I suddenly feel like eating a hot dog and watching a baseball game.
987,6,20,82,108,1.2962962962962963,0.05465404468179352,557,It is my cheat day.
987,10,12,86,108,1.2962962962962963,0.06065761012595472,557,Pie. Do I even like pie?

1513,4,18,78,100,1.26,0.05245488682206027,557,Wow. You must really think I'm an idiot.

1513,6,14,80,100,1.26,0.05617433182117573,557,So that's what happened to the leftover forbidden fruit.
1513,5,16,79,100,1.26,0.054346438278284205,557,I'm really sorry. I guess you still don't get it. I'm with Steve.
1513,3,20,77,100,1.26,0.050492523699008654,557,"Well, it's sure tempting."

1513,6,14,80,100,1.26,0.05617433182117573,557,You're sure it's blueberry.
1513,7,12,81,100,1.26,0.057944592134001244,557,Didn't he say gluten was a no-no?
1513,4,18,78,100,1.26,0.05245488682206027,557,No thanks. I just started the Paleo diet.
1513,7,12,81,100,1.26,0.057944592134001244,557,God forbid you have dessert just once.

1513,6,14,80,100,1.26,0.05617433182117573,557,I will not eat it from your hand. I will not eat if from a pan.

1513,7,12,81,100,1.26,0.057944592134001244,557,"Sure, I'll have some. What is the harm from just a slice?"

1513,5,16,79,100,1.26,0.054346438278284205,557,Uhhh...you had me at the apple.
1513,5,16,79,100,1.26,0.054346438278284205,557,So God didn't say if we ate the fruit we will die? He really said please enjoy a pie?

1513,4,18,78,100,1.26,0.05245488682206027,557,That looks sinfully delicious!
1513,4,18,78,100,1.26,0.05245488682206027,557,Wow! That looks sinfully delicious!

1513,4,18,78,100,1.26,0.05245488682206027,557,Still can't. I'm knowledge-intolerant.
1513,2,22,76,100,1.26,0.04845074558223793,557,"If God gives you apples, make apple pie."

2088,3,17,77,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05028525988543606,557,"If you're going to tempt me with it anyway, make it alamode."
2088,7,9,81,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05820407108575367,557,You baked all the knowledge out!
2088,6,11,80,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05632883150441754,557,"Yeah, I'd love to try it but when did we get an oven?"
2088,3,17,77,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05028525988543606,557,"And you're telling me the snake gave you the recipe, too?"
2088,4,15,78,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05237732328067415,557,Is this your idea of foreplay?!?
2088,6,11,80,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05632883150441754,557,So you have fire now?
2088,5,13,79,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05438897522798766,557,"Pie? God, I really shouldn't."
2088,3,17,77,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05028525988543606,557,"Well, maybe just one little slice"
2088,6,11,80,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05632883150441754,557,"It's tempting, but I distinctly remember ordering blueberry."
2088,2,19,76,97,1.2371134020618557,0.048102294430135445,557,"Now, that's better. I'm glad you finally stopped trying to make me eat those darn apples!"
2088,8,7,82,97,1.2371134020618557,0.06002075077219438,557,It looks like the next best thing to paradise.
2088,4,15,78,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05237732328067415,557,"All this, and you bake too?"
2088,4,15,78,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05237732328067415,557,So you're sure this is blueberry.
2088,3,17,77,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05028525988543606,557,I don't know...seems half-baked.
2088,4,15,78,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05237732328067415,557,Just think of it as alternative apple!
2088,4,15,78,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05237732328067415,557,That's a pie to die for!
2088,8,7,82,97,1.2371134020618557,0.06002075077219438,557,"That is really not the pie I had in mind, Eve."
2088,4,15,78,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05237732328067415,557,So the snake gave you the recipe?
2088,6,11,80,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05632883150441754,557,"Tempting, but I thought we were Paleo."
2088,5,13,79,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05438897522798766,557,"Pssst! Go ahead and eat it, what harm can it do?"
2088,5,13,79,97,1.2371134020618557,0.05438897522798766,557,"Where the hell did you find an apple corer, a peeler, a knife, a cutting board, and an oven?"
2113,3,16,75,94,1.2340425531914894,0.051126705741835796,557,"Well, you're right. He didn't say ""you shall not eat the PIE baked from the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge."""
2113,4,14,76,94,1.2340425531914894,0.053317170212019274,557,It won't work--he's mad as hell.
2113,5,12,77,94,1.2340425531914894,0.05542112628612492,557,What happened to Steve?
2113,5,12,77,94,1.2340425531914894,0.05542112628612492,557,"Well, I say it's rhubarb and I say to Hell with it!"
2113,7,8,79,94,1.2340425531914894,0.059405912480433684,557,Let me guess: Bannon gave you the recipe?
2113,4,14,76,94,1.2340425531914894,0.053317170212019274,557,Am I going to be naked after I eat this?
2113,5,12,77,94,1.2340425531914894,0.05542112628612492,557,For the hundredth time. I need Pants. Not Pie. PANTS.
2120,6,9,75,90,1.2333333333333334,0.059229341178418174,557,How on Earth did a snake bake a pie without arms? Or an oven!?
2121,6,9,76,91,1.2307692307692308,0.058630947911258176,557,"Let me guess, apple again?"
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Apple pie? I'm tempted
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,We were supposed to bring the appetizer!
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,Maybe you should have the first bite.
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,This is a little off-script but sure I'll have a taste.
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,Eve's original sin-sational apple pie.
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,Where did you get the knowledge to bake an apple pie?
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,Four and Twenty blackbirds? I suppose this was the snake's idea?
2122,7,7,79,93,1.2258064516129032,0.059468253535842175,557,"But He said, ""Of the apple, though shalt not heat."""
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,It's creative...but I bet it'll still count against us.
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"God, that pie smells delicious."
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,Is that my mom's recipe?
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,"You do know I'm on the paleo diet, right?"
2122,1,19,73,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04619468188464644,557,...and you're sure he said it was fine to eat if you baked it first?
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,"It's the ""Original Sin-o-man"" pie!"
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,And here I thought my spare ribs were awesome!
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,"Well, my trainer did say I get one cheat day..."
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,Original cinnamon?
2122,7,7,79,93,1.2258064516129032,0.059468253535842175,557,Is that Adam's apple pie?
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"Ok, if you want to see other people that much, I'll take a bite of that damn apple."
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,I'm pretty sure it's forbidden in any form.
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,"Who said, if we eat it standing up it doesn't count?"
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,I don't know yet if it's good or bad.
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"Look, as long as we're sinning...'go big or go home' I say."
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,"We don't have any clothes, so you bought an oven."
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,So that's the REAL reason he didn't want us to eat the apple.
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"No, sweetie I said ""Snake nearby! NOT Bake me a pie!"""
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,Are you suggesting motherhood is next?

2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"The calories don't count until we're kicked out of the garden, right?"
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"Wow, who taught you how to bake?"
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,Let me guess—rhubarb!
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,"OK, maybe just one bite!"
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,I hope that's a peach pie.
2122,7,7,79,93,1.2258064516129032,0.059468253535842175,557,Must have been created on day 3.14!
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Apple and original cinnamon?
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,"Hmm, He didn't say anything about pies."
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,Dessert? Didn't my ribs fill you up?
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,Not another test!
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,The serpeant promised ala mode.
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,"It smells good, but I have a bad feeling about it."
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,It's from our new neighbors.
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,A la mode would make this a much easier decision.
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,Taste this and go put on a pair of pants.
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,"Well, who can't resist pie?"
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"The Cooking Channel, the root of all evil."
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,It seems more American than Sinful
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,Would you eat them in a pie? Would you with a snake?
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,Eve--that looks sinfully delicious!
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,"If I try a slice, will you quit nagging me about that stupid tree?"
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,"Please, God ... tell me it's blueberry."
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,You're sure this will get us out of our timeshare?
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,"To be honest, I had something totally different in mind when you said, ""Come and get it!"""
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,"An oven, you found an oven. And a pie plate. What kind of pie is that? Oh, God."
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,"Cherry, I hope."
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,"Well, it is cheat day..."
2122,6,9,78,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05746928821472055,557,"Tempting, but I'm gluten free."
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,"I may not know good and evil, but I know fat calories when I see them."
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,"Wow, a pie! Where'd you get the apples?"
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,Are you trying to tempt me or something?
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,"Well, for starters, I'm...naked. And afraid."
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Forbidden Fruit Pie! My favorite!
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,You make a compelling case.
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,I was hoping for banana cream.
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,"Um...you know, I don't think God will be fooled."
2122,1,19,73,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04619468188464644,557,Thanks a lot. Now I have to invent ice cream.
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,"You've got the apple pie, now can we work on motherhood?"
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,Can I just pick at the crust?
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,Is there sinamon in it?
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Who's recipe?
2122,2,17,74,93,1.2258064516129032,0.04865904566594242,557,"Don't tell me, let me guess...Apple?"
2122,3,15,75,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05100447838981256,557,And you thought the apples were tempting.
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Throw it in my face and hope He just laughs.
2122,5,11,77,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05539824001906587,557,Don't worry - it's fine! These are 'alternative apples!'
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,You're telling me this is my mother's recipe?
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Are you sure this doesn't count?
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Make it à la mode and you have yourself a deal.
2122,4,13,76,93,1.2258064516129032,0.05324669855036501,557,Why do I suddenly know the number 3.14159265359. . .?

2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"uh, 3.14159..."
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,"You didn't put raisins in it, did you?"
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,Let's taste one of the apples first. You never know.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,A little known fact - the oven was invented before clothing.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Technically it is a pie now and not an apple.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,I hope it's blueberry.
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,"Uh thanks, but apple?"
2633,0,19,71,90,1.211111111111111,0.04325820177821489,557,I feel like someone is watching us.

2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,It's tempting but something tells me I should take a pass.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,There may be an aftertaste.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Another Sinterest recipe?
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,And it was good.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Baking it isn't going to help.
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,"Oh, hell....I give up."
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,Your first clue something was wrong should have been when the snake said it was a recipe for a pie like grandma used to make.
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,"He's okay with the apples, but said the soggy crust is unforgivable."
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,I see what you did there.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,I sense that you two are cooking something up against me.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,No thanks. I’m on the paleo diet.
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,He's asking whether you tasted any of those apples before you baked them!
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,That looks totally sinful.
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,I don't suppose that's a cherry pie?
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"No matter how you sugar coat it, this will not end well"
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,Just a quick nosh … what could it hurt?
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,"Wait, where did you get the knowledge to bake?"
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Goddamn that looks good.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,What's rhubarb?
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,Another half-baked alternative fact?
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,"Um, I just got a call. We're moving."
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,...but I asked God to make me a tart?
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,"Personally, I would have gone with a lattice crust."
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,How did you figure out how to make it?
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Your pie looks delicious as sin!!
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,Since they were on the ground .... I think they will be OK.
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,it doesn't count if it's baked.
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,You said the apples are locally sourced?
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Bake. Snake. I feel a song comin' on.
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,This is for the ribs.

2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,"No thanks, Eve. I'm paleo."
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Are you sure there are no apples in the pie?
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,We'll have to wrap it to go.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Mom?
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,"Since it's apple, I suppose just a piece."
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,"I mean, I guess it's vegan, so it's gotta be okay..."
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,He was really mad this time. I think it's going to take more than just a pie.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Apple again Eve?
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"For God's sake, tell me that's rhubarb."
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,"Oh wait, does that have gluten?"
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,I love how you make knowledge so irresistible...
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Baked into a cobbler? Will this paradise ever end?
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,Whoa…bad timing…I just started the Garden of Eden Beach Diet.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Please tell me that's strawberry-rhubarb.
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,"That's awfully nice, but just an apple would have been enough."
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Who's recipe did you use?
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,God says we have eat our broccoli first.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,So good it's sinful.
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,And you swear it's gluten-free?
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,I thought pie are square.
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,Don't tempt me - I'm on the Paleo Diet.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"I must say Eve, your baked goods are very tempting."
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,Please tell me it's not apple.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Let's do it again before He responds.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Pumpkin? Pecan?
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,"Dammit, where are Ben and Jerry when you need them?!"
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Kinda hoping that's not apple
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"If you're going to mess up humanity forever, it might as well be apple PIE."
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Did that snake just spit on my head?
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,I'm not sure cooking the apples makes it any better
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,"Let me get this straight, you've found an alternative fact for avoiding eternal sin?"
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Actually I wanted a pizza pie.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,It sure smells like apple to me?
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"If I eat only the crust, will we still get kicked out of the garden?"
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"Wish I could, but I'm on the Paleo."
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,You couldn't have used my mother's recipe.
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,"I have this sudden, overwhelming desire to call you ""Mom""."
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,I forget. Was it cherries or apples we are forbidden to eat?
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,Bye bye Mesoamerican pie...
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,Please be blueberry.
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,But it's still apple!
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Uhh... not sure covering the apples is gonna fool him.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"Babe, I thought we agreed on this paleo diet thing."
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,Something is telling me it's apple...
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Where'd you get the peaches?
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,I can't. My snake has me on a paleo diet.
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,But are you absolutely certain they're organic?
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,Is it gluten-free?
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,"Well it really smells great, but I'm doing this paleo thing right now..."
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,"Oh wow, an Eve ORIGINAL CINammon apple pie!"
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,And Mankind was spared a fall because Adam and Eve were totally off gluten that week.
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,"For God's sake, I asked for an angel food cake!"
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,Tempting but I'm doing a gluten-free thing now.
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,You say it's an old family recipe.
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,I would be more tempted with a scoop of ice cream on the side.
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,Is it still a sin if its baked?
2633,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,557,So that's what you did with my apple!
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,"As long as it's American, it must be OK."
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,Please tell me its a cheery pie
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,So you don't think it counts if the apples have been cooked?
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,I thought we were having ribs?
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,Still Life of Pie
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,Is it apple? Cuz...
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,"First it was apple sauce, then apple strudel. When will you give up?"
2633,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,557,"Tempting, but I'm on the paleo diet, babe."
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,I only eat Paleo.
2633,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,557,I think we're gonna need a to-go box.
2633,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,557,Apple pie? How tempting!
2633,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,557,Are you sure it's okay to eat dessert first?
2633,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,557,So you're saying it's not apples. It's an alternative fact called a pie?

2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Is that paleo?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"So, you say it's from The Garden of Eatin'?"
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Gosh, I don't know. I just started that paleo diet."
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Is the forbidden fruit organic?
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,Betty who?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Umm... let's keep this pie off the record.
2827,7,4,77,88,1.2045454545454546,0.060817942061245564,557,I am really tired of this snake referring to itself in the third person.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"For heaven's sake Gloria, didn't that one bite cause enough trouble!"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Apple pie? I'm confused...does this make you wholesome or wicked?
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,"It smells great, but you know carbs are forbidden."
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,Oh darn! He told me we can't heat the forbidden fruit.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,Your mother's recipe?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"So, it shall bring onto this World woe, sin, and her shadow Death, but, boy, pie is worth it."
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,Don't worry...It isn't apple.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I know the serpent says forget about the carbs but...
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,I'll see you in hell.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Yes, I am a locavore."
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Trust me, it's peach."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,I guess I just interpreted things differently.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,I like the new take on date night
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,I really don't think THE MAN is going to appreciate your creativity.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,That snake is really persuasive!
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"I think I'd like the snake to taste it first, if you don't mind"
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Well, as long as they're organic it's probably ok"
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,I hid the evidence.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Gee, I hope that's not apple."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Something so American can't be sinful, right?"
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,"Blueberry? Pumpkin? Peach?...Oh, just tell me!"
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Wait a second... What kind of pie is that?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,It's not the apple. I'm off gluten.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Apple pie? And where is America
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,No thanks. I'm gluten-free.
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,"Think whipped cream is forbidden, too?"
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Yeah, maybe, Eve...He didn't actually SAY baked fruit ..."
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Do you promise it's Kosher?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"So, you're saying it's in the spirit if not the letter?"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I think you're right. He didn't say anything about forbidden fruit filling. Let's eat!
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,This is not how we are supposed to sin.
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,Another one of your half-baked ideas?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Why not? We sure liked what Serpent taught us about grapes.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Are you sure it's rhubarb?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Are your ingredients locally sourced?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I still think this is a half baked idea.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,Forbidden Fruits of the Forest pie sounds good to me!
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I thought it was gonna be a piece of cake.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,I didn't know we had an Oven of Knowledge.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"This is the mock-apple pie made with Ritz crackers, isn't it?"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I'm sure I said pumpkin.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Love how it makes the whole firmament smell good.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,I always thought it would be hot and steamy.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Adam was reluctant to eat the forbidden fruit pie…partly for fear of banishment from the Garden of Eden and partly for the three hundred calories per slice.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"""I still don't understand what you mean by alternative facts.'"
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,I'm gluten free. Do you have just a plain apple?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Gosh. For goodness sake...you shouldn't have.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I'll guess apple!
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,I hope that's a cherry pie.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,It's better than a cigarette.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"...but without a dab of French Vanilla and no digestif, no vermouth, it just feels wrong..."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Don't tell me. It's apple.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Well, there's no shame in pie."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Is it ethically sourced?
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"Asp, and you shall receive."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,We're cooked now!
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,WOW! This will make you famous for a long time.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Are we expecting company?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Original sinfully delicious
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,That looks to die for!
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Pretty sure He recommended humble pie. This smells like Knowledge.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Well, if you're sure it's MOCK apple pie."
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"It’s tempting, but sugar tops my list of forbidden foods."
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,He had me at ribs.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,You didn't bite the apple?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Are the apples in there locally grown?
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,Try the pie. It;s to die for.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"Wow, a homemade pie. Next, you'll be sewing your own clothes!"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Dessert first?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"No, I think the apples are fine, its the gluten I'm worried about."
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Adam never had a chance against Eve's temptations.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Why not, technically it's not an apple."
2827,7,4,77,88,1.2045454545454546,0.060817942061245564,557,I got the idea from Food Network...and Satan.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Don't tell me. It's apple.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Too many more of these and I might start feeling ashamed to be naked.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Sugar-free or not, it just feels wrong."
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Please tell me that's not locally sourced.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,And then I'm supposed to say we found it?
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,I can't be tempted unless its gluten-free.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Well, this better be good."
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,But how did you bake it?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Tell me it's persimmons.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Don't you think blueberry might be better?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"In the interest of full disclosure, I took a small bite out of one before you made the pie......"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Oh, sorry honey. Snake and I grabbed a bite on the way home."
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,So it's made with saltines and just tastes like apples?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,It smells like my tree of the knowledge of good and evil scented body wash.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"It's ok, it's cherry."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,You know what would be really nice? You learning to dress like a woman.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Adam's apple
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Where did you find an oven in this place?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Apple, plus sugar and fat. This will send us straight to hell."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Is that store-bought?
2827,0,18,70,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04324570426746518,557,So this is really MOCK apple pie?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"I'm ready for a piece, all right ..."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,I'd be tempted if it were A La Mode.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,It's totally worth it.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I was expecting to meet someone named Eve -- not Martha.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,How would we know whether it is good or bad?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Eat it? Wow, I totally misunderstood."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,I'm confused........ your mother's recipe?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Eve, your apple pie is tempting, but it's still forbidden."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"First ribs, now apple pie. What's next?"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,My favorite! How did you know?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"What do you mean, ""You'll know it when I try it?"""
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Wait. What ARE Alternative Apples?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,'Please tell me that's not what I think it is'
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I think someone's trying to tempt us.
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,You used our last apple to make a pie?
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,Four and twenty blackbirds? That's not quite what I was expecting.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,A tempting dessert?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Do you have knowledge of the word 'no'?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,You sure you were allowed to use that pan?!
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,That's a helluva pie.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Oh, Eve, the calories alone are sinful."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,It's knowledge-flavored.
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,"That's a chicken pot pie, right?"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Eve, you made my favorite...Apple SINamon Pie!"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I keep hearing a voice telling me to shun the apples and stay on my diet.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"Oh Dear, you baked the original sin!"
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Fresh baked from the kosher deli - what could go wrong?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,You're sure it's a cherry pie?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Apple, again?"
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"What, dessert before the ribs?"
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"I get what you're saying, honey, but we're still violating the [ital] spirit [/ital] of the law."
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,"Sorry, I’m gluten free. Now if you had just a plain old apple, I'd bite that…."
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,You want me to stick my WHAT into that?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"No, I don’t want to be your taste tester."
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"Look Adam, this isn't the forbidden fruit. It's an alternative fact."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Oh, please tell me that's a cherry pie..."
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Original sin, or original recipe?"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Now it's just a peach pie...right?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,You couldn't pick the blueberry of knowledge?
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Swear to God its Mock Apple?
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,"Sorry babe, I'm doing Paleo."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Does that make us Americans now?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Hmm..er...Has God created vanilla ice-cream yet?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,I take it back; it was totally worth it.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Is it home made?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,That looks sinfully good.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,That smells positively sinful!
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Devil's food only in cake, right?"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,So you're pretty sure that in a pie it's not that big of a deal?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,He didn't mention anything about apple pie.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Do you think it's still forbidden if it's baked?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,I guess I would be anti-American not to eat it.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"So, let me get this straight...the 'alternative fact' version will be more digestible?"
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Tell your mother thank you but I am in enough trouble already.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Thats the fake kind made with Ritz crackers, right?"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"OMG, wasn't motherhood supposed to come first?"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Did you sell our clothes to buy an oven?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Where the hell did you bake that?
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"No thanks, I've got a restrictive deity."
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,So Trump says this is Cherry Pie?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"When Adam didn't fall for the apple, Eve tried a different ploy."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Smells delicious. Where did you get the apples?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Hey, wait a minute. Isn't this form over substance?"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Right, apple pie is not an apple; we should be fine."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Ok, you can bake a pie. How are you at doing the laundry?"
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"Holy goodbye paradise, Eve! Please, tell me that's blueberry!!"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Let's see. Defy God...Invent fire... What's next?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,We'll need bigger fig leaves after that!
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Wow, thank you Eve! That looks sinful!"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Wow, this is really going to mess with exegesis in a couple of millennia."
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"Though he thought the idea half-baked, Adam ate, hoping to avoid the torment of hearing about that infernal pie for eternity."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"It's not the fruit that worries me, it's the gluten."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Something tells me I'll regret this.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,You made that from scratch?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"'Alternative apples,' huh?"
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,It's not what you're thinking. It's strawberry rhubarb.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,He didn't say anything about forbidden fruit pie!
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,I'm into Paleo now. How about if we just eat some apples.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,So now you're cooking with alternative facts?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Goodbye missionary position!
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,So you're saying it's only mock apple.
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,God only knows how you baked that pie!
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"When you said, ""would like some pie?"" I had something totally different in mind."
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,This feels naughty.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Angel food pie? You sure about that?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"When you're done, find something to wear"
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"It's Mom's Apple Pie, what could go wrong?"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"""Wow, Honey, you can cook, too!"
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Why settle for a bite of the apple when you can have the entire pie ?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Oh thanks so much, but, really, an apple would have been just fine."
2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,Are you sure it doesn't count if they're baked?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Has anyone ever called you an overachiever?
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Refined sugar -- that will go down as the original sin.
2827,6,6,76,88,1.2045454545454546,0.058630956471059835,557,You made that from scratch?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Hey serpent, are you sure this doesn't count?"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I still think we're going to get in trouble.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Can I have it a la mode?
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,You didn't have to go to all that trouble. An apple would've been just fine.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,I still think we're not supposed to eat it.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I'd rather have a date.
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,From your mouth to God's ire.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Not apple I hope
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,"I don't know, Eve. We could be playing with fire."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Apple pie will be the downfall of my diet and what else?
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"I just can't. I 'm against that silly rule, too. But if we get caught gaming the system, we're gonna lose everything."
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,Is there any bacon in it?
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,I suppose a little slice couldn't hurt.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,The critics will kill us. They didn't have ovens back then.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,Please tell me you used the leftover figs!
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Quit tempting me, Eve! You know I can't keep my hands off apple pie."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Let me guess... apple pie? Eve, enough with the apples already. Seriously."
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Humble pie? How tempting.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,God's gonna be pissed that you took that off his windowsill.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"He said ""a pie is OK?"""

2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,I hope you didn't bake out ALL the sin.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I'll just have an apple. I'm off carbs.

2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,I always get in trouble with desserts.
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Apple? Tempting, but I'll pass."
2827,2,14,72,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04891479303131595,557,"Hmm, that's makes them even more tempting."

2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,"Add a scoop of ice cream, then I'll be tempted!"
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,"Since it's already baked into the pie, . . ."
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,"You'll have to tell me, because my mind is kind of a blank slate right now"
2827,5,8,75,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05635916994471799,557,Looks good! Or maybe evil.
2827,3,12,73,88,1.2045454545454546,0.05151591984183321,557,Think He'll notice?

2827,1,16,71,88,1.2045454545454546,0.04616734730784048,557,"Sure, a piece of pie never hurt anyone…"
2827,4,10,74,88,1.2045454545454546,0.053991879176445545,557,I think I'd rather have the blueberry.

3618,3,9,72,84,1.1785714285714286,0.051262641097241254,557,So you just all of a sudden knew how to make a pie?

3618,3,9,72,84,1.1785714285714286,0.051262641097241254,557,"Well, I guess so...your grandmother's recipe, you say?"
3618,1,13,70,84,1.1785714285714286,0.04532256509703348,557,"So, in a pie, we're okay?"
3618,2,11,71,84,1.1785714285714286,0.048383846887362136,557,It's called pie. Apparently it's sinfully delicious.
3618,3,9,72,84,1.1785714285714286,0.051262641097241254,557,"Seriously Adam... it's an organic, sugar and fat reduced pie made with non GMO fair trade apples in a union bakery. What could be wrong with that?"
3618,2,11,71,84,1.1785714285714286,0.048383846887362136,557,Hmm. Not sure that's on the Paleo diet.
3618,3,9,72,84,1.1785714285714286,0.051262641097241254,557,Maybe just a sliver?

3618,1,13,70,84,1.1785714285714286,0.04532256509703348,557,Is that blueberry or apple?

4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,And here I thought the neighbors didn't approve of our nudist ways.
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,The Gluten of Eden
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,I'm gluten-free. Maybe just an apple?
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,I don't know. My Dad says I'm alergic.
4362,0,13,68,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04103893861381398,557,I'll bet that would go great with ice cream!

4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,I'd actually prefer strawberry-rhubarb.
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,And you promise it's gluten free?
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,IT LOOKS VERY TEMPTING....BUT DOES IT CONTAIN ANY NUTS???
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,"You promise it's blueberry, right?"

4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,Is it my Father's recipe?
4362,4,5,72,81,1.1604938271604939,0.054025571572940904,557,"If we are getting thrown out of here for this, at least you could have thrown on some vanilla ice cream!"
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,My Mother always made it with a lattice crust.
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,An apple pie?
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,I hope the boys don't fight over it.
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,I agree ... adding the cinnamon makes it smell so sinful!
4362,0,13,68,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04103893861381398,557,"It's been to hell and back, so you're safe."
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,"Now we've got to work on the ""mom"" part."

4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,"I guess if it is cooked, it might be OK to eat."
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,No worries. It's a CHERRY pie!

4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,This is going a little too quickly for me.
4362,4,5,72,81,1.1604938271604939,0.054025571572940904,557,Please don't tell me you made that with forbidden fruit.
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,"Trust me, God didn't say anything about apple pie."

4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,I forgot the ice cream.
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,But are the apples organic?
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,He said no gluten.

4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,That look absolutely sinful; I'm tempted to eat the whole thing.
4362,0,13,68,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04103893861381398,557,Thanks but I already had an apple.

4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,Um... I prefer cherry.
4362,4,5,72,81,1.1604938271604939,0.054025571572940904,557,"Honey, that better not be an apple pie."
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,Clever Eve; but why don't we just avoid apple to be on the safe side?
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,Holy mackerel! Just like my mom used to bake!

4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,This decision is not as easy as pie
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,Will we feel any less shame because you baked it?
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,"Remember that big, old, apple? Voila."
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,Who can turn down homemade?
4362,4,5,72,81,1.1604938271604939,0.054025571572940904,557,Someday that will represent all that used to be good.
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,"Smells heavenly, but I'm off gluten."
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,If that won't make him come down we're getting a dog.
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,"Once again, I simply don't care for apples."
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,I thought we were on the Raw Food Diet?
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,I hope it's not rhubarb again.
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,And on the eighth day God created Dutch apple.
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,Maybe we should have peach pie.
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,I'm off carbs.
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,That better be a blue berry pie!
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,Peach?! I was hoping for apple.
4362,4,5,72,81,1.1604938271604939,0.054025571572940904,557,But...gluten is forbidden!
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,Is that Kosher?
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,Is that same fruit in it?
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,"First the apple, then the pie, what's next, ice cream?"
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,"It's vegan, fat-free, gluten-free, soy-free, antibiotics-free, low carb, non GMO and 100% organic. I promise."
4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,Again?
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,I guess it's okay if it's alternative fruit.
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,I'm more of a peach cobbler kind of guy.
4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,"I'm glad you can cook, I'm going to be a plumber."

4362,1,11,69,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04464119686855444,557,Maybe we need to slow down a little.
4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,"Yum, hot apple pie; where's the ice cream."

4362,2,9,70,81,1.1604938271604939,0.04797372648821098,557,I guess a little gluten won't hurt.
4362,4,5,72,81,1.1604938271604939,0.054025571572940904,557,Let me guess--the recipe comes with Ten Commandments.

4362,3,7,71,81,1.1604938271604939,0.05108933752236682,557,And you're sure we can eat it now that it's prepared this way?

4815,4,3,71,78,1.141025641025641,0.05390004122146829,557,So what am I supposed to eat it with?
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,"Let me guess...apple, from the ...you know."
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,Tempting . . . but is it gluten free?

4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,Now I know why it's called the Garden of Eatin'
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,What happened to me eating more fresh fruit?
4815,0,11,67,78,1.141025641025641,0.039663750600197265,557,Should I thank you for the pie of knowledge of good and evil?
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,Is this the Garden of Eden or Eatin'?
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,"I mean, I really feel like it does have gluten."
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,"Eve, is this another one of your half-baked ideas again?"
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,Processed food? Aren't we going to be expelled for that?!
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,Did you use my mom's recipe?

4815,4,3,71,78,1.141025641025641,0.05390004122146829,557,I hope that's gluten free.
4815,3,5,70,78,1.141025641025641,0.05071700021369214,557,"Yeah sure, you made a pie. But, did you hear? Saturday Night Live has the highest ratings ever; more than Trump ever made on the Apprentice!"
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,"If the knowledge is 'cooked', we might get away with it.."

4815,3,5,70,78,1.141025641025641,0.05071700021369214,557,I am on a diet. I just rather have an apple.
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,On second thought I think I really should stick to my diet
4815,0,11,67,78,1.141025641025641,0.039663750600197265,557,When life gives you apples...
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,But I asked for a la mode
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,"Eve, that is one weird looking pizza ... it could be a trick!"
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,You baked what kind of pie?
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,"Gluten-free, really?"
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,"Wait, did He say eat of the fruit of the Garden, or did He say bake it?"
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,Is that Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil Pie?
4815,0,11,67,78,1.141025641025641,0.039663750600197265,557,"Technically, He didn’t say anything about the OVEN in the middle of the garden."
4815,3,5,70,78,1.141025641025641,0.05071700021369214,557,I can't remember if he forbade apples or gluten.
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,So this is how you got your half-baked idea of eating the apple.
4815,3,5,70,78,1.141025641025641,0.05071700021369214,557,I can't keep up with the pace of technology.
4815,0,11,67,78,1.141025641025641,0.039663750600197265,557,He never said anything about an Apple Pie.
4815,0,11,67,78,1.141025641025641,0.039663750600197265,557,You know I can't eat apple pie without ice cream!
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,You're the apple of my pie.
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,"Oh well, in that case, it's my fault."
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,God won't mind as long as the apples are baked.
4815,3,5,70,78,1.141025641025641,0.05071700021369214,557,"If those apples came from the Tree of Knowledge, you should have made a pi..."
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,I would have been just as happy with Entenmann's.
4815,0,11,67,78,1.141025641025641,0.039663750600197265,557,It's leverage for making a deal to stay on the property and I know how to make deals.
4815,0,11,67,78,1.141025641025641,0.039663750600197265,557,"It's half-baked, Eve."
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,But isn’t this the forbidden pie?
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,It's time for some game theory
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,"It's bad, Adam. No way to sugarcoat this."

4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,Do you think it is too much since I already ate the apple?
4815,3,5,70,78,1.141025641025641,0.05071700021369214,557,Nice try. But I still prefer bananas.
4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,Someday your innovative genius may be misinterpreted.
4815,3,5,70,78,1.141025641025641,0.05071700021369214,557,Just the apple. I'm gluten intolerant.
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,Apple pie might be OK.

4815,1,9,68,78,1.141025641025641,0.04366020435906115,557,"The more complicated these apple products get, the less they appeal to me."
4815,2,7,69,78,1.141025641025641,0.047320331546548945,557,Smells fishy but the snake says it's apple.

5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,Which kitchen?
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,"Okay--you left out the apple, but you used high carbs and saturated fats."
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,"Is that gluten-free, babe?"
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,I made it from scratch
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,What crust.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,You mean to tell me this whole time I could have been eating cooked meat.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,Do you think He'll let us stay?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"Actually, I'm more of a peach guy."
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,Is this a piece offering?
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,"I see you've been watching the cooking channel again, Eve."
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,Don't worry. These apples are locally sourced.
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,OK. But what about the gluten?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"No, I was wrong. You can bake a pie"
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,You sure there's no gluten in that?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,I don't know if I should... Are you sure it's gluten free?
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,Pie seems out of character
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,He didn't say anything about fruit from the pie of good and evil.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,I hope you checked for wormholes.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,It's in a pie; so I guess it's ok.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,"I hope it's made with steevia, I can't take the guilt."
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,You know I have a gluten intolerance.
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,It's an alternative fact apple pie?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"I'm trying to keep trim, but what harm could one bite do?"
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"With a sheepish ""delicious!"" for the sour pie of eating, Adam spoketh our first lie of Eden"
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,I hope it's apple. I'm tired of pumpkin.
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,a La Mode would be more tempting.
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,It's not what I meant by pie
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"I was told by my dietitian not to eat this apple pie or there will be great consequences, but it's so tempting."
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,How could I forget? March 14th!
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,He was saying something about eternal fire and it gave me an idea.
5938,4,1,70,75,1.12,0.05355808499627735,557,"I just wanted a bite of the apple, but you baked me a whole pie."
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,The snake says the Boysenberry is sinfully good.
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,Hmmm... is it gluten free?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,Adam's déjà vu moment
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,I can't eat that. Gluten is evil.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,Where'd that come from?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,Do you know what you're doing?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,But He said no carbs.
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,Let's start again...
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,Just as long as it isn't forbidden fruit pie.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,I don't think that I like them apples.
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,But it is gluten-free?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,Now that's really hot!
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,Man's first decision. Eat it = exiled from Eden. Have sex with it = major motion picture hit in the '90s
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,pie? not fruit?
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,A 'Mock Apple Pie' made out of mock ritz crackers?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,So eating it on the Sabbath is like a catch-22?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"Nice try, but I don't do gluten"
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"Thanks, but I’m full from bananas at Steve’s."
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,"Sorry, I prefer kale."
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,Is it to go?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,Are you sure you can't think of anything better than a warm apple pie?
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,"I don't like rhubarb, do you have anything else?"
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,OMG the snake told me 3.14 and now it was apple.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,I guess one slice of forbidden fruit pie couldn't hurt.
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,It's tempting . . . but is it gluten-free?
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,A Merrick Pie--didn't it expire in November?
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,"You were in Little Italy, and forgot to play my Power Ball numbers?"
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,"Hmm, an alt-knowledge pie you say?"
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"Have you ever seen ""American Pie""?"
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,What's that?
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,Apple-Helper?
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,Gee I don't know. Is that gluten free?
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,He told you that the apples were organically grown?
5938,0,9,66,75,1.12,0.037776011264121404,557,Does this pie adhere to locavore standards?
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,I used to think all those people who called you an evil tart were wrong but now I’m not so sure.
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"Thanks no, I've gone gluten free."
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,How do I know these aren't fake apples?
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,It looks divine.
5938,2,5,68,75,1.12,0.04634379945308485,557,No thanks. I'm gluten-free.
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,I thought you were going to make a banana cream pie.
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,Did you use father's recipe?
5938,3,3,69,75,1.12,0.05008101544605609,557,Why did you cover the pie's nakedness?
5938,1,7,67,75,1.12,0.04227750450756747,557,"It appears you take great pride in that pie, but now we'll have to start a clothes budget."

6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Is it still forbidden if it's been at 350 for an hour?
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Yet another version of the same temptation?
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,The first advertiser.

6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,I like the part about acquiring wisdom. But I'm not sure about taking you shopping for clothes for the rest of our lives.
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,I suppose that's one way to get around to eating an apple
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"Well, we don't have a grandma, so this will have to do."

6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,"Sure, apple pie is tempting. But where can you go to get a good cigar around here?"
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"So no longer a fruit, technically speaking, let alone forbidden fruit?"
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Is that the apple pie of wisdom? I know someone out in DC who could really use some of that about now.
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"Despite our enduring and profound intimacy, I never suspected you had a solar oven."

6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,"Well, if you're absolutely certain it's gluten-free . . ."
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,I think He'll understand since I've gone gluten-free
6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,An American Pie ? Won't be biting into that.
6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,That's great. Maybe we can stay 'cause you made a pie.
6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,I'm sorry. I've had to give up gluten.

6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"All that knowledge, and all you come up with is a @#*!%$z pie?"
6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,So it's only seven percent eternal damnation?
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Hath it no gluten?
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,I hope it is an apple pie.
6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,"Did you ever feel you were just on the most fertile ground to drop a good ""pick-up"" line, but still might blow it?"
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Now I'm supposed to take a bite of your cream pie?
6486,2,3,66,71,1.0985915492957747,0.04554578291161663,557,"If it is strawberry, thank you. If it is apple, give it to the asp."
6486,2,3,66,71,1.0985915492957747,0.04554578291161663,557,"Geez, I don't know...I'm trying to count my apostasies this week"
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Apple pie I presume?
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"I'm sorry honey, but that's not on the Paleo diet. Did my mother give you that recipe?"
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"Trust me, it's organic and non-gmo."
6486,2,3,66,71,1.0985915492957747,0.04554578291161663,557,I say beware of pythons bearing pies.
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Are you sure it's He won't punish us on our cheat day? I still think it's a half baked idea...

6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,Trump built the wall. There is no fresh produce.

6486,2,3,66,71,1.0985915492957747,0.04554578291161663,557,That God created convection ovens before he created television kind of tempts me to do something I might regret.
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"Honey, are you sure that's gluten-free?"

6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,That better be a blue berry pie!
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"What, no fork?"
6486,2,3,66,71,1.0985915492957747,0.04554578291161663,557,Not that forbidden fruit.
6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,Hope that is apple pie

6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,"It smells real good, but did you use organic apples and full grain flower?"
6486,2,3,66,71,1.0985915492957747,0.04554578291161663,557,"umm, is this vegan AND gluten free? You know how gluten makes me bloat."
6486,0,7,64,71,1.0985915492957747,0.03563129757936204,557,It smells delicious but I don't think I can eat that all by myself.
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,I hope that's boisenberry!

6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Does that pie fit my new Paleo diet?
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"While I agree there's always room for dessert, is it really worth the shame at our nakedness?"
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Are there nuts in that?
6486,2,3,66,71,1.0985915492957747,0.04554578291161663,557,Does the president really believe we'd fall for that?

6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,Does this set a bad precedent?
6486,3,1,67,71,1.0985915492957747,0.049767789060331365,557,It's mock apple pie.
6486,1,5,65,71,1.0985915492957747,0.0408901437281722,557,"Thanks, but it's too hot to wear."

7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,Tempting...but I shouldn't - I'm off gluten.
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,You ordered in?
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,Looks tempting. But I told you I'm allergic to apples.
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,How’d that dough rise and not fall after consuming those apples?

7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,I said a good apple lie.
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,"I'm fine with the fruit, but I can't do the gluten."

7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,Fair play foreplay
7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,Does it contain gluten? Because that would be a sin.
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,At least tell me it's gluten-free.

7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,I hope it's okay; they were all out of Golden Delicious.
7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,...but does it contain gluten?

7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,I think you're right - if the apples are 100% GMO then it's probably OK....
7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,"Uh, how about . . . after?"
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,I sure hope that's not an apple pie.
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,"The apple didn't work out so well, not sure if I should have pie."

7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,If that's apple pie I think I'm going to pass.
7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,"Honey, are you sure that pie is approximately 6,000 years old?"

7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,You know I don't like pumpkin. Can we try something else?
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,Is that a Martha Stewart recipe?
7265,0,5,63,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03188665499421398,557,"I'd be tempted, but you know my gluten allergy."
7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,But where is the vanilla ice cream?
7265,1,3,64,68,1.0735294117647058,0.03815416529678503,557,I'm pretty we're in big trouble with Father if we eat this . . . But it smells so divine.
