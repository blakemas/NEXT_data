1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"Now, for the mobile gym."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,What's your brother's rollout plan?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"If I'm cookin' now, this is supper."
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"No, I love that we're a sanctuary city, but next door got Biryani."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"Hot dogs if we watch ""Independence Day,"" nachos if we watch ""Three Amigos""."
1986,3,0,37,40,1.15,0.08435273922869735,577,It's only until the MTA gets its act together.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,I feel dead inside.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,and... Happy Anniversary!
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,There may be some lingering resentment.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"If he provided sofa delivery, then it would be perfect."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,He's the man behind the arm-to-table movement.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"Yeah, but they don't deliver."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"Sorry ma'am, but I don't do popcorn."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Okay. Next time we'll read the encumbrances on the title before we build.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Don't look him in the eye.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,No tax abatement is worth this
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,You said you wanted home delivery!
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"Pink elephant? No, that's my cousin Miguel."
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,How did you expect 'couch delivery' to work?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Because Netflix doesn't sell ice cream.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,You up for room service??
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,I can't believe he asked us to make popcorn.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,It's faster delivery than Amazon Prime.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,My Dad owns 30 carts. This is the entry-level test to see if they can survive excrutiating boredom. Ignore him.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Did you ask him to take off his shoes?
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"What, again no Pomodoro? Padrino then."
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,Hotdogs for supper? Again?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I just asked for a doggie bag.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,You ruined the complete baseball experience by cleaning the bathroom.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Why do I feel guilty NOT eating junk food?
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Street to couch.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"I know you are concerned about an ICE raid, but this location is probably not financially viable for your business."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,We might have hit the point where the creepiness of geotargeting outweighs the convenience.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,You'll never convince me to put ketchup on a hot dog.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Are you ever going to cook again?
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,It lacks a human element.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Bob said we should've taken the cash payout instead of the grand prize
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"I don't know, where do *you* feel like ordering from?"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"Dad, isn't this stretching the definition of a home office?"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I did warn you about Amazon's whole food cartel thing.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"You will need to post your license, Dad."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Still nothing gluten free?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,It's a pilot program called Amazon in Home.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"Hot dog with everything, Hon... I have to watch this next play."
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,Your dad doesn't always have to bring dinner.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,Take me out to the ball game
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,The port-a-potty gets here tomorrow.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Perhaps this isn't the best corner for him.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Chili dogs again...?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I still have to get off the couch.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I'll have Netflix and chili.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Again? Down the hall on the left.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,When did Siri become a man?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,This tiny- house craze has gone too far.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,At least he's out of the attic.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Your cooking could benefit from some free market exposure.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"My dad likes to stretch my allowance, and reduce society's rate of unwanted pregnancies, all at the same time."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,did I mention it comes with a free small soda?
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,He followed me home
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,I was kinda thinking Chinese.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Does this make us streetwise or not?
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"Remind me again: is that Ben, or Jerry?"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"For a change, let's order in tonight."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Order any three items.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"At this rate, we'll eat through our profits."
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,..and you're still gonna order seamless?
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,You're completely sure your ex knows it's over?
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,There really is an app for that.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I wonder why my stomach hurts?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Lets move upstate.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"Predictable? Me? I'll have you know that tonight, I'm a ketchup man!"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"No, thanks. I ate at the office."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"Honey, I know I asked you to take care of dinner this week but..."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I still say we should eat out.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,It's just $29.95 a month...
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I feel obligated to buy something
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I know he's your brother but I can't do hotdogs again tonight.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"Being New Yorkers, its neat to have our own personal in- house Sabretts!... remember no umbrellas inside!"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,We'll have the grilled mahi mahi tacos tonight with the ginger lime dressing. And can we start with your melted seven layer nachos and two watermelon margaritas ?
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Will you come back for the ALCS?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Where will with you be when diarrhea strikes?
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,That really puts a damper on Netflix and chill.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,His food is so pedestrian.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I think I'll wait until the 7th inning
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,The world wasn't quite convenient enough.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,'The down side is that he closes at ten and we have to tow him home.'
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I don’t think that is the correct way to reach your target market.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I know--but it's rent controlled.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,It's how he pays his part of the rent.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,That explains the absence of a refrigerator and stove.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Thisreally pushes the limits of instant gratification.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,"Alexa, why do I have diabetes?"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"""The film will be starting soon. That's only a trailer""."

1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"Next commercial, 2 with relish"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I think you have gone too far with your food truck craze.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,This is taking UberEats a step too far.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"Hey Honey, he isn't the only one with a foot long."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,We're his niche market.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"I just prefer the one at the Henderson's, that's all."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"When you said'How about dinner and a movie?', I was expecting something a bit different."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Do you know what you want?
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Ballgame night isn’t what it used to be.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,He really doesn't have a feel for the Meals on Wheels concept.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,I miss NAFTA!
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"Honey, I'd rather eat out tonight."
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,I wish our new roommate didn't work from so much.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,I just don't have the same enthusiasm for eating junk food watching a game at home.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Your turn to get take-out.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,These dogs followed me home.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,This is the best BnB yet
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"""Finally something quicker than Domino's""."
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,We better record this show. The lunch rush gets noisy.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Vendor bender.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,I'm glad you were up to food truck and chill tonight.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I really don't think this counts as dining in.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,You still can't get borscht.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Just ignore him He's trying to get a jump on Amazon.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,It just looked so charming on Amazon.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,Yeah it's convient but a limited menu.
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"He is paid by the hour, but the kitchen is now our new video game room."
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I miss going out to eat.
1986,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,577,He said we're not within the delivery area.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"God, I can still taste that hot dog from lunch, . . . and smell it too."
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,We don't care about your viewing angle.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,I can't be bothered to go and get a hot dog.
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,Those kids drag anything home!
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,"No thanks, honey. I can hear the ice cream truck coming through the dining room and I want to get a Bomb Pop!"
1986,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,577,"When you put it that way, a hot dog does sound pretty good!"
1986,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,577,I'm a PostMates gold member.
2126,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,577,"He's over his sitophobia; agoraphobia, not so much."
2126,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,577,He needs to stop emptying the grease trap into our toilet.
2126,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,577,"It never fails, i should not eat a big lunch."
