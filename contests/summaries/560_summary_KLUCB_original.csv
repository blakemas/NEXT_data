326,2,13,12,27,1.6296296296296295,0.12110775673408705,560,Poor guy's still upset about Lucy.
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,He's been like that ever since GEICO let him go.
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,He's been like this since the dawn of time.
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,Looks nice but I like our fall-in shelter much better
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,"Yes, his frontal lobe is larger and he dwells above ground, but is he really happy?"
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,Looks like they got a new bouncer.
326,1,15,11,27,1.6296296296296295,0.1087110201044952,560,I feel like a Neanderthal at these gallery events.
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,"""He still refuses to go clubbing with us""."
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,I thought you said he was into the menage.
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,He's still afraid of the basement.
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,"Man, I wish I'd thought of that."
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,"I tried talking to him, but he doesn't do that yet."
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,I shouldn't have posted that on his wall...
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,"Pity he's had to close his gallery but, really, cave paintings are so last year."
326,6,5,16,27,1.6296296296296295,0.1614407016126175,560,Did we miss Park Street Station?
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,That's one of those new prefab homes.
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,A glimpse of how the upper 1% lives.
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,Look at Mr. Fancy.

326,7,3,17,27,1.6296296296296295,0.17003559329204299,560,Horizontalists think they're so smart.
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,I tried to tell him they're just shadows.
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,"Well, I think the foyer is pretentious."
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,He's still mad I clubbed you first.
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,Damn! Another toll.
326,2,13,12,27,1.6296296296296295,0.12110775673408705,560,What did you ever see in that Neanderthal?
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,Maybe we're in the wrong bomb shelter?
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,And he called our place a hole.
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,I won't let him go clubbing.
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,I knew we should have dug sideways.
326,4,9,14,27,1.6296296296296295,0.14270632235177425,560,I told you Jim's too mainstream to go underground.
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,He's been right before.
326,3,11,13,27,1.6296296296296295,0.13234837207221575,560,Darn cavesteaders.
326,5,7,15,27,1.6296296296296295,0.15236173170508188,560,Promise you won’t play matchmaker.

371,4,2,10,16,1.625,0.2212653007891959,560,"Don't worry, he'll cave eventually."
371,3,9,12,24,1.625,0.14511989046542054,560,See? I told you Ogg now live in hi-rise.
371,3,9,12,24,1.625,0.14511989046542054,560,A critic said his paintings were derivative.
375,2,12,12,26,1.6153846153846154,0.12498520622516866,560,I heard rumours of this neighborhood being gentrified.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,It’s a doorman cave. We’ll definitely have to tunnel our way in.
375,7,2,17,26,1.6153846153846154,0.17608497141937846,560,He was smart to buy now. When the Second Avenue subway is finished this neighborhood's going to go crazy.
375,6,4,16,26,1.6153846153846154,0.16711969986461875,560,What is Republican?
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,At least we have a pool.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,He's got cave franchises everywhere.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,"Gee, that place didn't look nearly so nice on Zillow."
375,2,12,12,26,1.6153846153846154,0.12498520622516866,560,It looks comfy now but just wait until the bear comes back.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,All he ever wanted was to be a U.S. Attorney.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,All of these above ground caves have totally gentrified the neighborhood.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,I understand he has geothermal heating.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,Interesting. I never would have thought about turning it sideways
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,Says his name is Donald and he was once president of the United States.
375,2,12,12,26,1.6153846153846154,0.12498520622516866,560,So that's where Link went missing.
375,2,12,12,26,1.6153846153846154,0.12498520622516866,560,I dig it
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,Maybe we're too primitive for a menage a' trois.
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,Today they are crossed. Yesterday he held them up to the sky. What do you think he's up to?
375,6,4,16,26,1.6153846153846154,0.16711969986461875,560,Only 1336 days left.
375,2,12,12,26,1.6153846153846154,0.12498520622516866,560,"Yeah, but the closets are way too small."
375,6,4,16,26,1.6153846153846154,0.16711969986461875,560,Gary looks like he could really use a Junior Mint.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,Yes...he may have invented the cave...but he still needs our invention...outdoor plumbing!
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,Just because he's in the oval office doesn't make him any less of a Neanderthal.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,He does manage to create a certain prehistoric ambiance....
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,And I'll bet it doesn't fill up with water when it rains.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,How can he afford it on one income?
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,I can't believe he sits there all day and watches re-runs of the big hunt.
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,"He calls it a subway, says he's waiting for a train."
375,1,14,11,26,1.6153846153846154,0.11200169060431571,560,I could never stand to be cooped up like that.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,"Don't worry. The train doesn't come for 5,000 years."
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,Another McMansion blocking the view.
375,2,12,12,26,1.6153846153846154,0.12498520622516866,560,See? He has a mancave and all I have this manhole.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,He calls it cave dwelling. It'll never catch on.
375,0,16,10,26,1.6153846153846154,0.09730085108210404,560,It still has outdoor plumbing
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,I told you we should have gotten the horizontal model
375,6,4,16,26,1.6153846153846154,0.16711969986461875,560,What an ingenious solution to the problem of getting stepped on by a mammoth!
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,What's next? Fire?
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,How'd he do that? He put the hole over him!
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,And that's where he gets all his news.
375,2,12,12,26,1.6153846153846154,0.12498520622516866,560,See! A rare sighting of 'The Petulant Male' in its natural habitat.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,Whoever discovered beans last week needs a clubbing.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,I heard he made his shells on mammoth futures.
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,I think we just invented surveillance!
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,That idiot thinks he's Plato.
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,Should we tell him the unisex bathroom is free?
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,That's it!: We have to make the hole go sideways!
375,5,6,15,26,1.6153846153846154,0.15764539639937847,560,I hear he moved out of his parents' place to become a painter.
375,3,10,13,26,1.6153846153846154,0.13674145257408601,560,"Oh no, it's his press secretary."
375,4,8,14,26,1.6153846153846154,0.14756404687116062,560,"If your husband sees us, our hole relationship is over."
423,4,6,13,23,1.608695652173913,0.16320808554990182,560,I knew unisex restrooms were a mistake.
423,3,8,12,23,1.608695652173913,0.15061311370164152,560,"Sometimes,I wish we could move on to the next eon."
423,3,8,12,23,1.608695652173913,0.15061311370164152,560,I told you there was a crease in the map.
423,3,8,12,23,1.608695652173913,0.15061311370164152,560,We aren't keeping up with the Jones.
423,3,8,12,23,1.608695652173913,0.15061311370164152,560,"Maybe if you were better at hunting and gathering, we could afford a place like that."
423,3,8,12,23,1.608695652173913,0.15061311370164152,560,You're really choosing getting mauled by a bear over a little experimentation?
429,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,560,Two or three raindrops and he caves.
429,6,3,16,25,1.6,0.17320508075688773,560,We could invite him over but we'd basically be inventing the third wheel.
429,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,560,Make him an offer? Lets just bash 'im in the head and take the damned place.
429,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,560,He did it- he actually built a wall. What a putz.
429,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,560,His wife ran off with a Homo sapiens
429,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,560,That must be where we transfer to the J
429,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,560,Looks like he is guarding the allegory.
429,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,560,I didn't expect there to be a cover charge.
429,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,560,He won't budge. Time for some eminent domain.
429,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,560,"I'll lick yours, if you lick mine."
429,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,560,"Don't be a wuss. If he didn't want to hear about Green Peace, he should have put up a ""no soliciting"" sign."
429,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,560,Zillow has it listed at 16.5 stones.
429,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,560,My nipples are cold too.
429,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,560,"You distract the guard, I'll steal the cave painting."
429,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,560,His name is Jones. I suppose now we'll have to keep up with him.
429,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,560,"It's on the first floor, but at least there's a doorman."
429,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,560,"One man, all alone, in what's left of his Tower. Yet, he persisted!"
429,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,560,You just can't trust a man who doesn't like a good hole.
429,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,560,So that's what they call a staycation!
429,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,560,She got the club and he got the cave.
429,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,560,The meteorites took out everything but the roaches and Harold.
429,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,560,Maybe we should let the groundhog tell him.
429,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,560,"You know what? ""Cave Man"" does have a better ring to it than ""Hole Man""..."
429,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,560,"When the real estate bubble bursts, you'll see I was right about renting."

780,3,7,13,23,1.565217391304348,0.15174983257274677,560,He'll never get this by the zoning board.
780,3,7,13,23,1.565217391304348,0.15174983257274677,560,He calls it 'The Great Indoors'
780,1,11,11,23,1.565217391304348,0.12297509238026912,560,Don't you just love mid-paleozoic modern?
780,4,5,14,23,1.565217391304348,0.16425766604885492,560,Is there another entrance to your parents' cave?
780,3,7,13,23,1.565217391304348,0.15174983257274677,560,"Nouveau enough for you? Plus, now he wants drawings on the walls."
780,5,3,15,23,1.565217391304348,0.17587822499041098,560,It's his new man cave.
780,3,7,13,23,1.565217391304348,0.15174983257274677,560,I hear he put granite countertops in his kitchen.
808,1,7,8,16,1.5625,0.15728821740147395,560,He can call it a foyer all he wants. Still smells like bear's ass.
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,I told you the exact change lane is never a good idea
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Funny, he doesn't look Chinese."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,He seems happier since he closed his Facehole account
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"First we domesticate the wolf, discover fire, then invent the door and doorbell."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I've heard its somehow waterproof!
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,"Let's hole up here for the night. We can talk to the ""Great One"" tomorrow."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,This gentrification is out of control
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Horizontal! Of course. It makes so much more sense.
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,"If he sees his shadow, it's another year of no evolution."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"Drog, what are you doing? We're supposed to shelter in place."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"He's house rich, but grubs poor."
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,He bought the Penthouse when we went co-op.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"Yeah, he's gay, and you know what that means? He's going co-op."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"For that price, I'd insist on cross-ventilation."
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,"Oh great, another art gallery opened."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,I guess we're all grounded.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,Oh! Oh! I think your husband is on to us
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,The hole isn't good enough for him. He's calling himself a 'Caveman' now.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,There must be an easier way to sneak out of your parents' den!
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,"Yeah, it's ok, but he's got a balloon mortgage. He'll be out of there in a year."
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,"He's already invented fire and the wheel, I'm sure he can come up with a way for us to get out of this hole."
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,Gentrification is just killing our neighborhood.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Ugg ..don’t see shadow. Me forecast 6 millenia more housing inequality!”
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He's a comet impact denier'
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,Poor Mankoff. He can't see beyond the shadows.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Doesn't your dad ever sleep?
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,The first hack.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"See, I told you he floats on aura at home"
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,But it doesn't collect rainwater.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"He thinks ""cul de sac"" sounds pretentious."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He's pouting because we're in the hot tub.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"I'd have to say lizard, Wanda."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Sure, he has a lovely home, but is he really happy?"
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,You can use the cave that suits your gender identity
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Sure, but he doesn't have an in-ground pool."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,I hate using the hot tub when others are waiting.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Aren't you proud that our son has moved up in the world?
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Damn one-percenter!
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,The only difference is when it rains.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Poor guy. Lives in a rock.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Late, but too funny not to submit: "" I'll be havin' no fairies like Tink on this 'ere ship."""
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Location, location, location...I told you we should have made a counter offer."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Grog's cave make him one-percenter.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,...as if he thought of putting the hole on its side!
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He's a one-percenter. Made a fortune in pointy sticks.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"We need a cave and you need a toilet, let's work this out!"
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Now that is what I call a starter home.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"He calls it 'three walls and a roof,' but it will never catch on."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"That's not what I meant when I said ""Cave in""."
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,He's waiting for Plato.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"We finally learn to walk erect, and he just sits there."
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,No Mensa membership his future!
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,When they said a cave with a built in pool I was hoping for more.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,He's going to be so jealous when these vertical caves take off.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,And that's the penthouse.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"What's so appealing about having a roof over your head, anyway?"
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,It'll never last.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Your father must have slept there all night, he's still in his PJs."
809,5,1,14,20,1.55,0.19834844406538182,560,Clan of the cave bear meet clan of the gopher.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Threeway?
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,I told you it was flat.
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,Somehow he picked that hole up and attached it to the side of the hill!
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,He might find it easier to go in and out but he doesn't have a shower.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,Wait for it - wait for it.....he's about to do absolutely nothing.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,He says he won't come unless we get cable so he can watch The Flintstones.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"Gee, I think we dug the wrong way."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I hear he ate his roommate...
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He thinks he's so great with that horizontal hole.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,You said your dad would be asleep!
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,I'll admit it does have curb appeal
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,"Nice space, but his roommate's an animal."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Eve, this is not the right wormhole of knowledge but we can try it out."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I really thought WWIII would do more to disrupt wealth inequality.
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,Oog. Your husband wait up. This like being stuck in bad cave painting.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"He's living way beyond his means. But let's be honest, we're in the hole ourselves."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"if he's waiting for the cows to come home, he's out of luck - they were delicious!"
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He's a damn fool. You can't live under a rock and expect to understand how things work.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"Bob! Come on, your mani/pedi must be dried by now!"
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"""He spends all day there drawing pictures of his pets on the wall""."
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,I wonder who is the Hunter and who is the Prey?
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,This timeshare is always rented at this time of year!
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,He's contemplating the next step in his new game called Golf!
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,Wouldn't know us from a hole in the ground.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He has been acting that way since he came out and discovered fire.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,His property taxes are mountainous.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"This pretentious ""McCave"" trend is destroying the character of the neighborhood."
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,Let's call that agoraphobia.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"I've had it, Sheila...tonight your brother gets the guest room."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He'll always need time outs
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,She left him for a guy with a fire pit.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"""Your dad looks mad, what time was I suppose to get you home""?"
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,That's how the one percent lives.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Should we wiretap his smoke signals?
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,His girlfriend said she was a vegan and he doesn't know what that means.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Don't you love his embrace of minimalism.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Oh, I guess we could've just walked out."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,How the 1% Live
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"If he's a ""caveman,"" what does that make us?"
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,Yeah it's nice but I'd hate to be the one who had to clean it.
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,"Look, I'm sorry for calling you a Neanderthal. But if you don't come with us now, you might not make it past this Era."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,How does he afford a cave on the salary of a neanderthal?
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I guess he knows his house from a hole in the ground.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Shall we murder him?
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"Imagine, no possessions..."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,It's very exclusive. Look important and walk sexy.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I like the flow of his foyer.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"If he gets a boulder, are you gonna want a bouder ?"
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,He's always been at the vanguard of the architectural movement.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Just tell him our names are on the list.
809,5,1,14,20,1.55,0.19834844406538182,560,Lebo621
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"Frankly, I think the ground floor is overrated."
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,It looks like another case of affluenza.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,I just wish we could get him to try eHarmony.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,That's the trouble with modern architecture - No privacy.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,A tin cup and violin and he's all set
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Okay, fine. I'll cave."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"A cave drawing is never done, just abandoned."
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,I don't mind if he stays there as long as he doesn't give me any crap when I go to get the lawn mower out.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,I can't believe you dated that Neanderthal.
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,He has great form for a stowaway.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,He'll be there forever. It's rent controlled.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Since when did they begin a cover charge?
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,He is waiting for some guy named Godot.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Gentrification.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Frank has been sulking ever since his T-rex ate his homework.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"As soon as the bear comes back and eats him, the cave will be ours."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Hole-in-groundman sound just as good as caveman.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,You don't think tickling his feet will work this time?
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,FIRE!

809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,He's protesting a system which devalues his masculinity and interior decor.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,Are you sure he's our relative?
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"If we save our rocks, honey, we could afford a cave like that."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,One can only dream. Why does one man need all that space?

809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,Technically he does indeed have a home.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I'm worried too. He refuses to hunt and gather.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,Hi. We're your new neighbors and we're having a little hole warming.

809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,We really should have used a better architect.
809,1,9,10,20,1.55,0.13523858060557473,560,"Remember, honey: it's best to have the worst house on the best block."
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,"Sorry Ron, the hole is only accepting 'diverse' candidates at this time."

809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,"Sure, I'd like a man-cave, but we're in pretty deep already."
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,The one percent.
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I told you we should have used our points for the upgrade.
809,4,3,13,20,1.55,0.1846048411294272,560,Grok right. 'Hole Earth Catalog' no good for real estate.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,So this is the lout at the end of the tunnel?
809,2,7,11,20,1.55,0.15346866644024565,560,I can't believe I hate the hole thing.
809,3,5,12,20,1.55,0.1697521412933699,560,Can you believe that only six months ago that guy was president of the United States!?

988,3,4,12,19,1.5263157894736843,0.17718429716424697,560,It must be rent controlled. There's no other way he could afford to live there as a bachelor.

1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,I do not have a holier-than-thou attitude. I simply want to be more than just another unevolved caveman.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"Well, at least we have each other."
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,He says it's not a midlife crisis.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,He is single and he has his own cave. What a catch
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,"The first documented ""Brotherhood of Neanderthal Cabe Artists"" sit in."
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,But you have to have sex with the bear.
1100,4,1,13,18,1.5,0.20211302086361083,560,"Don't worry, he won't see us. He doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground."
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,He's coming into the Stone Age kicking and screaming...
1100,0,9,9,18,1.5,0.12126781251816648,560,Careful! Don't let him suspect we're desperate to rent.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,Grogh promised him completion of the Second Avenue tunnel by spring.
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,Horizontal holes will never catch on.
1100,4,1,13,18,1.5,0.20211302086361083,560,"Eve, we're not the only ones!"
1100,0,9,9,18,1.5,0.12126781251816648,560,"Tell your dad, it's just till we get back on our feet."
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,Did you call ahead for a reservation?
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"It's nice, but he'll have to give it up once he's married."
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,I don't think he's realized that we've escaped yet.
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,"He seems smug, but ours is vertically integrated."
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,Little does he know...that's the back end of a Brontosaurus
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,....we should totally make a Harlem Shake video together
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,His conditions for coming out are impeachment or resignation
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,So he's got a penthouse. That doesn't make him smarter than we are.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,His new place really is a hole in the wall!
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"It's nice, but I wouldn't want to live in a high-rise."
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,You know what they say about men with big caves.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,He said he just wouldn't use the communal bathroom.
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,When I get out of this hole I'm going to be just like him.
1100,0,9,9,18,1.5,0.12126781251816648,560,He's going to be insufferable the next time it rains.
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,Big deal. If there's a flood it'll still fill up.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,That's the dream.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"If his house is so hot, why doesn't he have a woman?"
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"Now we can sleep. When the ball comes, Zork will alarm us."
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,"Hmm, this one looks like a Head of Household tax filer."
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"And, get this - it's rent contolled!"
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,I fear the era of the holeman is over.
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,I don't care what he says. We have the cave...he has the hole!
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"I don't know about this one - it's airy, but does it have a basement?"
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"Lately, he spend more time in dog house cave than own cave."
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,I knew your mom would be up waiting for us!!
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,That's how fabulously wealthy the top one-third is.
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,So this is where he thinks up fake news.
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,Aren’t we ALL a little tired of living on a ‘miniature’ golf course?
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,He went with that new sideways model.
1100,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,560,Shhhh ... the Prime Directive.
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,"Hate surveillance, you sure we got the right cave?"" surveillance"
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,Don't you think he's been in timeout long enough?
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,Look at those new digs. I heard he made a killing selling dinosaurs short.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,I guess it was just a matter of time before this neighborhood became gentrified.
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,he bought before the crash
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,...not to mention bird poop.
1100,0,9,9,18,1.5,0.12126781251816648,560,Maybe we should get a pest report before talking to the agent.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,He's been depressed since someone called him a spelunker.
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,"Careful, he’s an whac-a-mole champion!"
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,That's the start of Ticketmaster.
1100,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,560,"You call this a hole, look at that guy's place."
1100,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,560,And he thinks we live in a shithole.
1100,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,560,"Come back into the jacuzzi, frank"

1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,See? I told you we were doing it wrong.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,I say let him pout for a bit. As soon as he notices the size of the claw prints going into the cave I bet he'll think this hole is perfectly big enough for three!!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He said he's waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He calls it 'horizontal living.'
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,We found it! The original man cave!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"What do you mean, 'We'll understand when it rains'?"
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Honey, trust me, it may look nice but it's a real hole in the wall."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"I'll bet you he's not an atheist."""
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He's been set ever since he invented the wheel.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Passed up for another promotion Bork?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Usually I only have to worry about waking up our pet mammoth.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"He may have a cave, but if we finish digging we'll have a display case."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"If he is an ideal form, let's go back down and keep watching the shadows."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"The sooner we get this over with, the sooner I can get back to my canasta game."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"The commutes a little rugged, but its a doorman building!"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"My Dad said, if we watch our sticks and stones, we might be able to move out of this hole one day, and find a nice ditch."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,They say he just paints all day.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,I still say what they're charging for the view isn't worth the price.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Damn it's chilly in here!
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,I think I like horizontal tunnels better.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,His grand house doesn't fit the neighborhood.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,But think of the upkeep!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,In any event it will preserve his paintings.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,So much for our holistic approach
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,He drew on the walls again.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"It's nice, but I'm not ready for another fixer-upper."
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,"Babe, I gotta get me a man-cave."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,I always wanted to live in a cave with a doorman.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He wants to be first in line for Hamilton.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Do you think we should cave in?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He invested in wheel technology when we already have a subway. Sad.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He always sulks when he loses at body golf.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Ever since sweeps week started, Gork's been glued to that wall"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Fred calls it ""a condo"", but it will never replace a hole in the ground for elegant living."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,I hear his HOA fees are ridiculous.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Honey, this is ridiculous. We should have just paid the pay-per-view fee."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Don't let him lull you into a false sense of security.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,When will he evolve into a man?
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,We can't move. Our place is rent controlled.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He's waiting for the completion of the new Hudson River tunnel.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Well, I guess that sort of worked."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,And when I get to China? Then what?
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Someday we’ll get out of this hell hole and have a cave of our own.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"He used to be a caveman in a hole, but now he's an a-hole in a cave."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,You call this 'the spare bedroom'?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"I'd like to leave the hole, too, but we've got rent control."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Zog, please stop drawing on the walls and come to dinner!"
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"I just said ""Lure it out and we'll catch it"". What's to think about?"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He needs to step outside his caveman zone.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Ever since he moved into a high-rise he's been so full of himself.
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,So he gets to live large and we're in this shithole!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Glar didn't care about the volcano, she shouldn't have looked at Zep the way she did"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"If this is the right cave, his name is Dave."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,So this is China?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Yeah - I like the open floor plan too, but lets redo the entrance."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,i think he is telling us we're at the crossroads of our life
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"Personally, I prefer to live in the boroughs."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"One day we'll have a penthouse, too."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Somebody needs to take on these 33%-ers!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Just what this neighborhood needs -- another hole in the wall joint.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Now he's just being a jerk.
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,How long before he caves in?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,The writing's on the wall.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Well, he did warn us that marriage would be a shit-hole."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,It's always the real estate agents who snap up the best places.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Time out again?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He hasn't been the same since he lost his job doing those Geico ads.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,His place really is a hole in the wall.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Of course our artisanal hole is better.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,One day the cavemen and the holemen will be friends. One day.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Identity crisis.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Looks like he's having buyers remorse.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,We are the 99%. And I think I just invented math.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Yep, looks like he's still mad because he thinks I stole his wheel invention."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Just think, someday we could live in a home like that."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"All I said was, 'you're acting like a Neanderthal.'"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Yes, but we're vertically integrated."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He's the bouncer for that cave. We will have to dig some more and come up behind him to get into the private casino!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,That's too much house for him.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Here we have the allegory of the cable TV news cycle and yes, that is our president."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Ever wonder what it's like to live in a rock, not under one?"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"We. the Mole People, must defeat they, the Tunnel People."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Roofs are just a fad.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"""Horizontal! Brilliant!"
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He took that 'enemy of the cavemen' comment to heart.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"He´s the last living Neanderthal, and he says that the Cro-Magnon diet will lead to extinction."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,I knew we should have taken that left turn at Albuquerque.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,He's not like us. He thinks tunnels must be horizontal.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Yeah it's nice, but there's no garage!"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Yes, 'slaves were immigrants' was his brainchild."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Yeah, but I hear his rent is through the roof."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"Wow, that’s a real hole in the wall."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,All that rushing...told you we would be early.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,What do you think the square footage is?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"If I knew he was that good, he could have stayed."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He keeps muttering that he 'liked the shadows better than the puppets.'
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He had a better architect.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"When the volcano blows, it's pretty hard to judge pouters in a dank cave from our deep hole in the ground."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Why would we want to move uptown to this?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"""Just imagine the property taxes"" Thor said defensively."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"It's true what they say, location is everything."
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,His friends have started calling him a caveman.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Very nice. Makes our place look like a hole in the ground.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He invented the third wheel.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Looks like we still have a ways to go.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Lucy left him
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,It's like he doesn't think of himself as a holeman anymore.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,We need to dig a few more feet to get past security.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Maybe he was born since the Cold War and is confused about what shelter means.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Another twenty feet of digging, and we could have claimed squatter's rights!"
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,I'm so over living in the basement.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Why does he keep calling it a 'man-cave'?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He’s so sensitive about his weight.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,I didn't think you would actually crawl back into a cave.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Mmm. Penthouse. I'm impressed.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Call my patent guy, I think I just invented the third wheel."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He has everything and he's still not happy.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Was Siri stoned when she gave you these directions
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He put everything he had into a subway scam.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"He said he lived in a high-rise, but I didn't believe him!"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Are we in time out or is he in time out?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Your ex-boyfriend always had a knack for real estate.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Yell 'Fire!' and let's see what he does.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Check out that horizontal hole layout!
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,No coed hot tubbing for Ong. He's a man cave kinda guy.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,New Google campus.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"A caveman in a cave, what a cliché."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"True, losing Jack to a perpendicular universe felt sad"
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Great. He'll probably make it all cozy by painting some animals on the walls next.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Should we invite him over?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Do you think he's sad because we erased his cave paintings?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Maybe we should have gone for a highrise too.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"So far he's only got ""T-U-N-N"" and he's not quite happy with that."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Ours is affordable. His is market.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,He's just in a slump. Artist's block. It happens.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Next his wife will want a she-shack.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"I like his wheel idea, but this television thing will be the end of civilization."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Well Og, I guess no one likes to feel like the third...hey that gives me an idea!"
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Doesn't look like he's going to cave.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Prefab caves are really in right now.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Then you jump out and dance before Ogg gets bitten.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Original, ""Grand Opening of the Holland Tunnel,"" festivities."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He wanted the painting a little up and to the left.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"You're right, the new units have no privacy whatsoever, you can see everything."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,I think they call it a man cave.
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,He said his man cave has a better ring to it than our man hole.
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,That looks like a grizzly place to take a knap.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,So this is Rocky's idea of thinking outside of the cave?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He is agoraphobic.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,So that's how the other third lives.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Do you think we should warn him about that volcano in the distance?
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,"No honey, you don't need a man cave"
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He said he wanted to move to an echo the CIA couldn't hear him from
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,He's been so moody since he went paleo.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,The HOA is not going to like what Ralph did...
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,His body English isn't helping....
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,i wonder if he'll sublet.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Maybe it's time to tell him the new deodorant isn't working.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,We'll message him from China.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,And the above ground caves come with lobby attendants.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Look at him - watching his new 52 inch painting in that bachelor-cave, not a worry in the Cenozoic."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"It takes skill to build a complex system of tunnels underground! Anyone can ""find"" a cave."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Should we go back for him?
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"He calls it his man cave, whatever that is."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,It's just a fad -- troglodytes won't last.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,I didn't know lactose intolerance was even a thing yet.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,It's no wonder she won't come back. He lives in a CAVE!
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,We're not keeping up.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"I'm a ""holeman"", end of discussion."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Honey, did I think you forgot to lock the door again..."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,We'd never get past the doorman.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Looks like we have a squatter.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Now that’s evolution! Our children are growing up in a world where the earths’ upper crust has two different meanings!
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,"It was a nasty divorce but he got the house."""
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,"Just wait and see, a roof will cause cancer."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Betsy called him a Neanderthal.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,I don’t want to live at my dad’s.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,I'll bet we could boost Grog's energy level with a chthonic colonic.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Needs a stuffed mammoth head and a neon beer sign.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Ogg knew Og should taken dat left turn at Albuquerque.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Look! Is that a Steve Bannon?"" ""Yes, honey, It looks like one, doesn't it?"
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"C'mon Zork, help us dig for grubs. No one is ever going to care about your animal pictures."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"Well....Yes, I think there's room enough for us."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,I prefer our skylight.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Smug, pseudo neanderthal, thinks he's better than us"
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,Honey! I like the neighborhood. The Neanderthal Model even comes with a model!!
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,How do you know we're not the Neanderthals?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Yes it is nice but it may not be rent controlled
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"I worry about him, Margaret. Since he lost his job all he ever does is sit at home watching cave paintings."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,So this is how the 1% live.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Location, location, location."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Caves are so bourgeoisie.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Dave really thinks his new home is better than a hole in the ground just because he can watch cave art anytime he wants.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,That's the bouncer. He's got the best club around.
1393,3,1,12,16,1.4375,0.20348525745124632,560,It's newly renovated and they allow dogs.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,See what he did there? He built his cave parallel to the ground.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,They'll be calling that the one percent.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,I'll bet he doesn't have a wet basement
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Fine, let him go sit in a cave and see how far he gets in this world."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Bob's not such a great shaman -- we asked him to make us ""whole""."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"It's called 'hygge', the Danish concept of living simply."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,He's always been a right-brain thinker
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,He's grounded for the Stone Age.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"A vertical door really would improve the property value, Hon."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,I thought Neanderthal bouncers were extinct.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,"I tried to tell him it's fake news, but he just keeps staring at the wall."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,Nice job Stan. So much for ecotouring in China.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"Sure, he looks smug now, but I'm telling you, this tiny-cave trend is going to be THE next big thing."
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Definitely not Eloi - and I'm getting hungry.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Moving into a tiny home was the best decision we've made.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,I always knew he'd end up in the penthouse.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,It's called evolution...... Dear
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,They told him his work was derivative.
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,I just really hope evolution takes care of this kind of behavior before it becomes president.
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Damn gentrification!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,"You were right again, digging horizontal was a better plan."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Yeah, but at least ours has running water."
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Should we invite him below?
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,They say that style's better when it rains.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"""Holeman"" is good too, right?"
1393,0,7,9,16,1.4375,0.128086884574495,560,Fine! You can gather.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Before the invention of the wheel, third wheels like Derek were called ""not sex-pit material"""
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,The grass is always greener in the other cave.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,It's 2007BC Grog. A year from now we'll be buying his cave for pebbles on the rocks!
1393,2,3,11,16,1.4375,0.1818596070232933,560,Hole man has a better ring to it but let's see if it catches on.
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"He's got his man cave, I've got you."
1393,1,5,10,16,1.4375,0.15728821740147395,560,"Location, location, location."
1637,2,3,12,17,1.411764705882353,0.17275500183045192,560,"His 'neo-Neolithic,' I could justify. But the 'bombed back to' is simply gratuitous."
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,I have a really weird idea—why don't we start a fair housing administration?
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,He's stuck in a cave echo chamber.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"We build a moat, and Mexico pays for it. What doesn't he understand?"
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,"Sure, Trump Cave has a doorman, but would you want to live there?"
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,"He thinks in the future they will say early man lived in caves,boy what an idiot!"
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,Those McMansions are ruining the neighborhood.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"I'm not sure, he just grunted"
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"I guess rock, paper, scissors is out of the question."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Maybe you shouldn't have told him cave paintings were abstract.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,I don't know how he can afford the rent.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,She left him for a guy with wheels.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,I told you we should have stopped and asked for directions.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,"I'm pretty sure I won't be back to host the Oscars, but you two will be fine."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Why don't we move into a condo too.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,I think it's a HUD home.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,"Alone again, naturally."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,we dug all the way under the border and look .. he hasn't taken our jobs at all!
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,I don't think your father likes me.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,If you like that kind of hole we can check the online listings.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"So tell me again, what makes this a garden apartment?"
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,"Those modern homes are nice, but I prefer the charm of living in an old-fashioned hole."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"We may not have any walls, but we're not talking to any either!"
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,"Separate bathrooms, too?"
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,And I heard the kitchen has granite counter tops.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,He doesn't believe there's a China.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,Radical!
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,Haven't we seen this one before?
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,I have to admit. It has a better ring to it than Hole in the Dirt Man.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Another Brooklyn hipster? We gotta get out of this hole!
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,He looks P.T.B. Pre-Travel Ban.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,Keeping up with Jones just got a bit harder.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,He got tired of folks just dropping in.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,Orrg is absolutely addicted to Netflix.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,"He just keeps saying, ""Mr. Sanders if you're NASTY!"""

1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,"Yeah, it's a nice place, but I'd hate to have his mortgage."
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,"Every time we go on a home tour, you get dissatisfied with our place."
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,This neighborhood is gentrifying too fast.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,I think it's clearly oversized for the neighborhood.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Looks like a case of painter's block.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,You’re the one who wanted a convertible.

1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,Its probably above our pay grade but I think we should make an offer.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,He'll be back.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,I think he'll cave into our demands pretty soon.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,One final obstacle between us and the Bronze Age.

1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,Kids these days! Why can't they find a nice hole like their parents?
1638,3,0,12,15,1.4,0.2138089935299395,560,Me wonder why this called Mini Golf Valley.

1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"He may have the cave, but at least we have each other."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"As you can see, it is a one bedroom, with a doorman wall paintings, and a great view."
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,He's just not into hide & go seek.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,His hole is all wrong.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"Honey, you don't want to have the most expensive house on the block."
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,"Rather than get that new furnace, he decided to invest in health care."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,He doesn’t care… recall… impeach…alien takeover… whatever. Then he’s coming out.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Maybe he's right. Maybe our place really is a hole in the ground.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,We can get in. I know the bouncer.

1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,I think he is waiting for the cable guy.
1638,3,0,12,15,1.4,0.2138089935299395,560,His place is a hole in the wall.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,He won it playing Whack-A-Mole.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Maybe we should have moved to Canada.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Great! We're beyond his evil wall.

1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,Poor guy. I should lend him my copy of Plato's Republic.
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,"And get this, he calls it his ""man-cave""."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,That hole in the wall make our place look like a hole in the ground.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Should we tell him the groundhog already saw his shadow?
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,"You know, he may have a point."
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"He calls it a ""mortgage."
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,He looks like a down-to-earth kind of guy. Shall we invite him over?
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,We tunneled under the wall for this?
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,The horizontal cave. Brilliant. And we thought his wheel was something.
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,"He'll never leave, it's rent controlled."
1638,2,2,11,15,1.4,0.1902379462422684,560,The guy's fire goes out and he wins 'Extreme Cave Makeover!' You gotta be kiddin'.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"Dude, you were right! I dug myself into a hole by getting married."
1638,0,6,9,15,1.4,0.13093073414159545,560,Told you he would cave in.
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,Whoops
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,"Damn it, one more McMansion!"
1638,1,4,10,15,1.4,0.16329931618554522,560,I suspect that he may be evolving prematurely.

1769,2,2,12,16,1.375,0.17969882210706523,560,"Although he doesn't agree, we still got him to cave."
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"I'll duck down, you give him the eye and when he comes over I'll cut him up then we can move in"

1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,I think the 'man hole' concept will live on long after the 'man cave' has been forgotten.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,He doesn't look Oriental to me.

1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,Should we admit he was right about caves? Not until he comes around on fire.
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,I thought your lawyer said you were getting the house.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,Homo erectus at about noon.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"Sure, a cave is nice. But it doesn't have the fresh air and natural light of a foxhole."
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,I've forgotten the password.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,He never could dig a decent hole.
1769,2,2,12,16,1.375,0.17969882210706523,560,"Look, Deb, I know he's still your little boy, but he needs to come out of his shell or he'll never meet a nice cave girl."
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,He just invented the third wheel.
1769,2,2,12,16,1.375,0.17969882210706523,560,The original 'time out.' The origin of the 'time out.'
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,I don't think we can afford the taxes and HOAs.
1769,2,2,12,16,1.375,0.17969882210706523,560,We're not even going to look at it if it doesn't have a wine cellar.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,When did the Rockinghams get a doorman?
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,Dude's got a Mansion!
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"I'm sorry I always called him ""scaredy cat"" when we were kids. It wasn't his fault that he was just the cautious one in the family!"
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"Well, there goes our above-ground parking."
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"Just because he knows which way to dig, doesn't mean he's a better kisser."
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,First gentrification. Next it'll be Holocenials moving in and fire.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"He can join us when he has been ""extremely vetted."""
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,Yeah it's more spacious but imagine the rent.
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,"He's part of the top one percent."""
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,He has been depressed since his ex-wife took his dog.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,Hey Bruno! Come try out the hot tub!
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,The idiot! He dug his burrow sideways!
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,Divorce him! It's now--or never.
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,So that's the new style in caves!
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"You know, I think he's on to sonething."
1769,2,2,12,16,1.375,0.17969882210706523,560,I don't care what Sir David Attenborough will say. I am NOT waiting ten millennia to displace this Neanderthal creep!
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,I hate those smug lateral cave digger types.
1769,2,2,12,16,1.375,0.17969882210706523,560,He says it's his Man Cave but I much prefer our Man Hole.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,There all crazy to live in a cave. We Neanderthals have the right idea. I don't see how those Homosapiens can survive living like that. Trust me.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"What a loser, he'll be called a caveman, instead of a cessman."
1769,2,2,12,16,1.375,0.17969882210706523,560,"Yeah, caveman? Well I know you are but what am I?"
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,He said it's called a man cave.
1769,0,6,10,16,1.375,0.125,560,They told him to go back to the ice age.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,I would not live there. It's a real hole in a wall.
1769,1,4,11,16,1.375,0.15478479684172258,560,"No curb appeal, keep digging."
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,He struggles with the whole man-hole vs man cave thing.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,"One day, we'll get one of those swanky rainproof places like Jeremy."
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,"Since inventing fire, he's become quite arrogant."
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,I always thought you were a little off.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,I cannot bear to tell him who lives there.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,I really thought I'd get the house.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,He obviously hasn't discovered tinder yet.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,Doesn't he know there's a hole world out here?
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,How can he afford a one-bedroom?
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,These time-outs don't seem to be working. How old is he now?
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,How can anyone live so horizontally?
1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,There's less over head in the outer burrows.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,I say we keep digging.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,"Actually, I think a cave is better than a hole, especially when it rains."
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,Think We'll be able to live in the penthouse suite someday.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,Word in the tunnels is that he has really bad breath
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,So this is how the other half lives!
1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,It'll be tougher once he puts his wall up.
1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,"Tarik, when we bought this pace at auction the County said it was uninhabited!"
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,He found the wrong hole.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,"Sure it's appealing, but above-ground living is just a fad."
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,"Yeah, sure it looks nice, but the maintenance costs would kill us."
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,Man in cave. I like it. What do you think?
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,"We crawled into a hole like he said, now what?"
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,He says he's not leaving until we join Greenpeace.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,His character is a real stretch from his previous roles.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,Sometimes he can be such a Neanderthal.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,Dang! We undershot the mastodon carcass by at least 30 yards.

1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,I keep telling him to try caveman.com but he is living in the past.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,"That's the guy who invented the phrase ""Three's a crowd."""
1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,"Shit, I thought we were digging in the other direction!"
1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,He's the strong silent type.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,What? It's not a hole. It's our alternative cave.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,Threesomes never work.
1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,It's the latest thing - I think it's called horizontal housing.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,"So, why would you want to go back to a man without a club to beat you and me?"
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,He said how lovely it would be to have scenes of fighting men and Woolly Mammoths on the walls.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,I'm starting to think his way might have some merit.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,These single-dwelling cave owners are snapping up all the good open space around here recently.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,At least he's got a roof over his head.

1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,"It's spacious, but I bet he's swimming in debt."
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,Seems lightly guarded for such priceless art.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,I hate early adopters.

1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,I think it's called an alternative hole.
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,"Hey, maybe that's why they call us cavemen."
1845,2,1,11,14,1.3571428571428572,0.19909528496696088,560,He says the horozontal model will be the next big thing in shelters.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,I like it. It's hard enough just climbing out of bed every day.

1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,"Is there a back door tunnel, so we can avoid your dad ?"
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,He's vertically challenged.
1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,"Hmm. Modern, yet functional."
1845,1,3,10,14,1.3571428571428572,0.1692628769313117,560,"This is why a wall's a bad idea, Mr. President."

1845,0,5,9,14,1.3571428571428572,0.13289435848843764,560,I suppose it would be alright as long as you didn't mind everyone knowing your business.

3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,Every generation has its New Agers. Back in the day we called 'em frontiersmen.
3148,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,560,"I know our place is a shithole, but he'd better stop using it as a shit hole!"
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,"It's rent-controlled, too."
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,"I'm not sure what it is, but there's just something better about his cave."
3148,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,560,He deconstructed the administrative state.
3148,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,560,He's gone sideways again.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,There goes the neighborhood
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,He's on vacation.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,He still hasn't come to terms that they lost the election.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,Nice! ...but could we afford it?
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,Him not happy. Him want cave have big-screen TV.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,Do you think we can sneak by him ?
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,He just sits there all day watching cave drawings.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,“No use trying to sneak by him”.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,I think he might be on to something
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,You may have to tunnel in to make it before curfew.......
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,"Sorry for all the digging, but intelligence reported he was heavily armed."
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,"They say, absence makes the heart grow fonder."
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,Look at THAT man cave! I'll bet he's a confirmed bachelor!
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,volcano not happy with first 500 days...
3148,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,560,"Maybe when we get some American based job's we can afford a place like that too. Probably not, he's rich but I hear he started a company called politics"
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,He dwells too much.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,The rum isn't that bad.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,"Well, I'll be damned."
3148,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,560,We should've got the hole upgrade package
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,Peek a boo. I see you.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,Hurry. It's orange on top and fat around the middle.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,"I know we're in the garden unit, but does he have to be so smug?"
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,He thinks we are gentrifying the neighborhood.
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,"Roger had to go, but we're naming the flag after him."
3148,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,560,To think I fell for the old I invented the wheel line! We're twenty feet short.
3148,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,560,He won't come back until our political discourse is more civilized.
3182,0,2,9,11,1.1818181818181819,0.12196734422726127,560,"And he kept saying, if we let him stay in the cave, we could have a hut over our heads."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's been that way since that cliffhanger on The Flintstones.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Morris! We're coming through the back door!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Im sure he'll cave and say sorry first
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I thought you told him not to wait up.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"I'm sorry I had to ditch you Larry, but with this cave girl, you can say I hit a one in a hole"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Ready or not, here I come!"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"I""m going in. Text me if he wakes up."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's not registered yet.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Grog want big wall, so Ook no come and block sun."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"It's got curb appeal, but I hate the wall art."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Doesn't he know that there are spiders in that cave?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Since she left he just keeps mumbling 'Yabba-dabba-do'.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I knew we should have kept digging another couple of days.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Is he still looking at his shadow?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Maybe someday we'll get out of this hole and into a rent-controlled cave like Grunk.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I don't think he'll notice if you put it in this hole.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He just had brontosaurus so he has to wait 30 minutes before coming in.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Cave dwelling is just another fad.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's always had a terrible sense of direction.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Where do you think it goes?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"""Do you think Bob is jealous of our shelter hole""?"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I told you not to mention politics.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I call it the tunnel of love.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,You could have had it all
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I could never live in a high-rise.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Should we tell him about the alternate entrance?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Sure it looks roomy, but how much is the rent?"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I bet it's easier to get over his wall.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,You could have picked someone with a more comfortable crib for a three-way.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He’s going to freeze in there – Fire won’t be invented for another 10,000 years."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's a real Neo-anderthal.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It's just too long a stretch for him to see the light at the end of our tunnel.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I told you we needed another bathroom
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I think it's time we had a little talk with him!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Vent housing is the latest rage.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I can't stand the new high-rises they're building.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It's a modern stone-age bachelor pad.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"We may be out without a trace, but the nitty-gritty knows we're not out of the hole, yet."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,How long do you think it will take him before he notices that we've eloped?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"I'm thinking White Pickett Fence, what are you thinking?"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,You know something? His way might be better when it rains.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,And we're paying for that weekend getaway?!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I told you he was gonna cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Have they gone?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Frankly, Ugh looks down on all his neighbors."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I hate loud upstairs neighbors.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Oog can't afford that... he must be renting ?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Come on in... you can have the hole tub to yourself.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Trust me, with his temper, you want to be in the pit when he realizes the district courts shot down another one of his executive caveman orders."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Our pronunciation at sentencing could probably use some improvement.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I wonder if his place is on Airbnb.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I think they call this a cone of silence.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Grog not quite as busy as you say, Ms. Conway."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It's called the cone of silence
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Well, I'm firm about a square entry."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Just like you..stubborn as a mule.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,We dug all the way through the earth for that?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's still hasn't got over Wilma leaving him.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He refers to it as his ""man cave."""
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Me remember single life as being more fun.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It is perfect. Let's take it. It seems to have a Room with a View.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He thinks the horizontal style is cooler.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Isn't that the same weirdo who claims we evolved from monkeys?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,You'd think he'd be a little happier. He definitely had the better lawyer.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I thought you said if we dug straight through we would end up in China.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,The polls said he had a five-point lead.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,She took absolutely everything when she left him.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He was able to expand after just inventing this thing called a ""Wheel""..."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He's getting better. I give him a 8 for take-off, 9 for technique."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It doesn't much matter; we're all goin' down.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,yes he has his own cave but does he have a wheel?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It's a little brigher up here.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I think he took 'we need to dig more' to mean 'you think I'm fat.'
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Our GPS is just a tiny bit off..
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Ironically, he's the one acting like a stick in the mud."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Maybe we shouldn't have said three is a crowd.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,How can anyone live like that?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I knew our place was a money pit.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It's a new group. Call themselves CAVEMEN.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He voted for moron. Let him dig his own hole.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,His lease expires at the end of the month
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Pretty damn Spartan homeless shelter, if you ask me."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Go ahead make it into an art gallery, see if we care."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,One man shouldn't have such a large nice cave. Perhaps we could eminent domain him.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I find those above-ground caves so tacky
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,We're so much cooler underground.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Wow...he dig hole through rock.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Great, now where are we going to park the Mercedes?"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Charlie always stages a sit-in when the in-laws are in town.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Whatya think? Is he gonna ""Love it or List It?"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Lonely caveman
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He'll never find us in here..

3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I think I like uptown better than downtown!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Be warned, he's pouting about letting females into the cave."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,What's with these people? Living above ground? And calling it progressive?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,OMG! I love this game! We've just hit a one in hole!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Gronk lonely. Gronk push everyone away.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I should have known you guys would try to undermine me again.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Leader Chunk make travel ban, promise border wall, say neighboring Neanderthals pay for it in animal skins. Yet Chunk maintain ice bridge to Russia. Me no like Chunk."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Guess I should have asked for directions....
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,The first man cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Did you tell him about Cavedwellersonly.com?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He think we take him for granite.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Could he be an ICE agent?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's still upset about the Geico commercials.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,...and he insists that we call him a 'cave' man now.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Well, I guess there are holes ---and then there are HOLES."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's never liked fire pits.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He always gets all caveman when he's in a state.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Nice man cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He refuses to come with us because he thinks he's safer from the eruption above ground.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Honey, you have to get over your cave envy."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Honey, I told you to bring along some spare change if we were taking the subway today."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,There's enough room for you too!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"All that digging, for him?!"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"I think it's time for him to get ""un-grounded"""
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,What did the co-op board say he had that we didn't?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Og's house is much nicer than our s**t hole!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Everyone is saying it's a portal to the underworld, but in this pre-truth era, I'm not sure what to believe."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He swore he'd never go in there—then he caved.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I don't see that big of a difference between us and the 10% now.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Ugg is just taking a break, Mr. Rhodes"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He was dragging her by the hair--and her wig came off.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Bunga trying to invent third wheel.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,The wall didn't work. This is an employment program.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Forget him. He's a total troglodyte.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Since when is Pismo Beach inside a cave?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Well, you know a cave is only really just a cave on its side"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Next hill have a fancy cart.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,See... I told you Marvin became the very first person to give up on life and become a hermit!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Roof Hog!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"And as soon as we domesticate the dog, he'll be in the dog house."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He said Survivalism was just Paranoia, do you think he knows about the smoke?"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,When did he get cable?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Grab a drink after the stakeout?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,That is a perfect example of false caves.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Ok, well we'll check on you in 2020"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"There is Clyde getting up in the world, but its still just a studio apartment."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Isn’t it about time he hunted and gathered?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I told him we were thinking of re-inventing the wheel.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"You distract him, and I fetch his TV!"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Nice curb appeal, but could be drafty."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He thinks we have a holier than thou attitude.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Wiretapping the cave would be easier, and he’ll never suspect it."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Why can't we live inn a castle?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Look Barry, that holeman has a man cave."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,You've convinced me. We should upgrade our studio to a one bedroom.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Uh oh, we in the hole."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,If he doesn't learn how to move without her he's a goner.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's not into modular housing.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I think we misheard which hole is to 'sit' in.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Since the last election they've not required much coercion
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,The worst thing is it's rent controlled.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,His cave is just not a good fit with the neighborhood.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Those horizontal tunnelers! So smug!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"See look there's another one, we better keep digging this border trench."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,If he could get out of this hole....
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I would have used Facerock!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"The condo's fine, but I'd love to move up to a full sized house."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I think our neighboorhood is being gentrified.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Gotta love his beard!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Looks like the Man Cave didn't make him happy.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I thought for sure he would cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Darn millennials.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,So ostentatious! I remember when a single-family hole in the ground was good enough for this neighborhood.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Maybe man caves aren't all they're cracked up to be.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I've got a decent proposal
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He will die if he refuses to join us in our meteor-bomb shelter.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Well we could distract him with alternative facts.......
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I hear he is branding it 'Trump Cave'.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He may have better shelter, but I'll be the social isolation will kill him."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Sure, bigger is nice, but then you have the commute."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Oh, it's that kind of bear cave!"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He just sits there reminiscing about the great, old stories on the cave painting wall. He hopes we can be great again."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Nice, yes, but Donnie didn't earn it, he inherited it."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I always knew he'd cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,whoops! It's occupied.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,A high rise....do you think it will catch on?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Honey... Can I have a Man Cave too?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,How do you expect to make it in the world if you sit there all day masturbating to the cave drawings? And that's our only towel!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"All right, here's the plan..."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He lives in a parallel universe....
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,And this is what a five star rating looks like?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He swears he still doesn't regret voting for Trump.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Unless he converts to toad worship no indoor plumbing use allowed.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Me can't believe he voted for cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Seems like the preppers are always one step ahead...
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's in his man cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,President Bannon. He's thinking again.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,That cave must be great when it's raining.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I'm glad tweeting hasn't been invented yet.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,His wife says he's a real caveman.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,'At least we have each other.'
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Look, a literal man cave."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,So what hole do you think he's been living in.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Tell him the hot tub won't have water for 500,000 years."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Do you suppose Obama wiretapped his office too? SAD!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Man cave ground zero.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It's another one of his nutty alternative housing designs.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He said he needs some space, calls it his ""man cave."""
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Do you think your parents will let us move in with them?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,What could be in there that needs a bouncer?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's still all bent out of shape about me taking credit for the wheel.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,If he sees us together he's going to go all caveman.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"I know it's exhausting, but trust me, someday everyone will get around using my subway idea."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Do you think he might rent it to us for an hour?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Well, sure, these horizontal holes are great at keeping the rain out but there's no way he's going to trap a mammoth."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,maybe 'metric' means 'close enough'?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's waiting for his patent on the high-rise.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,When's check-in at our Cavebnb ?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He doesn't believe that the court said he CAN come in!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's still upset about the election.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"He's ""Contemplating"" something."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Gotta keep quiet. He meditates twice a day.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,She went gathering with his best friend.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,It's a shared rental
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Your father has no understanding of the younger generation.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I can see how a closed concept could have its advantages.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Do you still want to move from the inner city?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Let's find another channel. Nothing good to watch here.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I dunno either. Told me he was hoping to flip it!
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Why would anyone want to be in a fox cave?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Ugh. Caveman man cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"""Please don't leave our cozy love nest""."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Generations from now, they will look back on this day as the initial step, that led our species, to alternate world views."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He still thinks we're going to cave in.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Is that the History channel he is watching?
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Yeah Bertha, that looks nice, but let's wait till they come up with the brownstone before we make any offers."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,We need a new real estate agent.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"You would think, in this day and age, that he would be more open-minded."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He probably believes that cause he's living in an echo chamber
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Oh, for Pete's sake!"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He's just a whiny monogamist.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"His place is nice, sure, but at least ours is paid off."
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Now that's what I call living it up.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,"Remind me - are we waiting to see if he sees his shadow, or is he waiting on us?"
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,'I vote we cave in and go for the upgrade'.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Now that’s a man cave.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Looks like our third wheel is out of alignment again.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,He' stuck in his old ways.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Damn progressives.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,I told you they leave the baby alone when they go shopping.
3183,0,1,7,8,1.125,0.1336306209562122,560,Darn rent control.
