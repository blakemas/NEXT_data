667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"I'm leaving you, his is bigger."
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"Honey, you're blowing things way out of proportion."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"Our pool coverage is a covfefe, what you have is a beach ball!"
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Anyone seen Henry? He said he'd be arriving by hot air balloon.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,You think that's big? You should see my noodle.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,WHY?
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Careful! She's very protective of her young.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"Oh, stop whining. Just play in the shallow end."
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,I don't want to be here when it deflates.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"There's a lot more where this came from, babe."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Let's discuss the ball in the room.
667,0,9,40,49,1.183673469387755,0.05589005688828228,572,It conserves water and it's cheaper than a lifeguard.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"Build a wall? Oohhh, I thought he said ""giant beach ball!"""
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"When he told me his was much bigger than mine, I had no idea."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"Sorry, we have a one ball limit in the pool!"
667,0,9,40,49,1.183673469387755,0.05589005688828228,572,Where are the children?
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"Well, one usually is bigger than the other..."
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"Don't worry, the average sized beach ball is 30""."
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Mine's easier to play with.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"First ""he"" sucked all the oxygen out of the room and now he is sucking all the water out of the pool."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I think there's something blocking the pool filter.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Hold this while I jump at the pool.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I guess I'll just take my ball and go home.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,HE SAID THE GAS STATION CHARGED A DOLLAR TO USE THE AIR AND HE USED EVERY PENNY OF IT !!
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,I thought it was BYOB.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,We bought it before we'd decided on the size of the pool.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"They're so cute at that age, I just can't stand it."
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Now let's not make a scene.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Some people just want to make a bigger splash!
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Sure is quiet.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"No, you can't borrow my hair pin."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,These babies expand when wet so if you ever drop one in the toilet run like crazy.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,That's why I hate ordering things online:You never know how it's going to fit!
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,And you were worried we wouldn't fit in.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,The Kaplan's showoffery was never more in force than during their famous neighborhood pool parties.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"You know what they say, size doesn't matter"
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,So much for making a big splash at this party.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,They're so cute when they're young.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"The hot air balloon pilot won the bet, but they are not sure he will survive."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Please tell me that's a hot air balloon that crash landed.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"As usual, no one wanted to talk about the elephant's ball in the pool."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Attention Oz-Land Guests: Would the owner of a 1939 multi-colored hot air balloon with Nebraska plates please report to the pool deck? Your party is waiting for you.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"Ugh, millennials."
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Do you think she’ll attack if we take her baby?
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I'd heard he had an inflated ego.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"Contrary to popular belief Harold, size doesn't matter."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"See Dad, we can have a pool party AND be ""Water Protectors"" also."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I'm not sure I want to be around when he comes after it.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Bigly is always bestly
667,4,1,44,49,1.183673469387755,0.08077783732678857,572,It's health and safety gone mad
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,It was only ten bucks at Costco.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Have you noticed the size of the kids in this neighborhood?
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"Rather obvious, don't you think?"
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,It's because of Trump.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,The cabana boy is never here when we need him.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,I believe your ex is trying to make a point.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"When too many people are spending money too freely, there's a risk of hyperinflation."
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"I like big balls, I cannot lie."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Christo's latest installation
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,There are always a few glitches when you scale up from the prototype.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Christo's latest madcap project.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"Maybe that's why it says ""keep away from water."""
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Now I know how he feels about his hands.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"Yep, I haven't had a kid pee in my pool for years."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Please don’t tell me you bought the sunscreen from Costco too.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Well that took some balls.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,You should see their grill.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Thanks for bringing an offering. She will be pleased.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Guess I should've brought a bottle of wine instead.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"""You should have seen the one that got away""!"
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"Overcompensating, if you ask me."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"No, sadly, that's actually a parachute."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I see the fine print now.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Hyperinflation hit us real hard.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Quit blowing everything out of proportion.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Your dad's already here.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,You should see how big mine gets.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I thought this was a BYOB kind of a party...
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Three months -- but you can already see she takes after her mother.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Keep away. That is a bully ball.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Why do you think this is somehow connected to the pool boy's disappearance?
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Since when do I blow things out of proportion?
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,They're cute when they're little.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I fired the life guard.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"Don't worry, you'll bounce back."
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"Judy, Timmy said he wanted a beach ball sized dinosaur not a dinosaur sized beach ball!"
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Mom said we'd have a ball at the pool.
667,4,1,44,49,1.183673469387755,0.08077783732678857,572,This one's for the toilet tank. My water bill has gone way down.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"The invite read 'BYOB', but this is over the top."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,This is what happens when you put Skittles in a pool full of Coke!
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,It's a Buckminster Fuller pool cover.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,It belongs to that windbag on the third floor!
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,We converted it into a balloon garage.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Nobody asks about the dog anymore.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Size doesn't matter if it's too big to play with.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I see your old boy frend is visiting.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,I found this one escaping around the front.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,"Okay, we'll try yours if the merriment doesn't kick in soon."
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Maybe making beach balls out of spandex isn't such a good idea.
667,3,3,43,49,1.183673469387755,0.07533072989915002,572,It's the President's pool time.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Now I see why there is a limit of one ball per family.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,The diving board is closed today.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,"If size mattered, would I be talking to you?"
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Are you sure this one's ours?
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,Now put that back in the birdbath where you found it.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,Keeping up with the Jones' is getting out of hand.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,It blew over from the Giant's game at AT&T Park
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,We've already got a beach ball.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,You were supposed to tell me when to stop blowing.
667,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,572,I'd say they're just compensating for the small pool.
667,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,572,"Tell me the truth, dear...did I go too Stanley Kubrick on the centerpiece?"
667,0,9,40,49,1.183673469387755,0.05589005688828228,572,"You're watching the kids, right?"

1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,This place has always been over inflated.

1133,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,572,See! You're not the only gay guy at the party.
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,Helium's cheaper then chlorine---that's why.
1133,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,572,See what happens when you don't read the instructions?
1133,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,572,Why yes. I *am* a baller.
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,Inflategate...

1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,Shrinkage? Really?
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,Most overlooked the first clue that the invasion of Lilliput had begun.

1133,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,572,You call that a beach ball?
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,"Honestly, Donnie, size does matter."
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,It keeps our insurance down.
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,I thought you said the ball was in your COURT.
1133,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,572,"It stays inflated longer than yours does, too."
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,Is it too late to cancel the hotdog eating contest?
1133,1,4,36,41,1.146341463414634,0.0658988101761283,572,"I have to be honest. I had a little headache, last night. So, I threw your viagra in the pool."

1133,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,572,Your heated pool actually reverses the shrinkage problem?
1133,2,2,37,41,1.146341463414634,0.07457992610449102,572,They drained the swamp and made a pool

1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I am feeling a bit inadequate.

1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"I must admit, that really is a big beautiful ball."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It's a Claes Oldenburg installation.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Well, I see Gulliver has come back to Lilliput."

1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Well once again, Bob's is larger."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"So we meet again, Stripey McStripeface!"
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,You may as well take your ball and go home.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"I love you, Russell, but the dehydrated beach ball is your worst invention yet."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"OK, bigmouth, out-blow THAT."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,The other one I bought at Mar-a-Lago
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,They got the idea from our tennis club.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Andrew felt the ball envy creeping in.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Don't worry, it's just colder out here."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"And then tomorrow when they wake up, the pool will look much bigger."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It's gender neutral.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"It's just a coincidence. No, I am not from another planet!"
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,have you seen our baby?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I think I finally understand where you fit into the org chart.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,You'll never guess who just rolled in.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,The President must be down for the weekend.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Now that's 'big league'.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Balls, no water."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Its wonderful! We're first in our neighborhood to have one.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Has Anyone Seen My Other Beach Ball ?
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but it's been done before."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Tell the neighbors they'll have to retrieve the ball themselves.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I wish he would take his ball and go home.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I really think you might be blowing this out of proportion
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"I told you, I am not suffering from ball envy."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Sean, dear, Donald's pool parties aren't about the pool..."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,This is what happens when you move in next to a beanstalk.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I don't like the colors.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Have you ever seen a ball full of so much hot air?? Must be Trump's pool.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Waiting for adult swim on the '45.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Argggh, if that Starbuck fella wanders in here, for sure he'll be gettin' a taste of me cutlass"
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"My ball is Bigger than your ball, my ball is bigger than your ball, blah, blah, blah............"
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Who invited Donald and his over inflated ball?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"You're just having a ball, I see."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"I call it...""P-Preventer""."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"It's the biggest, the best, and full of hot air. We're just trying to stay on-trend."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I told you that the little ball is a cheap gift.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"That's nice. So what's the deal with the big rectangular ball in the pool?"" ""It converts your outdoor pool to an indoor pool. There's a door on the other side."" ""Oh."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,It's called a BEACH ball for a reason.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Swell ball, eh?"
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Elephants are so boring.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I'd like to think mine is more practical.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It seems the inflation problem is coming back.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,And I thought bringing one that is in color was enough.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Oh thanks, another one."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,All things being equal- we'll need to refill the pool.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It was a mistake to tell Christo it was BYOB.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Isn't this taking celebrating the LGBTQ community a little too far?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I bought one. All you do is water it.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Just wait till it hatches.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I'm working on the cure for shrinkage.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Ha! I was right. It IS oviparous.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"If it pops, get ready for the National Guard."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Wow. A pool and a ballroom.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"There is only so much weed in the world, Barb. They have to come out at some point."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Still think bigger is better?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"No dear, yours is not the biggest."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Clark just needs to understand that he lives in Smallville now.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,The student has become the master.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I'm overcompensating for WHAT?!?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,This is how you put a round peg into a square hole.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Yes BYOCW means bring your own chlorine-water; everybody knows that Hank.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,But my VC said the idea wasn't scalable!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Once again, Edward's machismo dominates the complex pool scene."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I'm holding all I know. What's in the pool is only what I think I know.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"I admit, when Frank kept saying how big his beach balls were this is not what I envisioned."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Yeah but I heard his never gets fully inflated.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I thought you took your kid off steroids?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,It's not about being pro-equality. It's about needing everyone to know it.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Well, at least that guy is out of breath."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I knew we overfed our other beachball.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Sigmund's pool party
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Just don't let this one get wet.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Hey Bernanke...we decided to use the ball with the real inflation rate.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Not to burst your balloon, but they're fumigating the pool today."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It's the pool party equivalent to the elephant in the room.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,In this case cold water makes it bigger.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"In this case, size matters."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"See, bigger isn't always better."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It looks something like this
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,They shrink that much? I dunno know how you guys walk around with those things.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,What did you think I meant when I said I have big balls?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Ever since the lung transplant Morty loves to show off.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"I ordered a ping-pong ball from Amazon, but they sent King Kong's."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Before they could fully grasp what had happened, they suddenly realized that they should have done a better job of mastering nondimensionalization."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Your one-upmanship might be getting a little out of hand.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,No vacancy.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I adjusted for inflation.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Where's the kiddie pool?
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Do you now understand why I said bigger is not necessarily better?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I'm kicking myself. I could've bought that same size but I didn't think it would fit in the pool.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Don't feel inadequate just because yours isn't the biggest one.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,How is the pilot supposed to exit the balloon?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"I'm leaving you for Harry. Yes, size matters."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I think that poor bastard's bitten off more than he can chew.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Pool is closed due to too much hustle
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Inevitably they all get too big for their beaches.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I made my fortune by stressing scalability.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,So . . . your's is pre-Trump?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I did try to tell you his was bigger...
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,You were right: someone's got it in for you.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I thought it was BYOB.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It was cheaper than hiring a lifeguard.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Rumor has it they added MiracleGro instead of chlorine last night.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,We got tired of kids splashing us.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,He's big into water sports.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Yours is pretty too.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Welcome to Texas!
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"The pool is adults-only, and that includes the toys."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,This is the President's first big ball at Mar-a-Lago!
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"The instructions clearly say, ""Do not over-inflate."""
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,At least we don't need a lifeguard.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I don't know...he hid it in his bathing suit right after eating the bean dip...
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I've never heard of alpha beach balls.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I told you not to water it.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,That's ballsy . . .
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"That's Trump's; essentially, a bag of wind taking up the whole pool."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,We're all on pins and needles over Kathy Griffin's next art installation!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Gosh, Harold sure is doing well for himself."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Trump's in the pool again.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,You should have been here for the splash.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"I was in the pool, I swear!"
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,We need a less creative Safety Committee!
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Ok, everyone outside the tent"
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,This one is called Charlie. He likes beach walks and chew toys.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Forget it. Let's just go home.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I told you his was bigger than yours.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I think we should downsize
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,This is why I said not to invite President Trump to the party!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,That's a couple blocks down. This is the Y.M.C.A.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,That'll keep the kids out.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Political correctness has gone too far!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Wait till you see what I replaced the Hummer with.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It's more evidence for global warming.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Metres, centimetres, whatever…"
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"No really Honey, yours is a good size."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Your hands must be pitifully small.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Water is so passé.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,...but mostly to let them know we have more money.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,But yours has the best motion in the ocean!
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Now let's see if you can do that with a keg of beer.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Sorry, Stan; size does matter."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,These hipster pool floaties sure are getting out of hand...
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Honey, whoever owns that is compensating."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Ok Jerry... the guests are amused & impressed by your, "" Big Balls "" innuendo ..."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I forgot to adjust for inflation.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It's my own personal 'Cocoon'
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Plastic is the new water.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Yes, she did ask for a bigger ball, but this one is too big to play with."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,... and here is the ball that inspired Koons to do the installation.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I've seen bigger.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Any relation?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,At least the miserable brat can't splash in our drinks.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Trust me, our social media consultant says #giantbeachball will bring more guests than the pool."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,You know the whole is always bigger than the sum of its parts.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Awwww, that's all right honey. Cold water always causes shrinkage."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It belongs to the President. He just tweeted that next week he'll announce whether he plans to remove it or not.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Do you know the wifi password?
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,We need some regulations.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Size matters, Henry"
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,The wind must have carried the Miracle Grow from the lawn to the pool.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,You can't say anything. This is a beach ball safe space.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"We did ask our boring city planners to have a ball, but this..."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,that's it! its an anti climate evaporation shield
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Put it down, very carefully; then run for the gate."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,That's God's way of telling us we shouldn't swim.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Turns out they already had a ball.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Many people have told me it is called a covfefe.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Stroke it gently, and it turns into a pool cover."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"In my defense, my therapist thought it was funny."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"I thought the invitation said ""Bring Your Own Beach Ball"""
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Puts a new slant on pooling your resources.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,This party blows.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,The Millers are just so competitive!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It prevents drowning.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Great way to drain the pool at season's end.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Oh dear...You always trying to overcompensate.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,You're allowed to take ONE toy into the pool.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It looks like Paul Bunyon left his beach ball in the pool again.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,You never have measured up.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Who invited the President?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,that is just the tip of Bob's beach ball
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I told you they already had one.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Well, the news copters are annoying, and I found this on the deck this morning."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Trust me, bigger isn't always better."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,That ball trumps ours.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I'm starting to hate the president's visits!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Get the party bucket. Do it now.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Two things: it's alive, and it's afraid of your shish kabob."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Pool boy? No... We've called an Apple Genius!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Sorry, his hands were bigger than yours."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"'""Honey your gift is fine. It's the thought that counts """
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Oh, that guy from Texas just got here."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Costco purchase.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Word is that Trump is a club member. He's headed here and expects to have a ball.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Yeah the guy who inflated it is really full of hot air.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,You can't say colored ball. You have to say rainbow.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Stay a cupple extra nights and it's yours.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Impressive... but what I had in mind was a fancy-dress dance party.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It's normal for one ball to be bigger than the other.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Better water in the pool than advertise you're a fool!
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I thought I was showing my pride.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Well, at least you have the Porsche."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,You just missed him. He and Fay headed into the city to take in the sights.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,We're waiting for the DNA forensics on the inflation stem.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I guess everything IS bigger in Texas.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,It's just a short spell of runaway inflation.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Yes, Fred beat me again, but a Real Man doesn't need a generator to blow up a beach ball."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"When you invited me to the ""Grand Ball, I had something else entirely in mind."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,We've had a Photoshop malfunction.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,It came in a package marked hyuuge.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Does size matter?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Sorry Stan, the invitation said 'bring your pride to our massive gay beach ball party'"
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Ball to the walls baby, ball to the walls."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,See? You CAN get fat eating nothing but air.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,A typical suburban summer weekend gathering at the covfefe.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Mom said I could only one toy.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Actually it's a beach ball.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Sorry but the Trumps arrived here earlier.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"""There's nothing I hate more, than a beachball with an inflated ego."
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"'I'm sorry Kendrick, darling. I'll always love you and your perfectly spherical small beach ball. But can't you see that Jeremy's enormous rectangularity and I were made for each other?'"
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I'm not in this ball-game
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"It's not the size of the ball that matters, honey..."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"Not bad for your last day, eh?"
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Unbelievable! The New Yorker is using color?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I told you it had an evil twin.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I plan to market it as the perfect swimsuit cover up.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Why would you bring a beach ball to a pool party?
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Somebody tell Shaq it's not his day at the pool.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,It's the thought that counts.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Let's blame it on the Fed.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"I'm not gay, I'm just happy."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,"If we are not careful, this beaxh ball is going to result in a beach brawl."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I never thought I'd have beach ball envy.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,The Donald Blew It!

1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I'm canceling our date.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,They'll take it down as soon as they catch the piranha.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,That last guy was a real blowhard.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,I think we've got to tighten our pool toy rules.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,You should see my other beach ball.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,My boyfriend brought a ball too.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Her father is actually a really nice guy. Don't worry, you'll be fine."
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,There is always someone whose possessions have to be bigger than those of anyone else.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Proud is one thing but this is ridiculous!
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Funny, didn't you claim they shrunk in the pool?"
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,I'm suing for copyright infringement.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,and yet you forget the sunscreen?
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,What happened to the diving board?
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,Maybe we should try the smaller one.
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,Should have known! That's Texas for ya'....................
1738,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,572,The pH test indicates that this pool is too basic.
1738,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,572,"Thanks, Harold, but as you can see, Jim's ball is bigger than yours."

3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,But I thought size didn't matter.

3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,It just rolled down a slippery slope.
3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,I think one is enough.
3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,I picked that one up in Brobdingnab.

3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,It's just how the ball bounced.
3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,My husband and I rent because we think we're in a new housing bubble.
3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,Maybe you shouldn't have tossed around its baby.
3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,This pride movement is really blowing up
3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,I guess this is what it means to win bigly.
3784,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,572,It's my husband's way of showing off his big balls.
