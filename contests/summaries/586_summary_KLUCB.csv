752,8,14,78,100,1.3,0.0611340636419152,586,I'd have thought they'd at least come in a Dyson.
752,3,24,73,100,1.3,0.05222329678670935,586,I hear it comes with a hundred thousand-light-year warranty.
752,4,22,74,100,1.3,0.054122942725732585,586,I thought life under Trump sucked.

752,6,18,76,100,1.3,0.05773502691896258,586,Their new ship really sucks
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,Somehow I expected more advanced technology...

752,4,22,74,100,1.3,0.054122942725732585,586,Is this what they mean by the vacuum of space?
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,"Don't worry, it's an Amazon drone making returns."

752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,I'm having a hard time believing they came all this way just to take the dog hair of our pants.

752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,They're back. Apparently we've made quite a mess of things.
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,I thought nature abhors a vacuum !
752,3,24,73,100,1.3,0.05222329678670935,586,"It makes a giant, sucking sound."
752,8,14,78,100,1.3,0.0611340636419152,586,Take us to the carpet of your leader.
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,Electrolux finally got a military contract
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,"Apparently, they have come to believe that dog poop is a valuable commodity based on how quickly we bag it off the sidewalk."
752,6,18,76,100,1.3,0.05773502691896258,586,"Like Nature, Fido abhors a vacuum."
752,6,18,76,100,1.3,0.05773502691896258,586,"""Vacuum me up, Scotty"" just doesn't have the same ring to it..."
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,Get the one in front - he must be their leader!
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,"When they said that space is a vacuum, I didn't take them literally!"
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,I told you we should have brought the pooper scooper.
752,6,18,76,100,1.3,0.05773502691896258,586,"Gee, building a wall seems even dumber now."
752,4,22,74,100,1.3,0.054122942725732585,586,I always knew an alien invasion would suck.
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,It isn't just nature that abhors it
752,6,18,76,100,1.3,0.05773502691896258,586,Huh... I'd expect it to look more like a Roomba.
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,"Do you think he was right about the garbage truck, too?"
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,That must be the vacuum that Nature abhors.
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,"You can have my wife, but I'm keeping the dog!"
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,This was it...The day Fido spent his entire life preparing for...
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,"He always barks at vacuums and strangers, but I'm really with him this time."
752,5,20,75,100,1.3,0.05595813731096785,586,"Wow, it's cordless."
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,I'm guessing it's a Hoovercraft.
752,8,14,78,100,1.3,0.0611340636419152,586,"Yes, I suppose this is ironic."
752,8,14,78,100,1.3,0.0611340636419152,586,This should be less painful than the upholstery attachment.
752,3,24,73,100,1.3,0.05222329678670935,586,I guess they want to clean up the mess before they take over.
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,Their next stop is Uranus
752,7,16,77,100,1.3,0.059458839001056314,586,Maybe the cat was on to something all along.

805,6,17,75,98,1.2959183673469388,0.05839782396079194,586,I guess Ross P. was wrong. That's the giant sucking sound.

1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Just another Trump strategy to round up and deport aliens.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,It's your turn to change the bag.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,"Wow! They were serious when they said ""clean up after your dog "" !"
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Is that how you pictured the vacuum of space?
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Help us change the filter.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Where's the baggie?!
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,It's just the pooper scooper service.
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,It looks like an identified flying object.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,The White House is over there!
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,"I accept that the White House is less predictable each day, but that’s a poor excuse for a wall.”"
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"The resale value isn't much, but it gets amazing mileage."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"Doris, this really sucks."
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,Quick! Under the giant couch!
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,That reminds me -- the housekeeper can't come till Wednesday this week.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,I knew Dyson was developing a new car but this this is a complete surprise.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"Resistance is futile Buddy. Surrender meow, er... now."
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,What's that giant sucking sound?
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,"What do you mean, no one ever told you outer space is a vacuum?"
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"For their sake, I sure hope they have a HEPA filter!"
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,Some people live in a vacuum.
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,"Great, we don't have to clean up after the dog."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,That Elon Musk just keeps getting weirder.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,You must evacuate NOW!
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Do you really think they'll come back after they change bags?
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,"In space, it's just one giant vacuum."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Look at that—a relic of the Hoover administration!
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,Is this your idea of sweeping me off my feet?!
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,Don't panic--it's not plugged in.
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,"You know, I'm fine with Amazon just delivering to our house."
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,Take me to your cleaner
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,Do not say any thing dirty.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,This pooper scoop drone app? Was it a free download?
1519,0,16,53,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05117930441535766,586,I always said vacuuming would be the death of me.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"Quick, get under the sofa."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,You'd think they would have started in Puerto Rico.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,This will be a long ride. Hope there's a new bag.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"I've heard that cleanliness is next to godliness, but this is ridiculous."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Look! The vacuum of space!
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,"Gee, Bob, I knew those budget cuts to EPA were deep, but this is ridiculous."
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Looks like the Mayor is making good on his promise to clean up the city.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,This job REALLY sucks
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,"Forget it, Zork. You know I'm a cat person."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,I told you to bring a bag.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,"Fear not, Earthlings! Our probes are covered under the Alien Care Act."
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,It's the Clean Air Act!! Clean AIR!!
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"See, little clean men really do exist."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"Sorry, we don't know where Mr. Dyson lives."
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,So that's why space is a vacuum.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Let's hope a vacuum doesn't abhore nature.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,I thought Tuesdays was sidewalk cleaning.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,He hates vacuum cleaners.
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,"Ahhh! So that's what the Hoover guys meant when they said that their newest model would be ""out of this world."""
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,I told you there was a vacuum in outer space!
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,The couple on the side walk looks like they need a lift.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,"Dude, I don't think those are dust bunnies."
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Well there goes the neighborhood.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Let's take a knee and get the President involved.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Maybe this is what Fido was trying to warn us about
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"Well Mildred, It looks like this day is gonna suck!"
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,But it's not a Bissell.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,The stories about alien absuction are real!
1519,0,16,53,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05117930441535766,586,"Makes sense, with the ozone going, someone has to come in and clean up after us."
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,I understand their planet is the cleanest one in the galaxy.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,"Somehow, this isn't how I pictured the Rapture."
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Hoovercraft just seems a more apt term.
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,Run Spot run!
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Take us to your mop.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Look! Aliens from a galaxy bed bath and beyond!
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,People of Earth surrender at once or we will scare your dog to death!
1519,6,4,59,69,1.2318840579710144,0.0719504409817834,586,And we've been worrying about cleaning up after our DOG?
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,I TOLD you this city takes dog poop seriously!
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,I would have thought that with higher intelligence they would have gotten away from the canister model.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,I didn’t know that a Hoover could hover like that!
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,"I told you we should bring our own 'pooper scooper."""
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,"Cordless is nice, but can it handle dog hair?"
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,I knew it. They think the dogs are in charge.
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,Don't they know that on this planet Nature abhors a vacuum?
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,Take us to to your cleaners.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,The small one looks tender.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Stop barking Fido. Don't be afraid. There's nothing in space but a vacuum.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,As expected the Dyson space program has backfired.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,I expected the rapture to be more rapturous than this.
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,I told you to stop using the word 'suck'
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,We come to clean your streets.
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,"They're looking for loose change."""
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,I told you the instructions said we should Hover over Earth not Hoover.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,How long do we have to wait until he poops?
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,"Thanks, but Daisy's a Labradoodle, so she doesn't shed."
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,They said space is a vacuum.
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,That looks like it has a great HEPA filter.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,It must have come from the vacuum of space
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,It's not the noise that freaks her out. She's been trying to warn us!
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,This could really suck.
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Now that's what I call a pooper scooper!
1519,1,14,54,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05518676163669498,586,Hoovering isn't what it used to be.
1519,4,8,57,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06575979804152392,586,Relax Dabney. It's just a Hoovercraft.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Where's Ross Perot when we need him?
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,They said they would come back with another ship to pick us up. This must be it.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Looks like we picked a good walk to forget our plastic bag.
1519,3,10,56,69,1.2318840579710144,0.06243471453411533,586,Oh no! We'll be sucked into the vacuum of space!
1519,2,12,55,69,1.2318840579710144,0.05892228881714398,586,Vacuum technology these days has gone way beyond the Dyson ball!
1634,2,12,56,70,1.2285714285714286,0.05816884316617732,586,It's the Martians' low-tech way of collecting Earth samples.
1634,2,12,56,70,1.2285714285714286,0.05816884316617732,586,There's no outlet!
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,Always clean before you move into a new place.
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,The little one will go right through the HEPA filter.
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,"Quick, under the couch!"
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,Where were these guys when Irma came through here?
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,Greetings from the vacuum of space.
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,They take the 'please clean up after your pet' sign seriously
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Don't be scared, Scotty. They seem friendly."
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Our dog ""Nature"" abhors a vacuum"
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,I miss the probes
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,It's that new Dyson flying car.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"We should never have sent them ""The Lucy Show."""
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,I told you aliens will treat us like dirt.
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,And I thought vacuum in space meant something entirely different.
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"New form of tax collection, maybe?"
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,"Look, Marge, I'm with Buddy on this one. Some of these new green initiatives really suck."
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,I thought nature abhors a vacuum !
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,Wireless is definitely the way to go.
1636,5,5,57,67,1.2238805970149254,0.0699579751164994,586,I knew Richard Dyson would turn on humanity someday.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Wait, today is alternate-side."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,I'll bet life on their planet really sucks!
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,That Elon Musk thinks of everything!
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,"Quiet Hoover, we told you this would happen some day!"
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,The one on the leash is the smartest. Take her.
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,One million light-years and we're still on the first bag
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,I guess this is why they removed the doggie waste bag dispensers.
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,Bet you can't eat just one.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,So much for the rumored sightings of alien spacecraft shaped like upright vacuum cleaners.
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,"Boarding should be easy, but I’m guessing there’s not much legroom."
1636,0,15,52,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05130982469793496,586,Ross Perot was wrong!
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"Enough with ""It sucks."" Just move on, Jerome."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"You know, it's days like this that I just feel like a speck in the universe."
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,Advanced? You'd think they'd have something more aerodynamic like a Roomba.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,These aliens suck.
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,Let’s just hope they changed the bag recently.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,Suck or blow?
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,"Did you practice your ""Klaatu barada nikto""?"
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Oh, wow. This really sucks."
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Humans, this your Electrolux canister captain. Prepare for transport to the 1950s."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,Something's upsetting the dog.
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,So what if I can't spell armageddon. It's not the end of the world.
1636,5,5,57,67,1.2238805970149254,0.0699579751164994,586,"Well, they can't be Buddhists....too many attachments"
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,I told you going out on a day like this would suck!
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,I don't know- who was the first director of the FBI? What brings that up?
1636,0,15,52,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05130982469793496,586,That's odd -- I always pictured the vacuum of space as bigger.
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"Sunbeam them up, Scottie."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"Look, someone's finally draining the swamp!"
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"The Space X, Tesla and Dyson merger certainly helped clean up the city streets."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"Relax, they grabbed the small attachment."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,We already live in a vacuum.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Suck it, humans."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"What do you mean, of course I don't know what it is."
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,Great! The one time we forget to bring plastic bags with us.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,They're taking us to the cleaners!
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,I told you to change the bag before we left Mars!
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,"How dare you. They're ""undocumented life forms."""
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,"Finally, someone to clean up this mess."
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Xzorjg, we'll use the upright for Central Park, but the canister works better on flat surfaces."
1636,5,5,57,67,1.2238805970149254,0.0699579751164994,586,"Quick, see if you have any lint in your pocket."
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,Aliens from the Hoover Administration.
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,They really exist in a vacuum.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Oh, so that's what they mean by the vacuum of space..."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,It looks like we won't need to pick up after Fido after all
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"Our witches ride broomsticks, theirs ride vacuums. We're not so different after all!"
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,People don't realize that nobody here is willing to take those jobs.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,I told you it was ‘alien absuction’ and not abduction!
1636,0,15,52,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05130982469793496,586,"Well, this is gonna suck."
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,Don't worry Fido. Planet Dyson takes good care of its immigrants.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,Maybe it won't suck.
1636,0,15,52,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05130982469793496,586,They requested a major clean-up on this planet
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"The agent misunderstood. I said 'hovercraft,' not 'hoovercraft.'"
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,It's the new Boeing-Electrolux bomber. It cleans up the debris it creates.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,I told you we'd get in trouble if you left the doggie do on the sidewalk.
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,I guess nowhere is safe from the vacuum of space.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,Looks like it's sweep's-week on Alpha Centauri.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Scoop the poop, Siri, not the pup."

1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,Another of life's mysteries is revealed.
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,These people aren't very friendly. He said the world abhors a vacuum!
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,The one in front is obviously the leader. Take him.
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,Scientists say that space is one big vacuum.

1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,I told you an alien invasion was going to suck.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,We need to give them directions to Washington DC.
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,Prepare to enter the infinite vacuum of space
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,"Well ftankly, I didn't see that coming!"
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,The dominant species must be the one leading the two subspecies.
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,"DACA aside, he wanted to keep some aliens as domestics."
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,Just when you think the world couldn't suck more ....
1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,"Oh My God, an Unidentified Hoovering Object."

1636,1,13,53,67,1.2238805970149254,0.055542615574947524,586,I thought the vacuum of space was just an expression
1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,"""Honey, dont look now but I think they've spotted us. Do you think it's because Pedro doesn't bark in English""?"

1636,2,11,54,67,1.2238805970149254,0.05947492059078339,586,Since when were motorized vehicles allowed in the park?
1636,3,9,55,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06316288636259094,586,I guess outer space really is just a big vacuum.
1636,4,7,56,67,1.2238805970149254,0.06664708731840546,586,Finally! An answer for the pollen.

2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"Relax, we're just in Fido's worst nightmare."
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,I guess they've moved from saucers to small electrical appliances.

2926,1,4,39,44,1.1363636363636365,0.06161077006722115,586,I guess Trump hired out of this world cheap labor cost to drain the swamp.
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,That thing sucks.
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"I suppose it's a visual pun for ""the vacuum of space""."
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,My worst fears have come true

2926,1,4,39,44,1.1363636363636365,0.06161077006722115,586,"It reminds me of when they used to sell those door-to-door. The salesman would throw junk on the floor, then suck it up. The dog always barked like crazy. I haven't thought of that in years."
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,Don't worry Martha. This is just United Airlines's way of recruiting passengers.

2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,Do they really think we live in a vacuum?
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"Ethyl, Maurice and their dog Rip just disappeared into the vacuum of space and time."
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,Our poor little Poopsie barks at EVERYTHING!
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"No barking, Max. They pick up after you too."
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"Somehow, I don't want to shout, ""Eureka, it's space aliens."""

2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,Even the Martians are sucking up to Trump.
2926,1,4,39,44,1.1363636363636365,0.06161077006722115,586,Didn't I say the toasters were just the beginning?
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,Look! It's one of them new Hoovercraft

2926,1,4,39,44,1.1363636363636365,0.06161077006722115,586,"I told you to stop saying ""suck it up""!"
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"No, we cannot take you to our leader. I can give you directions to the nearest Buddy’s Discount Carpet."
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"You never know what Global Warming will come up with next, amiright?"
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,"Someone's taking ""the vacuum of space"" a little too literally."
2926,2,2,40,44,1.1363636363636365,0.06966325746551968,586,You guys suck.
2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,...and thus the total annihilation of earth by the alien invaders was thwarted.

2926,0,6,38,44,1.1363636363636365,0.05233358898302985,586,I guess the Mayor really meant it when he pledged to clean up this neighborhood.
2926,1,4,39,44,1.1363636363636365,0.06161077006722115,586,Evolution has changed the drones much faster than it did the animals.
