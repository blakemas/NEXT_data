1,3,1,0,4,2.75,0.28867513459481287,516,If I am lying then let God strike me dead!
1,3,1,0,4,2.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm told the coffee here is to die for.
1,3,1,0,4,2.75,0.28867513459481287,516,You know that artificial sweetener will kill ya.
5,2,1,0,3,2.6666666666666665,0.408248290463863,516,The wife said her lawyer would be dropping something off today...
5,2,1,0,3,2.6666666666666665,0.408248290463863,516,There is nothing worse than paying five dollars for coffee
5,2,1,0,3,2.6666666666666665,0.408248290463863,516,In construction it's the overhead that kills you.
8,4,0,1,5,2.6,0.4000000000000002,516,How many lumps did you say you wanted again?
9,2,2,0,4,2.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Good news. I got my cholesterol down below 200.
9,2,2,0,4,2.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I mean, what's the worst that could happen?"
9,3,0,1,4,2.5,0.5,516,This café is always hit or miss.
9,2,2,0,4,2.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm being terminated.
9,3,0,1,4,2.5,0.5,516,Roses. Why?
14,3,1,1,5,2.4,0.39999999999999997,516,So far the divorce has been surprisingly civil.
14,3,1,1,5,2.4,0.39999999999999997,516,I'm learning to just live in the moment.
16,2,0,1,3,2.3333333333333335,0.6666666666666669,516,Is there time for a cappuccino?
16,1,2,0,3,2.3333333333333335,0.408248290463863,516,My LDL is a little high.
16,2,0,1,3,2.3333333333333335,0.6666666666666669,516,"Tell me, can this day get any worse?"
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Wait. It'll come to me in a second.
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I will e-mail your raise and the promotion to HR this afternoon.
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My friends call me Lucky.
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, what's the BAD news?"
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,Let's order dessert first!
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,And that's when it hit me!
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,I just scored tickets to 'Hamilton.'
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Overhead is killing us.
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,I've been having an affair with the wife of a cartoonist.
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I specifically requested a second lump.
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,"So thanks for the lunch, but I just don't need any more life insurance."
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,Remember when flying toaster screensavers were cool?
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,I'm convinced the link between caffeine and headaches is inconclusive.
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,It's actually been a nice little Monday.
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The divorce was very amicable. Why do you ask?
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,"Duck? No, I ordered roast beef."
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I quit eating pastrami. That stuff will kill you.
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,"Then it struck me, I should be a personal injury lawyer!"
19,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,516,"Yes, that IS my final answer."
19,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,516,There's really nothing worse than bad coffee.
39,2,2,1,5,2.2,0.37416573867739417,516,Nothing could make this day worse for me.
39,2,2,1,5,2.2,0.37416573867739417,516,"I'm telling you, our infrastructure is crumbling. It's a wonder no one gets hurt."
39,2,2,1,5,2.2,0.37416573867739417,516,Did you know that UPS has started testing Delivery Drones for its deliveries to Construction Sites?
39,3,0,2,5,2.2,0.48989794855663565,516,I need concrete evidence that she's cheating on me.
39,2,2,1,5,2.2,0.37416573867739417,516,I'll be brief.
39,2,2,1,5,2.2,0.37416573867739417,516,"You mean that figuratively, of course."
39,1,4,0,5,2.2,0.22360679774997896,516,But at least I have my health.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Relax, Chicken Little."
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Carl is completely oblivious to the best selfie moment he will ever have.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,Nope. Definitely don't want to switch seats.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"If there is a God, she's a blockhead."
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Bill, your problem is that you always act as if the sky is falling."
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,May God drop a cinderblock on my head if I am lying.
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Whatever. It's just a cartoon.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Yeah, I walk under ladders. So what?"
46,1,3,1,5,2.0,0.31622776601683794,516,"Well, I think it's about time for me to go."
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Yeah, the stars are lined up on this one."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Yes, I designed this building--but I don't consider it my best work."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,It was the worst thing that ever happened to me.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"You know you shouldn't eat that junk, right?"
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Finally, I can retire!"
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,Sometimes diet and exercise just isn't enough.
46,2,1,2,5,2.0,0.4472135954999579,516,Any final thoughts?
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I'm changing my will tomorrow and leaving everything to you.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,We've gotta go. I get the feeling it's crunch time.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,How's your little chicken sandwich?
46,1,3,1,5,2.0,0.31622776601683794,516,This very well could be the Cubs' year.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I dunno. There must be some metaphor for a Trump presidential win.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"I was considering how we might cut building costs, and then it hit me!"
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,The NFL is right. How do you really know if you got a concussion?
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I don't see how today could get any worse.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I wish there was a way to guarantee that I don't outlive my retirement savings.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,So let me tell you about this horrible day I've had.
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Writer's block? I don't believe in it. Why do you ask?
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,The worst part is not knowing when the other shoe is going to drop.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I'm only a block away
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,This time I ordered it with crushed ice.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,How many lumps did you ask for?
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Oh, good, you see it, too."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"I'm really feeling groggy today, I hope this coffee gives me a jolt."
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Did your chair have an X on it, too?"
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I'm sure the other shoe will fall soon enough.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,So you never suffered from writer's block?
46,0,4,0,4,2.0,0.28867513459481287,516,It'll come to me in a second.
46,0,4,0,4,2.0,0.28867513459481287,516,"You're right, I need to stop worrying and start living."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I've always made sure I'm in the right place at the right time.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"The doc said to cut out the fat, sweets, and carbs, take a brisk walk four times a week, start a daily Mindfulness practice, and I will live a long and healthy life."
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,You might want to reconsider your blasphemy.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Deep down inside, I guess I'm an optimist."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,You ever feel like things just hit you out of the blue?
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Where’s the thrill, Bob? Where’s the excitement?"
46,2,1,2,5,2.0,0.4472135954999579,516,I wish there were a way to block everything out of my head.
46,1,3,1,5,2.0,0.31622776601683794,516,One lump or two...
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Did we forget to tip the last time we were here?
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I'm headed for the graveyard shift
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"'So I said to my insurance agent, What are the odds of THAT happening?'"
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"The problem is that idealists like you, Walter, seldom offer a single, concrete idea."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"i think my smart watch is broken, it just says duck"
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,Duck? Yeah--It's excellent here.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,You never look at me anymore when I'm talking to you.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Quick question: any last words?
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"""Do you think it's risky if I blow off the block party?"
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,Do we have time for dessert?
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,``Sorry if I sound negative. Things are actually going pretty good.''
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,Before I tell you where I buried the treasure....
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Pass the mortar.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,It all makes sense now.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,One last thought...
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,This French Onion soup will be the death of me.
46,0,4,0,4,2.0,0.28867513459481287,516,"I took care of the bricklayers union, no prob"
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Uhhh...forget the WRITER'S block...
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Sales are down, but its not like the roofs caving in"
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Oddly enough, we finished the building with a few materials unaccounted for."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I want your honest opinion. Do you think I'm paranoid?
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,You got any aspirin? I feel a massive headache coming on.
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,And since I'm the only one who knows your little secret...
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I've decided to apologize to Putin.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Well, I'm voting for Trump."
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"""Impactful?"" What does that even mean?"
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Decent offer, but the horoscope today said I should be more hardheaded."
46,0,4,0,4,2.0,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think I was too hard on the waitress?
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Tip? I've been coming here 10 years, this exact seat - never tipped."
46,2,1,2,5,2.0,0.4472135954999579,516,My doctor says caffeine will kill me. I think he's wrong.
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,And the last thing I want to say is ...
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"Seriously, can you think of anything less likely than Donald Trump becoming President?"
46,0,4,0,4,2.0,0.28867513459481287,516,Mind not drumming your fingers on the table like that? Going to give me a headache.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I'm having the Special
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Listen, life insurance is obsolete."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I don't think they serve duck here...
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I think my wife is having an affair with a mason...
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,It's the overhead that's gonna kill me
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I'm serious-- that fast food is going to kill you.
46,1,3,1,5,2.0,0.31622776601683794,516,I always take one lump with my coffee.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Don't move.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,No. I don't believe I care for duck.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,...and the overhead could kill us.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,O.K.....I'll pick up the tab next time.
46,0,4,0,4,2.0,0.28867513459481287,516,Shouldn't we both be concerned about overhead?
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Sure, we can leave anytime. Why?"
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,Let me give you a concrete example.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,The next one's on you.
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I'm probably just being paranoid.
46,1,1,1,3,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,"My life's never been better, but I'm just worried other shoe's going to drop."
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,Don't you know that stuff will kill you?
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,My eyes are down here.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I should have ordered something lighter.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,I'm proud to say I got this place built three months ahead of schedule and at thirty-five percent below budget.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,My doctor told me to stop worrying.
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,It's good to be alive.
46,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,516,"Downsized from work, Jill wants a divorce... It makes you wonder what might be next."
46,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,516,I'm thinking about cutting back on the caffeine.
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,How does my hair look?
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,MetLife. Why do you ask?
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,They were out of donuts. How can this day get any worse?
150,0,4,1,5,1.8,0.22360679774997896,516,I just finally feel like things are becoming more concrete.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,I don't know what to do - she just keeps dropping these things on me out of nowhere.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,I'd give anything to get out of this project.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"... but all in all, I have to say that things are looking up."
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"I'm gonna need you to be my eyes and ears on this one, Bill."
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,"Yes, it was a little strange last night. All the fortune cookie said was, ""Look Up!!"""
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"What do ya mean, ""Problem solved""?"
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,So where are we at in our lawsuit against Looney Tunes?
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,"Like you said, it happens."
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"I could swear I saw my first wife, in a hard hat, go upstairs."
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,At least I have my health.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"I forgot to mention, I sign the life insurance papers tomorrow."
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"No really, I have the worst luck."
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,"I was just fired , now what?"
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,...interesting question... is there anything super quick to do on my bucket list...
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,My wife's latest hobby has been estate planning.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,I feel more validated now that my wife increased my life insurance.
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,"Then she said, ""You're always so clueless."""
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,Sometimes I think things can't get any worse.
150,0,4,1,5,1.8,0.22360679774997896,516,You might want to move your cell phone.
150,0,4,1,5,1.8,0.22360679774997896,516,They take it personal if you don't leave a big enough tip
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,Nothing wakes me up like that first cup of coffee.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"It's more than a job. For me, risk management is a calling."
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,They promised a counter offer before noon.
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,"...So after two disastrous marriages, my job being terminated and the BMW being totaled, I think I'm finally out of the woods..."
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"Just once I'd like to receive a ""heads up"" about something ahead of time."
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,I'll get the check!
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,It's time you quit interrupting me.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,That's my final offer!
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,I swear that this is the last day I am eating here.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,I think the management welcomed my criticism of the macchiato.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"Well, Richard, it looks like I actually won’t be firing you today."
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,"I built this place for $200,000 under our bid."
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,The coffee here is to die for.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,So I can finally enjoy a nice restaurant for lunch now that I've cancelled my life insurance premium.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,Why are you surprised I fired that coyote from the ACME group.
150,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,516,I heard this place is known for its flat white.
150,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,516,I hear too much caffeine can kill you.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"I'm not so sure ""getting them to pay for that wall"" was such a good idea."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I pray to God someone cures my migraine.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Then I told my agent that I need more life insurance like I need a hole in the head.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I told the barista to surprise me
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,This building is my legacy.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I just came back from my annual check up ..doc says i'll live to be a hundred.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I don't think you fully grasp the gravity of the situation.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Let me think about that for a minute.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,So I skip the tip and tell her she's one brick shy of a load.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I have discovered the identity of God and the true meaning of life in...
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I can't believe this. I asked for two lumps with my coffee.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Ironically, I feel a great weight has been lifted from me."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,This place never fails to surprise you.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Just once, I wish a lunch meeting would end with something concrete."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,You move! I'm perfectly comfortable.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"I just read that gravity is just a scientific theory, not an actual law."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I feel like that dark cloud over my head has finally left."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, not writer's block, I think it's something else."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,What's the worst-case scenario?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,They say coffee's actually good for you -- it's the sugar you have to watch out for.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Losing that client isn't the end of the world.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"So she says, 'one lump or two?'"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I'd give anything not to have to go back to the office.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I love this place. Everything’s half off during the remodel.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Life is...
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Finally signed the will yesterday.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Either I get a concrete proposal from these guys or I'm out!
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,An extra coffee break never killed anyone.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,We need a blockbuster.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't believe you use artificial sweetener. That stuff will kill you.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,My best ideas hit me like a ton of bricks.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Fortunately, she seems very amicable about the divorce."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Thanks again for changing seats with me.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"As long as there's no second panel, I'll be fine."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm serious, Bob, I think someone's trying to kill me."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I wish my luck would change
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I'd better be getting home before it rains.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Damn! She made my skinny latte with 2%.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"I know that worried look, Fred, but save it for after lunch, okay?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,You can only imagine the stress that I'm under.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"What, like another cup of coffee's gonna kill me?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"For the first time in my life, I'm in love."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,It can't get any worse!
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm wondering what will hit next.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,32 feet per second per second. Why?
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"And today, I pick up my big fat Lotto check."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"Oh, don't worry about it. My horoscope says today's my lucky day!"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Couldn't you be more concrete
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Something tells me I'm not gonna make partner.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Don't worry, this one's on me."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"We've come up with some preliminary ideas, but nothing concrete, yet."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"I eat sensibly, I don't smoke or drink, and I have the blood pressure and metabolism of a teen-ager."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I feel like I'm in a loony tunes cartoon.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"The contracts are signed, what can possibly go wrong?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"So I decided to rebuild my life, brick by br —"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I think the worst is over.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I'm not leaving a tip. Karma shmarma.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Accident insurance, why do you ask?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Well, God strike me down if I'm wrong, but I think he really will make America great again."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,JUST SIGN IT.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,What did you order for dessert?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"All I know is that between getting fired and Mary leaving me, I don't think I can handle another crushing blow."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,just give me something concrete to go on...
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,It's all about knowing when the next big thing is gonna hit.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"If I don't cement this deal soon, my boss will knock my block off!"
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"So anyway, my point is, you are the master of your fate."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"..she says she will build one. He says he won't build one. But I tell ya, what we really need, is a sign from above."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,There was something in today's horoscope that I definitely don't understand.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I never tip here
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Maybe you're right. Maybe I should stop being so pessimistic.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,If only God would give me a sign that I'm doing the right thing...
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Last night I solved the Goldbach conjecture.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,It's gonna be an Excedrin kind of day.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,We were lucky to get a table.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"I'm sorry Bill, there's just no openings right now at the firm"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,No one EVER notices the severed finger on the table...
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,What I'm about to tell you will change the world.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I've been lucky. I've never experienced writer's block.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Which is the better deal, term insurance or whole life?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Grow up Johnson, I'm not falling for that old, made you look, made you look gag"
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I'd give anything to not have to go back to work today.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Things are looking up, Bob. I've finally gotten over the divorce, the cancer is in remission, and I've had some very promising job interviews."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,At least I've still got my faith.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"So, how do you like the Karma Cafe?"
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Can you believe it ... fired before lunch. How can today get any worse?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Do you hear a slide whistle?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I think we are getting a gentle hint to vacate the table!
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,The coffee at this place is to die for.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Thank you for making me your beneficiary
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Yes, I think she took it pretty well, but you know Marcie, it is hard to read her face at the best of times"
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I call tails
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I ordered the chef's surprise whatever that is.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I mean... put yourself in my place.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"Duck? No, I'm leaning toward the chicken."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't see how this day could possibly get any worse.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"When she left this morning I asked myself: ""what could be worse ?"""
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Karma schmarma.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,What on Earth did you say to that coyote?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I really hope something comes my way soon.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,The way things have gone for me lately I don’t see how there could be anything bad left to happen to me.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I always sit here. It's my lucky table.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,You will not believe the week I've had.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,"Normally, I wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this!"

192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm gonna be crushed if I don't get that promotion.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Ever get the feeling that it's just going to be one of those days?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,And I told that Fortune Teller that I wasn't going to pay her because it was imposs....
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"My investments are up, my cholesterol is down... things are starting to fall into place."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Any idea why they call it “The Sadist’s Surprise Café”?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Yeah, but moving is such a headache."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I didn't tip the barista. Why do you ask?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"The thing is, people never think about infrastructure until it impacts them directly."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I switched to decaf for my health.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"For once, give me something concrete."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"my attorney guarantees a simple, concrete solution"

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Did I tell you I finally paid off my student loans?
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Just once I wish you'd let me have the last word
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Mark my words, all this doomsday talk just has to stop."

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,What do I have to do to get you to look at me when I'm talking?

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Do you want to know what my horoscope said today?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"""Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head"" -- that song is driving me crazy."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Im sorry our cutbacks at OSHA affected you.

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"So you're not laying me off, after all?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Nice try, Jeff. April fool."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"And then it hit me, the meaning of life is..."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Next time, my treat."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Ever have one of those days?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"No, theoretical physics will have a much greater impact than applied physics."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,They know me here. I don't even bother to tip anymore.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I think my wife is cheating on me.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Why the long face?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Could you provide me with something more concrete?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"It's been such a good week, I keep looking over my shoulder."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Hypotheticals won't work here. The boss wants something concrete.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,And that's my final word on the subject!
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I need for you to understand that I'm running out of time.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"You know, it still hasn't hit me that I won the lottery this morning."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I would have settled for the other shoe.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I think you should cancel your 2 o'clock.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Yes, my name is Chick Little, why do you ask?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Today I decided to start working out.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Life's too short to be worrying about everything.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Actually since going vegan I feel so much better.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"I've never felt better in my life, why?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I think I'm going to start eating healthier.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Got any concrete ideas?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Great business; but its the overhead that kills you!
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Say what?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"You know, I just have this lucky feeling."

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I think they took my complaint quite seriously
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Would it hurt to ask for one concrete solution to my problems?
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,And then it literally hit me...
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I'd get that coffee to go...
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,You never look at me when I'm talking.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I'm sick of waiting for a sign from the universe.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I mean it. I really don't see how this day could get any worse.

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I wouldn't worry about the sales figures.

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I want to be more open-minded.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,You have to listen because I am not going to repeat myself.

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,This interview is over.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"For once, I'm going to pick up the tab."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"For the last time, Felix, look at me when I'm talking to you!"
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,There's never a good time to talk about life insurance.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I need hard evidence before I act.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"The last supper. That's an odd name for a restaurant, right?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,Put yourself in my place.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"You never know, you could get hit by a bus"

192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I just don't feel like I have a future here
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,And I finally paid off my student loan this week.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,It's a no-brainer.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Yes, double indemnity. Why do you ask?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I asked for one lump.

192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I've got to stop waiting for the other shoe to drop.
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,I like your position on this one.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"I just need one concrete idea , just one !"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"You know, Frank, I don't know how this week could get any worse."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"So, if we can just steer clear of the unforeseen..."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,You ever think about just not going back to work after lunch?
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think the mob works weekends?

192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,I'd do anything to get out of that meeting.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"So, worst case scenario, what do you foresee?"
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,""" I just don't seem to be able to get out from under""."
192,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,516,Eat up. They discourage lingering.
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,"Ok, so....big deal, God plays dice with the universe."
192,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,516,He was paying for lunch.
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,Believe it or not but I'll get the check this time.

414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,"Do we have time to eat or should we take it ""to go""?"
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,I feel like the whole world is crumbling around me.

414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,Too abstract. Let's try for something a little more concrete.
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"...and not only is he my true idol, I think Trump is downright sexy."

414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,I just feel I need something more concrete
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,They say Jackson Pollock used to eat here for inspiration.
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,Of course I'll sign. What's the hurry?
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,Everything's up in the air.
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,"You know, the hydrogenated fat in that muffin will take years off of your life."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"If they ran out of liver wurst again, just kill me now."
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,She seemed happy with the terms of the divorce.
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,It looks like they took your complaint seriously.
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,If it's the last thing I say...
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Bob, at the risk of sounding like a new feminist, I think you should lean in."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,So I take an extra five minutes for lunch. What's the worst that can happen?
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,This day couldn't get any worse.
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,I've led a charmed life.
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,"So, let's talk life insurance."
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,"Would you mind grabbing the check? I""ll get it next time."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"So, I'm worried about my cholesterol..."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,I've blocked out all next week for a little downtime.
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,I don't know. You think I'm lucky?
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Since I met Joanne, my luck has changed completely"
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,Do we usually tip here?
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,Enough already with your conspiracy theories about the Masons!
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,"So, John Lennon was right about Instant Karma..."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Don't worry, I will take it to the grave."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,I'm going to splurge and order a Danish; it won't kill me!
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,I can't imagine what else could go wrong today!
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Sure, the market's in turmoil, but it's not like the sky is falling."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"I finally got a good nights sleep. "" I feel great""."
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,"...and once my firm reworks their labor deal, the contractor's union will never know what hit them."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Lemme tell ya, Al, this latte is to die for."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,Do you think we should worry about Zika virus?
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Well, live for the moment, I always say."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,Because this 20% tipping thing has run amok. Why do you ask?
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,Probably best to keep the cover on your coffee.
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Whatever you do, don't criticize his son."
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,"Styrofoam, shmyrafoam. I'm so sick of your ""Save the Planet"" soapbox, Fred. I'll drink my coffee anyway I like. Besides, who's going to stop me?"
414,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,516,Ever get the feeling some days that you're a brick shy of a load?
414,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,516,You optimists are always looking up!
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I think I will take that life insurance policy.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"Good news, my cholesterol is..."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Why in such a hurry for me to sign the bill?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,A month off would be gift from heaven.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Did I tell you I had my anti-Trump letter published in the Times this morning?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"I don't know what it is, man. I think I might be getting depressed."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Could you explain the ""act of God"" clause again?"
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,My doctor recommends I cut back on the gluten.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,So I tell them to calm down; The sky is not falling.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,It suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I've got a feeling something is in the air ...
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"I forgot my wallet, would you mind..?"
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"No more drinks for me, I feel a headache coming on."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"So I said, ""Like I'm supposed to walk all the way around the ladder?"""
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,My psychic told me I'm going to have a lot on my mind today.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I feel things are finally starting to go my way.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,The hardest part is not knowing whether I'm going to outlive my money.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Is there anything worse than writer's block?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Sometimes I feel like such a block head.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"With the divorce final, I think we can now be friends."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,i need something stronger than coffee to get me going today
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I feel like the answer to all my problems will hit me any second.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I just need a lucky break.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,But next round on me
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,And then it hit me...
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,Could this day get any worse?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,You seem distracted
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I can't believe how lucky I am to have pulled off this deal.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I am going to stop living in the future.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,All of a sudden it hit me!
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Oh well I guess there';s worse things then being laid off
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"If God exists, I need some concrete evidence."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"I don't like to be a doomsayer, but...."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Didn't you tell her to use Dropbox?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I got rid of the motorcycle. Too dangerous.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,I've been thinking about my future.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Did you hear the fat lady sing?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"I'm telling you, my life can't get any worse."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Do you think I tipped enough?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Don't look now, but there's a guy behind you who looks exactly like the Grim Reaper."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,You know it's great to be an insurance agent. I'm covered for anything.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I just don't feel a thing until I have my first cup of coffee
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"No, it's been a miserable week. But at least it can't get any worse."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,If I could only have a sign...
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,I've decided my best days are ahead of me.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I don't tip
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"Of course I have a will, why do you ask?"
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,I fired the contractor.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Is there something you're not telling me?
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,This will wake me up.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,At least I still have my health.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"So, tell me something I don't know."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Actuarially speaking, I've got another good 40 years ahead of me."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,There's nothing worse than a cold cup of coffee.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,And the bad news?
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,I feel like things are finally looking up.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I can't imagine anything worse than Trump.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,This is my final offer.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"Don't worry, they won't come after you unless something happens to me."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Something, anything, to break the routine."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Sometimes I just need a wake-up call.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"So I asked myself, what could be worse?"
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Heads? What do you mean ""heads""?"
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Finally, I feel like nothing is just hanging over me anymore."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Nothing is ever your fault. Isn't that right, Spencer?"
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,So should I go with the whole or the term?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I don't know - I just have that feeling the other shoe is going to drop soon.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I saw this fortune teller yesterday and she said I should drink less coffee.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,So I made an anti-cementic remark. Big deal.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"You gotta live in the moment, Stu."
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,How does that Damocles story end?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Should I cash in my 401(k) or not? I need some kind of sign.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,Not falling for your lame April Fool this year buddy!
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Unfortunately I had to let my insurance lapse.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"I regret calling him a blockhead, but he doesn't seem to harbor any ill feeling."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,So...what's up?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,You know those divorce papers you think your wife is trying to serve you with . . .
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Who's the Chicken Little now?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"How's my day? So far, so good..."
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,They have a table time limit. But I've never seen it enforced.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,"It looks good on paper Bob, but I'm going to have to sleep on it."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I'm not sure we understand the gravity of the situation.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Lately I've been thinking a lot about mortality.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,My doctor said I have six months to live.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,The waiter says he can cure my hiccups.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,I'm certain my wife has no idea I'm cheating on her.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,My migraine's gone!
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,There may be some lingering resentment....
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,What could go wrong?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Why yes, this table was reserved under ""Wile E. Coyote"". Why do you ask?"
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I find comfort in this rut
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I make my own luck.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,I'll let you know when I have some concrete information for you.
473,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,516,Should we look at the dessert menu?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"If I am lying, may God strike me dead."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"I'll pick up the tab today, Bill."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Did you forget to tip the barista?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Then again, it's not the end of the world."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"And as if things couldn't get worse, I can't get the lid off this coffee."
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Do you have anything for a headache?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,You will never believe where I hid the money.
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,Decaf! Can this day get any worse?
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,"Who calls someone ""blockhead"" these days?"
473,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,516,What's supposed to happen once you've done everything on your Bucket List?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Cinder what ?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,now here's something that's going to hit you like a brick
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"What a week! Scratched the car, couldn't sleep . . ."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Just don't say 'heads up'. I hate that expression.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I need concrete proof.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you have any concrete suggestions?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm blocking on the name, but it'll come to me."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, Wilson, as long as I'm senior partner, your fat bonus is guaranteed."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Why would you ask if I have life insurance?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm finally happy, you know?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Two words, Phil, ""whole-life""."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I just got fired. What worse could happen?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Separate checks, please."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Things are looking up for me too.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"There is nothing that you, or anybody else could say, that could stop me from voting for Donald Trump!"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Sometimes I have to wait for the idea to hit me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Like you always say, ""Today's the first day of the rest of my life."""
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I believe you make your own luck in this world
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,You're always so Chicken Little
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm just trying not to take everything so personally.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,This is perfect....I can finally have his position as CEO.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I just wish something new and exciting would happen to me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,So I used yesterday's cup to get a refill -- what are they going to do?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,If you get this lunch I'll get the next.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Oh don't be dramatic, Herb, it's not like the sky is falling."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So the cement union's not happy, how's that going to affect me personally?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I hate it when I don't have your full attention.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I think my ex is finally letting go of her anger.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,This second cup may make me late but it'll sure hit the spot!
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I've been meaning to make a will. Why do you ask?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Is it just me, or does it feel like everything is falling apart."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'm thinking about buying long term care insurance. What do you think?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll bring in my own drink if I want to and they can't do anything about it.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"... and if it's not true, may God strike me dead."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"This plan covers Murphy’s Law, right?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know, I really love life."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm just trying to work through this Chicken Little syndrome.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Well at least it can't get any worse.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm happy with my job... I've been promoted senior risk analyst.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Relax. Things will fall into place for you very soon.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,You're not listening to me!
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Let’s skip any more talk about insurance and just enjoy the meal.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I just never seem to catch a break. So how's the chicken, Little?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Actually, I'm one of the luckiest guys I know."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"The divorce is going fine, just happy to have a healthy mind and body."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'm gonna need something concrete.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,You no longer need to worry about the market crashing.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Then the idea hit me like a ton of bricks
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife complains that I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I lost everything! What else could go wrong?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I hate to brag, but my people tell me it's going to take a miracle to stop me now."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I think I have a crushing thought.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I don't know what's come over me. I'm such a blockhead!
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Got any aspirin? I feel a crushing headache coming on.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I don't think you're paranoid."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Weren't you supposed to get a ""side"" with the Chicken Little Special?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,It'll hit me in a second.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Sorry, can't do that. My afternoons are all blocked out."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Inspiration's about to strike—I can feel it.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I just don't know Paul... I mean, who am I to judge the gravity of the situation?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'm trying to think of a concrete example.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,How about hitting me with something a little more concrete?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I need an answer now.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I really liked the last episode of 'The Sopranos'.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Guess I'll get the bill.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,There is no way my day could get any worse.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm finally feeling optimistic again about life.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't think of anything that could stop Trump.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I never leave more than ten percent.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Does this taste like Diet to you?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Did I mention I got Hamilton tickets for next week?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"And so I told her that I'd never had one of those ""change your life moments."""
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,So I told her to give me one concrete reason why I should.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'm too old to benefit from infrastructure improvements.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Give me something concrete !
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,The tragedy for me is the soul crushing predictability of my life.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm so bored, I just wish something would happen."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,It's not written in concrete.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I wonder if the Chicken Little comes with a side.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Instead of coffee I could have had a V-8.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Sure things have been tough; But I have the feeling my luck is about to change.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,... and then she had the termerity to accuse me of being a blockhead !
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Don't tell me - another cinder block?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,You won how much?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,The Big Bang Theory is over my head.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I still say the future is in concrete.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I told my ex I'll take her back if she drops some weight.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So tell me again, what happens at these Freemason meetings?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I should've ordered the duck.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I just wish something could jog my memory....
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Enough about my problems. How are you?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I think I've finally hit rock bottom.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I keep wondering, why me?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,So I didn't make partner this time around. But I believe everything happens for a reason.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,So I asked god to give me a message!
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Do you ever get that feeling like there's a cinder block about to fall on your head?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I just have this gut feeling I'm about to be down sized
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"No, I've got all day."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"So I said, “Of course I’ll take it as an annuity. “"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Uh, Fred, I think they want the table."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,There's just no future in brick and mortar stores!
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I can do it, I told my PA to block out my afternoon."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't believe you see the gravity of the situation.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,You won't live long eating like that.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I get it. I don't have to be hit with a sledgehammer.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"First Brenda leaves me, and now the layoff...don't tell me what's next."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,It looks like I've got the check.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Nothing's going to stop me. I am switching to decaf.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm sure glad we worked-out those problems with the unions.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, at least I've still got my health."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,It's just been one headache after another.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Should I be concerned about my future at the firm?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I know I'm babbling...but really, I'm almost done."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I really like the ambiance here.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,You better give me the short version.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Cheryl and I, we've got it all figured out."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yeah, I woke up feeling like today's my lucky day!"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I wish I could stop seeing her
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"No, he won't."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Is there anything worse than when they don't get your coffee right?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Tell me, how could things possibly get any worse?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,So I recently decided to stop making my alimony payments.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I’ve started a bucket list.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Lately I've suspected that Watson is out to get my job.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"When she gets me in her sights, I'll know."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife says I worry too much.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Wonder why they call this the deus ex machina cafe?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I wanted my burger bloody.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'm so glad they kept this place open during remodeling.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Can you keep a secret?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,".. She says she won't. He says he will. But what we really need, is a sign from above"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So, I told her to drop it."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Our divorce ended amicably.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My Cinder date should be dropping by soon...
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Some days are worse than others.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Does Obamacare cover catastrophic injury?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'm just waiting for something concrete to hit me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Haven't you always thought anvils were more of a wedding thing?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,'I think I'm getting writer's block'.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I stole the church collection cup to pay for our lunch.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"You know Stan, sometimes I feel the weight of the world is going to come crashing down on me."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Wishes do come true.......
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,They never leave enough room for cream.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,It used to be He just used lightning.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,You getting the chicken little salad sandwich too?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"All I know is, I'm overdue for a random act of kindness."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll need some proof that the building is structurally unsound.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"And if that's not the truth, may God ..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Seriously though, how can this divorce get any worse..."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,This job is literally killing me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I usually know when the next big thing hits.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"My analyst tells me that I need to change my ""Chicken Little"" view of the world."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Gulliver likes to sweeten my coffee
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'd like to cement this deal right now.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Look, I believe that you make your own luck--"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,So my last boyfriend designed this place.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Can you get the check?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I really feel like things are starting to look up...
578,0,1,1,2,1.5,0.7071067811865476,516,You really think the deal will be blocked?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My life is so damn predictable.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I've gotten rid of a millstone around my neck.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,It's amazing how quickly they built this place.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Remember when you said things couldn't get any worse?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm voting for Hillary.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,At least the sky isn't falling
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Your problem is you're a pessimist.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Do you think I should grow a moustache ?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I want to make a bucket list.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"There's nothing I fear more than a Trump presidency, nothing!"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Maybe I shouldn't of yelled at those workers to be quiet.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I’m not superstitious, but I had a bad feeling about today."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Oh, Ignatz!"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I ordered a karma latte.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Unfortunately, all you have is circumstantial evidence. If something concrete appears, let me know."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Of course, if you think you don't need life insurance..."""
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Ah, coffee. This will be just the jolt I need."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Any last words?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I'm pretty sure they don't serve duck here."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,You may not need the jolt from your coffee.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Things are finally starting to look up.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you believe everything happens for a reason?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Sometimes it pays to be hard headed.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,There can't be anything worse than writer's block
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Wish I could come up with a good excuse to get out of the dinner party my wife is throwing tonight.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think the chef took it personally?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I'd say 'lucky in love,' why do you ask?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Ready for a shock? I have the winning lottery ticket in my pocket.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Well, I've escaped the fallout so far."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"If it's not one thing, it's another."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So yesterday I was thinking - ""Why not? We'll meet. We'll eat. We'll drink ..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"No, by all means. Keep talking about 'Infinite Jest'."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,No one ever tells me anything.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,And my codicil shall read as follows...
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,All those burgers you eat will kill you.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm not worried about me but Peggy is going to be crushed.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I finally feel like a great weight's been lifted off my head.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My OCD is much better thanks. Why just today I started stepping on cracks.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I ordered the brick cheese on wheat toast. Why?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Honest, Jim, the idea is so obvious, it's like being hit on the head by a falling box...."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Tuesday at the Hard Block Cafe
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Only three days until my retirement portfolio matures.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Remember when you said yesterday was the worst day ever?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I still can't believe I hit the lottery for 5 million yesterday.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Insurance? Nah, I'm so young what can happen to me?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I can't change the past, the future is uncertain, all I have is this moment."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Know any good hangover cures?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Don't worry. It's been like that all day.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,What I wouldn't give to escape this rat race.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I hate metaphors
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Normally, I wouldn't be caught dead eating at one of these diners."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"No, I don't give much thought to ""what ifs?"""
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I hate when they give me an extra lump
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Can you give me something more concrete?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Living in the moment is key.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"If you've got something to say, say it."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,What reminds you of the Republican Presidential debates?...
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Our verbal agreement is still valid.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Jim, do you really want to talk about life insurance? Boring!"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Now I believe in karma.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,This headache couldn't get any worse.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I think all this handwringing about infrastructure is overblown.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Free refills? Must be my lucky day!
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My headache is finally gone!
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"There, that's a big weight off my shoulders."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, there's always tomorrow."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My coffee's cold and they overcharged me for the bagel. What else could go wrong today?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Things sure are looking up for a Monday.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I just joined the Optimist Club.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, you go first."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Frank give me something more concrete or the account walks.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm supposed to be off caffeine, but one cup won't kill me."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Baristas are always so judgmental.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Don't take this the wrong way, Gerald."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"At least today couldn't get any worse, right?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Shall I ask for the check?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,My doctor said I suffer from chicken little syndrome...
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, the restraining order didn't specifically prohibit contact by drone..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,So much for living right.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So, he called you a blockhead. Things could be worse."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I can't stress this enough, Johnson--you've really got to learn to put mind over matter."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I've run the numbers. The high-deductible heath plan makes way more sense.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Even our therapist laughed when my wife told her I felt lucky.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Do you ever feel like you can sense a headache before it happens?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I guess I will pay for lunch
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"You know that feeling, like you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I think the worse is probably over.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I am testifying on building code violations.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I can be as hard headed as the next man.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Wait. Let's me get this.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yup, she doubled the policy."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm giving you an exclusive. Jimmy Hoffa's body is buried...
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Sorry I took your spot.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,And then suddenly it struck me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My philosophy has always been to expect the unexpected
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"32 feet per second, per second..."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Don't worry, there's no such thing as karma."
578,0,1,1,2,1.5,0.7071067811865476,516,I'll buy lunch today.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Seriously – at this place – you leave a tip?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I can never think of anything to put on my Instagram page. Can you?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I feel a writer's block coming over me.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"but, then, what else could go wrong"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I comfort myself with the fact that I know things can't get any worse.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,So the divorce isn't going well?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Why the sudden interest in 'low-probability high-impact events'?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I only drink strong coffee when I sense a headache coming on.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Never did like you.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Like I said, the more concrete the better."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I get the worst headaches since I switched to decaf.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I think I'll have the tuna melt instead.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,You gotta be careful with these lids otherwise all the coffee falls on you.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,You shouldn't speak with your mouth full ... what is 'looogowwtmmooov'?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think God will punish me for not leaving a tip?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,My wife thinks I need to pay more attention to her.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I don't think they liked your Yelp review.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'd leave that lid on.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,There’s no harm in being 5 minutes late.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Can you give me something that is more concrete?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,What did Lucy always call Charlie Brown? It'll come to me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Personally, I think the phrase ""hit you like a ton of bricks"" is too cliche"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,We need a more concrete plan.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I can't think of anything, I just need something to hit me."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I suppose I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Have those responses on my desk by the end of the day. I want the calendar cleared before my vacation. While I'm gone, you'll be researching cases for next month. You'll probably have to work both weekends to get it all done."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Got good news from the Doctor this morning
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,They did a nice renovation on this place.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yes, I'm still writing that exposé on the Masons. Why do you ask?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My day just can't get any worse.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I finally feel like my luck is about to change ...
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,You hear about Bill? Poor guy. Never knew what hit him.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I consider myself master of my own fate. Why do you ask?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"They're serious about that ""no elbows on the table"" rule."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Is there something you aren't telling me?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I'm drawing a blank, but maybe something will strike me soon."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Here is where I hid the money
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,The desserts are good except the sponge cake is a bit heavy.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,The odds of Trump becoming president are about the same as. . .
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So Clinton, Trump and Cruz walk into a bar..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I don't think this day could get much worse. Do you?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I wish I could get over this writer's block.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,This first brick will be the foundation of our strong relationship.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Looks like it's time to go.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm sure it was just a hollow threat.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I don't believe in karma. Why?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you ever feel like...I dunno...something big's about to go down?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I miss the brick and mortar days.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Uh, did you order lunch to go?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,All this hype about concussions is way overblown.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Well, it's not the SWORD of Damocles...."""
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"State Farm, why?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"""She's seeing a guy named..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I didn't order duck.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Sometimes I feel like too much weight falls on my shoulders.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Why don't you sign now so we can relax over dessert?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I know Edith would want me to remarry and be happy.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,It's right above me isn't it
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Dating apps? I'm on Cinder.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,...and that's the last time I'm going to say that.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,This is why I always tip.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I'm not just saying this because I'm your life insurance agent, but..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Beep"" ""Beep"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,And then it hit me - I'm not living life fully.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,So what are your plans for the rest of the afternoon?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm not seeing any signs of a crash.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I haven't told anyone, but I'm giving you the promotion..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,All I want is concrete evidence that God exists.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Don't you just hate those new construction regulations?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Do you believe in Karma?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"And then I said ""who needs building codes?"""
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Hell. Who knows how much time any of us have.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Finally, everything seems to be falling into place."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,This should help me wake up.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,C'mon finish your coffee---I don't have much time.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I need another cup of coffee like I need a hole in the head.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Do you think I worry too much?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So I get fired, and then my wife leaves me. Could this day get any worse?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"My turn buy, right?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I really feel that the contractor appreciated my recommendations.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I swear, there's nothing worse than a lid that doesn't quite fit."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I feel like my life has become too predictable lately.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,On second thought I might need a tax extension this year
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Uh… I wouldn't worry about the extra calories.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Go ahead and cancel your 3 o'clock Jim.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm about to lose my mind.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Maybe it's me but lately I just feel like a target.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Y’know, my ex lives in the walk-up above this place."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Let me be more concrete.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My Ex keeps threatening to block me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I just wish this dark cloud would lift.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,We should have left a tip last time.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't know. Maybe something new will hit me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I just wish I could forget this whole day.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Are you even listening to me at all?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know Bob, I finally feel like things are looking up for me."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,".....but my friends call me ""Lucky"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't believe in writer's block.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Why am I so depressed?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm just so glad I finally have a handle on those migraines.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,There are days I think I shudda stayed in bed.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I knew we should have tipped better last time!
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Do you ever feel like your world is just falling apart?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,You know that stuff will kill ya.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Wait! I'm about to make my point concrete.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I understand the gravity of the situation.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Blockhead yourself, numbskull."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,No way in hell am I going to vote for Donald Trump
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Good thing we settled with the union.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I have planned for every eventuality.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I've decided to vote for Trump.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I think my ex-wife is out to get me.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I need a change.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Nothing hurts more than stepping barefoot on a kid's Lego brick.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Those doughnuts will kill you.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I don’t believe in luck.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Are you even listening to what I'm saying?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I need something concrete.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Any plans for tonight?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"""So yea, atheism has worked for me-why do you ask?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Chicken Little. Another useless cliché.
578,0,1,1,2,1.5,0.7071067811865476,516,"I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes I feel like a cinder block is about to fall on my head."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Oh, and I signed up for that new drone delivery service everyone's' talking about."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Things have been going well, can't complain. How about you?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I'd say we've got a 100% chance of success."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Please don't tell me it's that cinder block again.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,And does it cover imminently existing conditions?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm telling you Charlie, the advertising business is brutal. This latest case of writer's block is killing me."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Great pitch for a movie, but I need to see stars."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"The offer's fine, but Acme takes its noncompetes pretty seriously."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"My doctor said I could postpone the colonoscopy, but better safe than sorry, right?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Pondering the gravity of the situation
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Remember when I told you we should invest in infrastructure?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"So, I asked my students: ""Would a brick or a feather fall faster on the moon?"""
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know, Dave, people would like you more if you weren't such a Chicken Little."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Why should I be forced to buy health insurance?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Catch a falling brick, and put it in your briefcase. Save it for a rainy day."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Wow, he was right... Today really is his last day at work."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,And then the scene ended. Just like that.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I wish the universe would send me a sign.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Real quick, Steve – what’s your garage code?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My doctor told me I'd live to be 100.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I haven't had a good idea since the stone age.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Dad!"" WHAT?, Nothing, "" I'm rich."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I asked for crushed ice in my drink.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"As I was saying, the bottom 's gonna drop outta this."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm surprised we finally closed the deal. My horoscope said I was going to encounter a huge stumbling block today.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think the waiter was giving me attitude when I asked to substitute the ethically-sourced kale?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,At this point nothing would surprise me.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I am just so tired of people interrupting me.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Did I mention my firm completed retrofitting the place in record time?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,So nothing from her lawyer?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,May a cement block fall on my head if the Republicans are stupid enough to nominate either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz for President.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,No way Donald Trump's ever going to know I didn't vote for him.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Please don't splatter.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My one regret in college. I never got stoned.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Ugh, writer's block."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My luck's gonna change. I can almost feel it.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,The coffee here comes with a kick.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"In the absence of further problems, let's go ahead with it."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I must have told them 100 times it tastes like concrete!
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Why do they say April is the cruelest month?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I’m not sure you comprehend the gravity of this situation.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I never listen to people who say the sky is falling.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"See, I told you it would be good to get out and go to a real brick and mortar establishment...."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Honest George, I can't shake this feeling of impending doom."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My cholesterol has improved.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I just wish I could block it out of my mind.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Why the Chicken-Lttle expression?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't think this week could get any worse.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"I've got nothing concrete, but it will come to me."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"They call this drink ""The Block Buster""!"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,And this latte was half price. Must be my lucky day.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Did you say Trump is dropping by?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Don't worry, it isn't a piano this time."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I feel like things are finally beginning to fall my way.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"And this idea hit me, like a ton of bricks."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I'm looking for something more concrete.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,and all of the sudden it hit me....
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Yeah, I’m an organ donor. Why?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"There's no way I""ll budge."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Tell me truthfully...isn't that the most bizarre thing you've ever heard in your life?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Not many people have crane smash their car on West Broadway and live to tell the tale, eh?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"and after all that, it seems like maybe, just maybe, I've finally caught a break..."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I keep telling her I'm overinsured.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Any strong feelings about destiny Ralph?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"All in all, I'd say things are looking up!"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I fear this new low cost, one-at-a-time terrorism."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"...I mean, I'd rather DIE than vote for Trump"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I signed up on this new reminder app.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Would you please look at me when I'm talking to you?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yeah, well this is only block Monday... you don't wanna be around for grand piano Friday"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"This time it's on me, kid."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,We should be hearing from the high court on our appeal soon.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Should I or should I not tell him? I mean, he was never really nice to me in the first place."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm not sure if my ex-wife is happy with her settlement.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Quick, smell the coffee!"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,What were you saying about the drop dead date?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,What earthquake?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, as soon as we get back to the office, I'm firing you."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I finally paid off my student loans. Things are really looking up!
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know, sometimes I wonder whether Isaac Newton was actually a genius or just in the right place at the right time."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,It'll hit me in a moment.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Seriously, I am a very lucky man!"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"No, I don't get headaches. Why do you ask?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"You're right, you never know."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Sorry! I cannot renew your policy.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"People complain about bad luck, but it's really about their bad choices."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Go Trrrrrrrrrrrrump!!!
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Everyone calls me a blockhead at work.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I can just feel it, my writer's block is about to end."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,It's on me -- I insist.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,What's your ATM pin?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,You'll never guess how much I squeezed out of the contractors on this building.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,You mean concrete block; cement is just an ingredient.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Man, this coffee sure hits you like a ton of bricks."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't shake this feeling that the other shoe is about to drop.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,36 years and I'm finally retiring.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Did you see a sign that said, ""Shirts, shoes, and hardhats required?"""
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,Can't wait for this day to be over.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,This time it's your check...mate.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"There I was,tryin to remember,When it hit me like a ton of bricks."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"I just need something concrete, ya know?"
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,It could be worse...
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,It's tea. Coffee gives me a headache.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Life's too short to drink bad coffee, don't you think?"
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,The latte here is to die for.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Be honest with me. Do I come across as hard headed?
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I guess there're worse things than writers block.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Last mortgage payment,last alimony payment, yep Jim, things are finally looking up."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, we're just one block away from the hospital."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"The psychic told me that a Cindy, a Sandra, or a Sandy would appear in my future, but I'm not convinced."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,My only complaint with this restaurant is that sometimes the food is a little heavy.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Eat up, Bill. Time is money."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"Karma? Yes, I believe in karma."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't believe in curses--the Cubs are going all the way this season.
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Funny. Last week it was a piano.
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,"Did you ever work in a restaurant and spit in someone's food? No, why? Times have changed..."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,Could you at least look at me when I'm talking to you?
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"This one's on you, Pete."
578,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,516,"The sky is falling? Geez, next thing you'll say my cup is half empty."
578,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,516,I wonder why they call it the 'chicken little' soup...

1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,"On the bright side, I have my health."
1130,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,516,She said that nothing would get through my thick skull. I hope that she's right.
1130,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,516,I really told them off when I resigned from Acme this morning!
1130,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,516,Nothing annoys me more than when they bring the bill before you're finished.
1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,I think things should be looking up!

1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,It all feels so heavy.
1130,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,516,"As I stated earlier, you'll have the Vice President position over my dead body."
1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,One more wouldn't hurt

1130,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,516,"So apparently, it all comes down to this thing called karma."
1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,Let me just think about it overnight.
1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,I can't fathom how my life could get worse.
1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,...and then the medium said that today I would be struck dead by a cinder block and so I avoided the construction by my office building entirely.
1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,The coffee here always gives me a headache.
1130,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,516,"Boy, I could really use something to clear out my head."
1130,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,516,Relax. The law of gravity doesn't apply to cartoons.

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I feel like my life is just slipping away
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"'Ahhhh....you know what Bob, I'll get the check next time'"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Labeling her a stalker would be an understatement.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,... And then one day you won't even know what hit you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Now lets get down to business. Where do I sign for that new life insurance policy you've been touting?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You forgot to knock on wood.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Those people just bring down the block.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm sure an idea will come to me soon.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The moment when Larry's fantasy became reality.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't think I have a future...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think I should have tipped the barista?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Are you going to eat that?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Funny thing, Andy, I had the strangest horoscope in this morning's paper."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I guess I'm just a natural born optimist.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Some people just aren’t self-aware.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You know that feeling...?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Nope, I don't see duck on the menu."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm having a no good, very bad day!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think the union is starting to come around.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Damn, it was supposed to be a piano."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't believe in Karma...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,should I drink this coffee or not ?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And then my therapist says, ""You're right. You are the unluckiest person I've met""."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I have these migraines and
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It just hit me - it's either her or me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Life is so unpredictable, isn't it?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Good food. Bad service.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Some days, I just feel like the sky is falling"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"The market's bad, but I wouldn't say the sky is falling."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I hope you asked for one lump, not two."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And if that wasn't enough, out of the clear blue sky she calls me a blockhead."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My contractor seemed less than receptive about my constructive suggestions.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,She keeps telling me I need be more spontaneous.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm repeating myself for the last time, understand pal?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Can you pass the salt?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm always wondering when the other shoe is going to fall...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You seem preoccupied.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't understand you when you have food in your mouth.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just wish more things in my life were concrete.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Are you using ""brick"" figuratively?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I have a funny feeling about today.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm sorry. My wife can believe in horoscopes if she wants to. I'm not superstitious.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"On second thought, no deal. Go ahead and sue me."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just feel this great weight coming down on me
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just don't see the need for that long term care coverage.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Nothing has helped me get over this writer's block.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I literally have only a second.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Hey, are you gonna eat that?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll sign my will after our drinks.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And if my plan crosses some moral line, let God throw a brick."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You can't go wrong with whole life insurance.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Hurry up and sign the life insurance application Charles.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,GUESS WHAT!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"What the heck, Larry, let's live a little."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you believe in devine intervention?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Let me explain why your contract with the mob is non-binding.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I forgot to get my usual lump of sugar. Anyway, as I was saying, God sucks..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Ever feel like nothing exciting happens to you anymore?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Someone ought to do something about this coffee
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I had the best dream last night…all my friends and family were celebrating at once.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Are you going to finish that ?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My physician said the muffins are hazardous to my health.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,That's All Folks.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I don't have anything scheduled this afternoon...why do you ask?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Trust me on this one...it's a win-win situation.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Life is short. Say yes.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,That's why I drink coffee here...safest part of town.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Darn it, they gave me a cappuccino and I asked for a flat white."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Are you paying with cash?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So ...what are the chances of my ex-wife retaliating?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I was thinking of downloading the horoscope app on my watch...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Only divine intervention could screw up this deal.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I always feel like there's a weight on my shoulders
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Helen texted I should expect her answer anytime now.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll be glad when I don't have to listen to that construction anymore.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm a white American male at the peak of my career in the 21st century. Really, I have no worries."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So I said to him, ""bad things happen to bad people"""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"""Well, whaddya know. Dreams do come true""."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Today's my lucky day, I just feel it."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Sometimes life throws you a curve ball, and you have to deal with it."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you remember to tip?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I know...but I'm pretty sure if I ignore it, it'll just disappear."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"My insurance company? New England Life, of course!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"This is a write off, right?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know, I've had this ominous feeling all day."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Anything to get out of work today.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So I told them 'Who needs your silly witness protection program?'
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Oh, and ACME moved in upstairs."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I don't want a refill. Why?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,No news is good news.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife always says I'm hard-headed.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,She said her dad was in construction.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife's lawyer is from Acme Suddenly Single.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"That's the thing about this election season, the lack of gravity."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Should I unfriend Milton or block him? #heavy
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I've never been hit with writer's block."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Some days you wake up and say to yourself, 'I just don't see how this could get any worse.'"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I have to stop thinking these dark thoughts
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Tom, you should really take back what you just said."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Why, after all this time, are you still holding it over my head?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Eating those fast food burgers will kill you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Do you have an aspirin, I feel a splitting headache coming on."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What's my risk outlook?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I wouldn't complain about the service again
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You just have to block out negative thoughts.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And so my editor said, ""Getting through writer's block's a breeze . . . something will hit you."""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Sure am glad the building inspector gave the okay.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So I told him that I have done some thinking and I don't need a life insurance...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"...so she asked me, ""One lump or two?"""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Things are looking up!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My favorite song? Its now or never!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"If you must know, I ordered the 'Flat White'. Why do you ask?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I really don't see why we should raise the minimum wage.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"…barring an act of God, of course."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,They forgot the whipped cream again. Could this day get any worse?!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,If only I could get some kind of sign that things are finally looking up.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This headache can't get any worse.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm sure it's a reasonable offer but I just don't feel a need for life insurance just now.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Don't you ever get tired of the same old same old every day?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Son, I've got your back."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Anything else, my time's about up on the meter?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Me? I'm good.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,and another thing that i don't like.......................
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I wish my hangover would end now!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Where's the Disgruntled Barista Surprise I ordered?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Let me get it this time.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I don't know about you, but I'm heading to the last roundup."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I get it this time.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I have this sudden urge for a Fig Newton.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You know it's nothing concrete or anything but lately I just haven't been able to shake this sense of impending doom
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I hope I didn't spatter you with the coffee. The lid is hard to get off.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I like one lump with my coffee.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"After 32 years at that hell hole, I'm really looking forward to my retirement tomorrow."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I must reveal this horrible secret about your
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This meeting was just to give you a heads up.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I was thinking of ordering the souffle.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I should have gotten a sandwich too. There's nothing worse than going to a meeting hungry.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife and I were talking about the design for our new home. I was just telling her how much I hate masonry; and then it hit me!

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I hear the company's just about to start making cuts.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm telling you, Stuart. The secret to happiness is planning. Long-term, conservative planning."

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Nice to do business in an actual brick and mortar store.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Not getting that promotion hit me like a ton of bricks, but I'm optimistic things are going to change now."

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I wish I had something to look forward to.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's now or never.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,When I get an idea it comes out of the blue.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Bill, can you pay attention when I am talking to you?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I'm pretty sure it's the brick of Damocles."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Sometimes I feel like a character in a roadrunner cartoon.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you read about the killer called the Cinderblock Shot Putter?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I never tip for coffee.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll explain the gravity of the situation to you after this coffee; it's a life saver!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm starting to feel like a blockhead.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I've no idea, but I'll know when it hits me"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,have you heard the one about those annoying life insurance salesmen
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I guess I'm stuck with the bill...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Where'd what come from?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And then she said: ""You can keep your money darling, I am starting my own construction business anyway."" I wonder what she's up to, she hates dust."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Heads or tails..................
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The new building codes are really killing us construction managers.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I really don't think things could get any worse than they already are.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm telling you; brick and mortar business is Dead.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Will you just for once restrain yourself and let me finish my sentence.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Boy, have I had a rough day!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think she will contest the divorce?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know, too much self-awareness is fatal"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you prefer 1 lump or 2?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Sure I'm unfaithful, manipulative and possessive, but like Jesus said: let he who is without sin cast the first..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think I'll take another lump.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Trust me, you won't need the prospectus."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,May the ceiling fall on me if this isn't a great deal!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just can't take repeated warnings that the sky is falling seriously.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Face it, we could both be dead tomorrow...."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm feeling lucky today; the market is up!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I think your luck will change, in the other world."

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Nothing is worse than being served stale coffee.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"When I tell her it's destiny, she says I'm a blockhead."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"If this isn't the best retirement plan for you, may God strike me dead!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,We're developing the air rights.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"The loss of that account hit me like a...well, you can imagine."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,She threatened to block me on Tinder.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've got an interview with a Fortune 500 headhunter.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"If you think life is a headache now, it could be worse."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I agree - the overhead is a definite liability.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Your problem is that you're not optimistic enough. Stop thinking thinking there's danger around the corner.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm telling you, there's no such thing as fate."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I have long term insurance, why?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"George, this may be your last breakfast."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I recommend the duck.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I hear they have a killer Happy Hour.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,still undecided?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My cat bit the dust. My kid totaled my car. What do you suppose is the third strike?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Somebody put me outta my misery already!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Did you just hear a ""beep, beep?"""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Guess what, Herb. Looks like I've done everything on my bucket list."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I wish I had a more concrete idea.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Just give me one example how God could speak to us without circumventing the laws of nature.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Speaking of blockheads...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Relax... I hate pushy insurance salesmen.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Hell no. If I believed in karma, I wouldn't be where I am today."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Just give one single concrete example
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The fortune in diamonds is hidden under the...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I ordered the heavy cream. Why?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,No sugar. How can I get a lump?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And of that is not the truth, may God strike ..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I always get blocked when its time to work on these progress reports.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll tell you the bad news first.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you order that burger bloody?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I see big things coming your way...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Then she said, ""Would it kill you to go out and enjoy yourself for once?"""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"....and that's the gist of it. Oh, and to top it off...."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife claims that she put a hex on me. Rubbish!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't believe that tomorrow is finally my retirement day.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The cartoonist must be desperate if we're going classic now.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yes, but where's the concrete proof that He exists?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't know... it's nothing concrete.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"If my wife knew, she'd kill me."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So I told her ‘Screw you and your Gypsy curse.’
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So that's your final word on the subject?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,How do they get away with calling this place Starblocks?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I feel writer's block coming on.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't think the calories are your biggest problem
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My dream was always to build something with you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,BAM and then it hits you
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And then she said, ""you'll never see it coming . . ."""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The answer literally hit me like a ton of bricks!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I need a reason stronger than Trump to abandon the Republican party.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife is still experimentong with new methods of getting my attention.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,If I don't have my morning coffee I get a splitting headache.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You have no idea how happy I am that we traded seats.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I am not worried about the crumbling infrastructure."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just know my luck has got to change.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yes, my wife is still allergic to flowers. Why?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've finally dismissed irrational fear from my life.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I called him a blockhead for believing in karma.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,That's the last time I'm ordering a kale salad.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,He said “karma” like I should know what it means.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Then I told Mr. Trump exactly what I thought of him...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yes, I do expect the unexpected."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm struggling to overcome an irrational fear of impending doom.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just always feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So I told him again that I had enough insurance and insisted that he leave.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I worry too much about my cholesterol.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So when do I get my 15 minutes of fame?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I guess an anvil would be passé.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I violated my non-disclosure agreement.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The study I just read says you can live longer if you drink more coffee.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Sometimes I feel about as interesting as a cinder block.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do we have to decide right this second?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea to stop for coffee.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"For once, I really feel like today is my day."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Better luck next time Joe, they chose me for the position."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, maybe not a ton, but at least one would have to hit me before I vote for that slob."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've had just about enough of this concrete jungle.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,They say their dessert is a real blockbuster.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Insurance is for suckers.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm such a klutz. I'm always spilling my coffee.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Drone delivery of building supplies? Never happen.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm depressed. Management told me this morning that they are offering me a retirement plan that I can't refuse.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I guess I'm a chip off the old block.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think your coffee break's over
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I mean, what else could possibly go wrong?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"This place will sell, just downplay it as a fixer and and emphasize the impact this older architecture makes."

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Hey! I just remembered where Jimmy Hoffa's buried.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What'd you say? I was daydreaming.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I still don't know why you asked me to switch seats.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So on balance this has been a good year so far.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Oh, you know, tomorrow is another day!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Boy, I can't shake this headache."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Any last thoughts?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I never know what to order.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Tomorrow's another day!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"After that meeting, the day can only get better."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't see a downside.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Let me get the check.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So if I buy the insurance policy now, when will it take effect?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Life's short-I'm going to eat dessert first.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I make it a point to anticipate everything that could possibly go wrong.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It just feels like God and me haven't been on the best of terms lately...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Geez, the sky is always falling with you!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm just glad I got my cholesterol under control.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"As an actuary, I know all the risks."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"If we're still not happy, it says someone from the weight staff will be in touch."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,...But I'm sure something will break my way soon.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I said Tinder not Cinder.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"My grandfather was a 33rd degree Mason, but I think it's all Mumbo-Jumbo."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Foresight got me where I am now.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, things are not looking up."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This coffee actually is pretty good. So much for my bad feeling about this place.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's déjà vu all over again.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Heads up, Tom."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think I'm paying too much for life insurance?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I really feel like things are going to start looking up...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Sometimes it seems like the whole world is out to get me . . .
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, the good news is my lab results came back negative..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Here comes another Trump building
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Never mind Frank, its probably too late."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you forget to leave a tip last time we ate here!!!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I was looking for a way to cut down on construction costs and, just like that, it hit me."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,A term policy through work. Why?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Waiter, Separate checks"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"*Should I... or Shouldn't I?"""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"...and not you, or anyone, or any thing is going to stop me..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I believe it's your turn to pay.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just don't see any reason to look up.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Medical Insurance? Disability Insurance? Life Insurance? Who are they kidding?!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yeah, I'm starting to save for retirement this year. You?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've got to tell you -- the answer hit me like a ton of bricks!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,DUCK! DUCK! BRICK!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Deadlines are a killer.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't seem to shake this writers block.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you see what I'm talking about
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you order anything with your coffee?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I dunno, it feels like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,yeah... and then it hit me!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Pay attention, Bob, I'm showing you the right way to dunk."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think we've covered it all. Good meeting.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Or may God strike dead.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Why do they call it a flat white?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Karma's a bitch...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Like you said, our new boss can be a real headache."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Its not like all these sugars are gonna kill me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Can I finish my point please?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I got my cholesterol down under 200. Now what can possibly go wrong?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, how has your day been so far?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,One coffee in the morning gets me through anything.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Have you given much thought to life insurance?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think we can save on construction costs by cutting back on hard hats
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Looking ahead ... .
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,God has a plan for everyone.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm not that worried about sugar killing me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I had this mind block, and then it hit me..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My book on fate is nearly finished.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Something big is coming for me, I can almost feel it."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I lost my wife, job, life savings, at least it can't get any worse...."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Frankly, I find the media's continual 'sky is falling' mentality tiresome."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just beat cancer.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"It's got too many calories, but I figure, you can get killed just crossing the street."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you order the 'Chicken Little' pie?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I wouldn't worry about the promotion if I were you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll pick up the next tab.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What will it take that you adhere to our safety standards?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,IT'S ALL ABOUT MANAGING DOWNSIDE RISK.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You say Trump engages in shoddy construction practices - well, I say where's the proof?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Your not going to believe this but I think things are finally falling into place for me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Seriously, those donuts'll kill ys."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Without an eyewitness or a murder weapon we're gonna need something really concrete here.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm so weary of the ethereal, nuanced ways of thinking."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,We're going to hsve to stop eating here. This place is falling apart.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,do you think of your glass as half empty or full?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll start by providing you with some foundation.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Uh, I'd stop worrying about the other shoe."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What do you think Bob meant when he said he'd be dropping a big one on us today?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I can't tell how lucky I feel to have someone like you to talk to."""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've finally earned enough points for a free refill.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,...and then--right out of the blue--it hit me...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just can't seem to shake this feeling of impending doom.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm SO boring. Just once I would like to be newsworthy.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"What a joke, the bottom's going to fall out."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"The good news is, I'm going to pick up the tab. But..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Whatever you do, don't look up."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,He's not that hard headed.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You appear not to be listening!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Speaking of your wife, does she like dinner and a movie?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I know it's stupid, but I constantly feel like something terrible is about to happen to me..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Actually, I wouldn't worry about what she thinks about your appearance."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, your advice would be to sell immediately. Really? You sure?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What's our drop-dead date for the Flanders contract?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife thinks that being a Trump supporter will turn me into a blockhead!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I run a hedge fund. I don't believe in karma.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's funny; every single thing has been going my way lately.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What the...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My financial planner assures me that I'm not really in any danger for the near term.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The witness protection program works really well.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've always been interested in free masonry.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Not now, Bob- I just thought of the best caption ever - I've been waiting for this day my whole life!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just wish I had proof of the gravity of the situation.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Maybe I should try the duck.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've been thinking about building a wall.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So I figure, if my fund manager thinks things are taking a turn for the better, then who am I to argue?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"The meaning of life finally hit me...and if I could, I'd hit back."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I wonder if these coffee lids are BPA-free.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I couldn't make any sense of it, and then it hit me."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, I think you should reconsider your position."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, not a dark cloud, exactly..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Me? I'm long on ""infrastructure""."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I ate way too much but it hasn't hit me yet!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So - We have a verbal contract -Right ?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,There's no way he can get Mexico to pay for it...and building supplies don't just magically fall from the sky.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"…I mean, it's not like a cinderblock is going to fall on me."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you check your horoscope this morning?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think Trump would make a great president.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The diet's going great. I haven't had anything heavy for two weeks.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Schwindler will retire soon and then we can talk about you becoming a partner.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Their drop down menu has a glitch.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Just bought a lucky charms factory. How about you?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,When did you say you're supposed to see Hamilton?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,She said life with me was too uneventful.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Doing my taxes at the last minute is stressful. I heard Block could help clear my head.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This coffee tastes like mortar
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I probably have been a little too Chicken Little lately.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Very little surprises me anymore.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,...and that's why I'm an atheist.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm telling you, I dodged a bullet with THAT trade Stan."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Never thought much of Issac Newton
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And then she said, ""Don't worry about it, I forgive you."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Sara said i should have seen it coming.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'd like a concrete answer.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So this cartoon coyote keeps following me around.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Today's my last day at work.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"He actually called me a ""Blockhead"" at the meeting"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't help feeling that change is in the air.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So Cheryl and I have been checking out retirement communities.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Sorry, what did you just say about the duck."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Yes I am accident prone. Why do you ask?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Nothing could be worse than this headache.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, anyway, I've decided to sue the garage over a scratch I found on my car."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Sometimes an idea hits me like a bolt from the blue."" ""Or...."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think it says ACME.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"What's with the look, John?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I thought it would be a shoe.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, so much for all your long-term financial planning."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"How safe an investment? You'd have a better chance of a concrete block hitting you in a cafe, than lose on this one."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,For years I searched for the meaning of life. Then it hit me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'd like to put you in charge of our crisis management team, effective immediately."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't begin to describe how bad this divorce feels.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I have some bad news. I going to ask the board to terminate your services this afternoon.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you know the man upstairs?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Last night I told Susan I want a divorce. She took it surprisingly well.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Ever feel like you just need to get out from under?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Last night my wife called me a blockhead, wtf?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I think you meant to download Tinder, not Cinder."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You can't deny he builds great buildings.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"She left me. She says I exaggerate, that no one's luck is as bad as I claim. Any ideas on how I can win her over?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Fortunately, I don't have writer's block anymore"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Carpe nanosecond.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, I don't think Jane knows about the divorce yet."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So I told her, I don't believe in curses."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Things are really starting to look up for me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"""Really, what could be worse than Trump?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,For some reason I just have no interest in this presidential race.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm thinking cinder block.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Come on, saying that you have a writer's block is just an excuse to avoid writing."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"""Drop down, ye heavens, from above."" Isaiah 45:8"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Barbara says I need to be more self-aware.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You never know when a good idea might hit you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"This is fine, but you've probably never heard of my favorite coffee shop."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This taste bitter to you?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,No...I'm pretty sure it's called Tinder.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's a prop for a New Yorker cartoon.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did you order the Chicken Little?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"TOMORROW, I'LL BUY"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,". . . so I splurged on the Ferrari, 'cause life's too short."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I would suggest that you move on that caption contest idea post haste
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Coffee's cold. I won't be coming here again.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"If it's not one damn thing, it's another!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm the luckiest man in the world...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Jones, we're going to have to start from the ground up on this one, a block at a time."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm just waiting for the other brick to fall.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Karma?....Really?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Suddenly, it hit me like... ."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,These old industrial spaces are amazing!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"But Hell. Y'know what they say, ' Every dark cloud...'"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You didn't tip either?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,How much did you tip the waiter?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"""Donald, did you read your horoscope today?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"As you know, subtlety is not my strong suit..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've been having these headaches.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What are the odds?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What lump ? Sugar's not good for me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yes, I remember. I asked for one lump."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife wants a divorce. My boss wants me to resign. What else can happen?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you really believe anyone can predict the future?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Here it is, Aquarius: ""A smashing event will change your life""."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'll believe in 'climate change' when something concrete happens.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Food trucks shmood trucks--nothing beats a brick and mortar restaurant.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Just ask God to show you a sign, Bob, and He will."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'd like some concrete answers as soon as possible.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Glad your sister is so understading and invited me here to discuss that affair.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Stocks are dropping, bonds are dropping-"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Lunch is getting pretty boring...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"My therapist says ""Live every moment of life as if it's your last."""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know, I think you have to make sure a restaurant has banned tipping before you decide not to leave one."

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,How would you rate the ambiance?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You know what I like about the street food business? No overhead.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I tell you, I feel like a great weight has just been lifted from my shoulders."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,There is really no good time to tell your best friend you are in love with his wife.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, compared to the convention this should be a breeze"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Great food. Lousy atmosphere.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I believe you make your own luck.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Things couldn't be better, thanks."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm just not feeling good about today.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm telling you, Frank, you're in for a rude awakening with all that gluten and read meat..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I never tip the barista.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Thanks for switching spots with me. The A/C above that seat was killing me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Tut, tut! Looks like pain"

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's been a long day. I wish I had something harder than this juice.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,All science is just theory. Take gravity for instance . . .
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Could you ever see yourself having my job?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So the weatherman actually got one right?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You got yours for here, I got mine to go."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"That's good, but I need something concrete!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"They raised the premium on my life insurance policy, so l canceled it."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Of course they want me to direct the sequel!

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Think I'll knock off early today.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Unlike me, she was always a 'sky is falling' pessimist."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Any regrets
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You just don't understand the gravity Of the situation!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The price of coffee these days... It hits ya like a tonne of bricks.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,We should have eaten at the next block.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The coffee's great but the decor here is too heavily brick-a-bac.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This day cannot get any worse.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"How's it feel to hear I slept with your wife, 'Mr. Alleged Clairvoyant Magician'..."

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What's this item about ceiling repair?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And I said, 'Babe, it's LA, who needs an umbrella?'"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This may sound strange but this is the best day I've had in years
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I feel good. Like there is nothing hanging over my head anymore.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Ugh -- decaf. Now I'm gonna have a headache all day.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I keep waiting for a sign that she hasn't given up on us.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What exactly is a karma chameleon anyway?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You have no idea how good it feels to be out from under suspicion.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So I said to myself, 'What's the worst that can happen?'"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,When was the last time you had a sense of foreboding?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So...when does the insurance policy kick in?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I guess this one's on you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Relax--what could go wrong?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Cream in the coffee is nice, but skim milk is healthier."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm really concerned about a huge crash.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm a big-picture thinker. Why should I focus on more immediate issues?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I feel like the sky is falling
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Some people need to be hit with a ton of bricks before they realize their New Yorker cartoon captions just aren't funny.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't get it. I thought he said the Kenyan blend had a hard finish.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yeah, that was my wife calling. I never take her calls."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Looks like a woman finally broke through that glass ceiling of yours.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Nothing. What are you doing tonight?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm having the pancake.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I need another donut like I need a hole in the head.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Thank God, he hasn't signed it yet."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Harrison, that's what I like about you - so optimistic! Always looking up!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'll tell you man. If I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Can things get any worse today?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm dying of boredom, Bill. Nothing ever happens."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, I know I should consider something more concrete."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I wished for a ton of bricks, but this is fine."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"...and I said, 'George, you're wrong. What do you need; a brick upside the head to see the Truth?'"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Theres absolutely nothing that can go wrong with this plan.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,May God strike me down if I'm wrong.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You will get that job over my dead body,"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I built this place.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"It's 'Dunkin' Donuts', not 'Duck' - why do you ask?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,And then she called me a blockhead.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't really understand the point of the story to this show...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My broker's view of the stock market sounds like Chicken Little. He thinks the sky is falling!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I favor the top-down approach.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's kind of like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop---only worse.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'll tell ya Ned, all this tax stuff is giving me a migraine."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think Damocles was a family name. Why do you ask?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Barring any unforeseen circumstances...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Gary, I feel that now is the appropriate time to tell you that your wife and I have been having an affair."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Duck? No, I'm strictly Vegan."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You really should cut down on the fatty foods.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,May God strike me dead if I'm not telling you the honest truth!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's no secret. I take everyday as it comes.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I feel real lucky today.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm glad I didn't send my wrap back.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You know those days when nothing goes right?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You're overlooking the gravity of the situation.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,How many visits to your next reward?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,For years I struggled with the meaning of life . . . then it hit me like a ton of bricks.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The gods must have noticed your light headed.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"the divorce went well, don't you think ?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I finally told Barbara it's over.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, now I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"It's nothing concrete, just an overwhelming existential fear."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,How about them bricks? I mean Knicks!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you know how the Feds cracked the iPhone?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Usually something hits you like a pile of bricks, but I don't know what a lone cinder block means."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My favorite cartoon? I've always been partial to Krazy Kat.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You won't believe what happened today.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know, I sometimes wonder where I'll be in 20 years."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Well, there'll be concrete evidence that it wasn't me who did it."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,They say the coffee in here has got some kick to it.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I guess I'm not having a bad day after all.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm not going to get those revenue reports in on time, am I, George?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Knock on wood - the divorce has been very amicable so far.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Eat here long enough and it'll kill you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Sometimes it feels like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,How'd you wanna go?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, David, I've decided to put you back in my will."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Did I ever wish I had Spidey sense? Why do you ask?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Your proposal is a little heavy handed
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'd like to say that it can't get any worse, but..."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm sure of one thing--I'll never vote for Trump.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Isn't life just random?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Boy, this writer's block is really killing me."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's a cinderblock isn't it.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This is one of those days when you have to wonder what the hell else can go wrong?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You ask me if Lilly has ever cheated on me? I know for a fact that my wife has always been faithful to me. So Mike why do you ask. ?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You're the last person who should be giving me a 'Heads up.'
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Guess my geolocation app is off by about 3 feet.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,No...nothing going on in my life.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Have you ever had that feeling...?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Surprisingly, I've had worse dates."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Lately, I've been feeling this enormous weight over me."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I probably should have eaten the chef's special instead of sending it back to the kitchen.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Things have really fallen off around here.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And so I said, ""well, where do you think you're going to get a brick?"""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Are you going through a divorce?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,We've been close for years...but they can't keep both of us.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Okay, I'll give you a concrete example."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yeah, but you can get killed crossing the street."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Man. I feel a headache coming on.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm getting to that age when I realize I don't have all the time in the world.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I'm telling you Jim, I am sick of all the headaches!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Should have tipped.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Just a second, it'll come to me"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Brick & mortar just isn't relevant anymore.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I need some excitement in my life.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"They're going to make me department head, just watch."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Bert, I never remember...is it schadenfreude or schatenfreude?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Do you think the April Fools pranks are getting out of hand this year?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,How risky could it be if I continued to deny science?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Do you ever have those days, when the whole world seems to coming down around you."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Before the recession that would've been a piano
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"If you have time tomorrow, I'll talk with Marge tonight and then we can sign that insurance policy. Will that work for you?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, three strings should hold it."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Then she said, 'I believe you'. How lucky is that?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Goodbye Frank.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"At times like these, I wish I wasn't a statistician."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,What'da you think about the new high-rises in the neighborhood?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Er, lean in?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The lunch in this place is knockout
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Is there a problem?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Wha'd ya say? You called me a blockhead?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So I told him, 'At least I'm not a construction worker...'"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So I got that going for me...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So the punk cuts me off...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You should have seen that construction worker's face when I told him to stop oogling my secretary.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Oh God, I was kidding!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I wouldn't wait on the cream and sugar if I were you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Will? Why would I need a will?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think I can offer you some concrete advice.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Stanley, you're not paying attention."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I can't seem to lose this sense of impending doom.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I just remembered the good news that I wanted to tell you.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Full cash offer with no contingencies
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I guess a 25% tip won't kill me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,This is your classic brick and mortar store.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"When you least expect it, an idea will hit you like a brick."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm sensing a disturbance in the force.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My ex has been in a much better mood since she went to see a fortune teller.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,That's when it hit me.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Like I said, I am all for busting the unions"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Think I'll skip dessert.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I finally got rid of my migraines.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Look out, here comes Cindy Block."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife says I've become a doom and gloom Republican. What the hell does she know?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think something big is going to happen soon.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Nice knowing you!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I don't play the odds. I deal with the here and now.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,It's all about location and timing.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'm more of an anti-mason myself.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yes, Obama Care. Why?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,My wife thinks I need to find a purpose in life.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I wonder why the Board of Health only rates this place as a ""C""?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Actually, more of a hoper really than a believer. Why?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Cindy? Who's Cindy?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"and then it hit me, life happens when you least expect it."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"You know that cookie will kill you, don't you ?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,The building market will crash. Be ready.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I agree. In this global market it's not a matter of if, but when."

1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So, when will the new reconstruction contract be signed?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"""Heads"" what?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Say it--Don't spray it.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Yeah,I definitely feel a change of luck is in the air!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Could you get the bill? I'm close to being broke.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Coyote? Where?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Believe me Frank, I've been around the block."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"So I'm just walking down the street, minding my own business, and this bird poops on my head."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I've told you a 100 times...I really HATE Downton Abbey. It's no big deal. OK?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,...and then I told my wife I wasn't being hard-headed about it.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I think everything's finally falling into place.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"I lost my job, my friends and family think I'm a loser, my dog ran away... What have I got to lose?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"New England Life, why do you ask?"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Whoa....did you just call me a BLOCKHEAD!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I finally met Tabitha's parents. Her mom's a teacher and her dad's a mason.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I really think my luck is about to turn around.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Have you ever found yourself in a place where you feel you're just waiting for a sign?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I heard that one of us is getting downsized
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,God strike me dead if I'm lying
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"This is a no-brainer, Hal."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,We separated on amicable terms.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Sometimes it's like ""I should'a stayed in bed..."""
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Que sera, sera."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"My job is great, kids are great, wife is great life is really looking up"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Be careful what you wish for. Killed by idiom!
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Revenge of the glass ceiling
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,So you say you have a contingency for anything unforeseen?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Monday mornings are so boring.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,You have a will?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Life's a crapshoot-I took a flyer on the Phillies at 300 to 1.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Hah! My horoscope says “Avoid coffee today.”
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"''I've had some bad luck, but I refuse to believe I'm unlucky.''"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Guess what? I won the lottery today.
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,I'LL PICK UP THE CHECK NEXT TIME
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,... but - as they say - all's well that ends well...
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,Why don't you ever look at me when we talk?
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"And if Donald Trump isn't the best candidate of the whole pack, may a great cinder block strike me on the head RIGHT NOW!"
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"No, its PENNIES from heaven."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"Oh, come on, Phil! April Fool's Day was last week."
1479,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,516,"...but if somebody else slips on a banana peel, that's funny."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Life's a brick: you get laid and run into a wall.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,And then this clown tried to sell me life insurance.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"You just never know, do you?"
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Why do you keep calling me Damocles?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Did you know this place is closing?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,You wouldn't believe what my horoscope said today.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,What do you think God will say when he hears I'm voting for Trump?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"When I get a great idea, it hits me like a ton of bricks."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Do you think I'm too pessimistic?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Some days I don't feel like getting up.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I just need a sign
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,And that's my final offer
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,That brings us to item number six on your expense report...'cinder block booby-trap'. I'll have to disallow that as well!
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"I am a pessimist by nature, it is true."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Yes Rick, I do know what irony is but I fail to see how that relates to you being a block head."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,So I finally broke up with Bellatrix last night.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Did you ever wake up with the feeling something big was gonna happen?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,My problem has always been I'm too theoretical. I just have no talent for concrete thinking!
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Let me tell you, it's been a hell of a day!"
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Anything weighing on your mind?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Who are you calling a blockhead?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I hear overhead is coming down.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Ever feel like nothing is going your way?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,You worry about tomorrow too much.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,At least now I have a reason to be late to work.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I told him not to send back the soup.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Did you ever wake up feeling like nothing bad could possibly happen today?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Trust me. Life insurance is a sucker's bet.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Then he called me a blockhead.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I feel lucky today
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,What's wrong? You look like you just saw a falling block of concrete.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Yes, my life insurance premiums are paid up. Why?"
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Nah, a light bulb isn't pragmatic. It isn't achievable. At least with a cinder block, you know what you're getting."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,You shouldn't have complained about your tea.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Well at least your rain cloud is gone.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,You're right. There's nothing you can do.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I just won the lottery.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Have you been following the concussion studies from the NFL?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"""Don't even try talking me out of it, I'm getting out of the construction business once and for all""."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Are you going to finish that sandwich or keep staring at that cinder block for the rest of our meal?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Did you see the way that old gypsy looked at me?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,The concept here is brilliant: replace the waitresses with drones.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,It's like we're stuck choosing between a bullet or poison.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"I was trying to remember her name, and then it hit me..."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Can you give me just a moment?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Thanks for blocking some time out with me today.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I don't get irony. It's gotta just hit me over the head.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,You can die if you keep eating that stuff!
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Any new ideas on ways to test the new NFL concussion protocols?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,It's rude to talk with your mouth full.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I just know my luck's gonna change soon.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,This latte better be worth it.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Can't remember. Mental block.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Et tu, Blocke'?"
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,------if I'm not telling the truth.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"I'm warning you, Harry. The sky really is falling this time."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Ever feel like you're sitting under the sword of Damocles?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,My shrink suggested that I fast-track my upstairs renovation and enjoy it longer.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,This wills you all but pen just conked out.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"The ""chicken little special"" isn't sitting well with me."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"So then, suddenly, it hits me!"
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Do you ever wake up feeling lucky? I feel like today's my lucky day.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Ya know, I've felt like nothing has been heading my way today ."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,You never know when inspiration will hit you.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"I don't care what my wife says, spending our life savings on those hair plugs has really paid off."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Is it a deal? Yes or. No
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"O.K., confession time."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,That pastry will kill you.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"If I'm lying, may the Lord strike me down right now."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"I don't know what the answer is either, kid. I'm just waiting for it to finally hit me."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Keep you lid on.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Actually, some laws can't be changed."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Today couldn't get any worse.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"It's not duck, it's chicken."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I'm afraid we are out of time.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I'm telling you. Life is a crapshoot.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Someone broke the glass ceiling again.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,You said you wanted your ashes spread in the Carribean?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"Argh, they are killing me -- they put soy instead of skim again."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,The Cubs are going to win it all.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Gimme a sec; it's just a mental block.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,and that should be the last thing on my list that's hanging over my head...
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,My mental block's a killer.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Yes I did say the food here is to die for.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,That sandwich is going to hit you like a falling cinderblock.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Did someone just yell heads up?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I hope I get his office.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Thank God my dad taught me to plan for the future.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I've finally made my peace with the man upstairs.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I expect the sword of Damocles to fall at any moment.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"God, schmod."
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I am just looking for a sign why we shouldn't invest in a Chipotle Franchise.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I'm a cartoonist. What do you do?
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,About that meeting...I don't think we have to worry.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,"My friends may threaten to BLOCK me, but I'm not going to stop sharing political posts on Facebook!"
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Let's get this to go.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I would try anything to get rid of my migraine.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,No. I haven't noticed an alarming increase in construction accidents.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,I just need a few days off.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,At least I get to choose my own provider.
2511,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,516,Did you tell me that you wrote a rather scathing article about Trump on Facebook!
