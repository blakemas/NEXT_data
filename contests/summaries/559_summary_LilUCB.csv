224,6,14,49,69,1.3768115942028984,0.07752965847636759,559,I'm gonna miss jolly Roger.
224,6,14,49,69,1.3768115942028984,0.07752965847636759,559,"Like I said, he could talk the talk but he couldn't walk the walk."
233,7,12,51,70,1.3714285714285714,0.07926011001713926,559,It's always about HIM
233,5,16,49,70,1.3714285714285714,0.07385125381489835,559,He's not taking this very seriously.
233,7,12,51,70,1.3714285714285714,0.07926011001713926,559,I told him he could choose the plank or 6 months in the Trump administration.
233,7,12,51,70,1.3714285714285714,0.07926011001713926,559,He said it was going to be his swan song.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,"Even now, he mocks me."
237,3,19,46,68,1.3676470588235294,0.06918696204926,559,I was hoping for a cannonball.
237,8,9,51,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0835568281559177,559,"With Drumpf as President, they just go willingly now."
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,He really is the most interesting man in the world.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,Always with the drama.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,"Yar, but I bet he splashes."
237,4,17,47,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07228981449955524,559,So that's why they call him Divey Jones.
237,8,9,51,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0835568281559177,559,The last Republican!
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,Blokes like him make me love what I do.
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,Arr! Must be one of them Disney pirates.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,Wow..I give it a 9 and a hook...
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,It's all in the execution mateys.
237,4,17,47,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07228981449955524,559,No more final requests.
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,"Arr... Perfect execution, for a perfect execution."
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,I knew piracy wasn't his passion.
237,8,9,51,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0835568281559177,559,We did meet him at a dive bar.
237,4,17,47,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07228981449955524,559,"Y'know, if he'd put that much effort into his work, he'd still have a job."
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,Another flawless execution!
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,Did you tell him those aren't dolphins?
237,4,17,47,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07228981449955524,559,He said he wanted to jump ship.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,"That's what we call ""The Swan Song Dive"""
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,"I think 'e went a bit overboard, no?"
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,I give this execution a 10.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,Who ordered the fiberglass plank?
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,That guy takes all the fun out of this.
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,"You remembered to take his treasure map, didn't you?"
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,Fitzmorris doesn't seem to grasp the gravity of the situation.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,8 point 5. 9 if he nails the entry.
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,I give him a Ten for his execution.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,I think he's had enough practice. The next one counts.
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,No more French pirates - I'm sick of their 'je ne sai quoi'
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,That's exactly why I want him out of here.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,Always less satisfying when they do that.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,I knew that last plank upgrade was a mistake.
237,8,9,51,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0835568281559177,559,"Step back men, he could still turn this into a cannonball."
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,Classy till the end.
237,8,9,51,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0835568281559177,559,Trump’s nominee for Navy secretary withdraws from consideration.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,It's hard to stay mad at him.
237,4,17,47,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07228981449955524,559,I think he took that rather well.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,I've never seen such a flawless execution.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,"I ordered him to shove-off, not show-off!"
237,4,17,47,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07228981449955524,559,Outstanding execution.
237,4,17,47,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07228981449955524,559,Everything's a competition with this guy.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,"Zero points for attempted mutiny, but ten points for the dive."
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,Good old Roger. Jolly til the end.
237,8,9,51,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0835568281559177,559,Now that's what I call a flawless execution.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,I don't think he gets the true spirit of walking the plank.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,Perfectly executed
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,He gets a bronze. I keep the gold and silver.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,Just one more reason to wish him dead.
237,6,13,49,68,1.3676470588235294,0.0781266945795663,559,"Five for difficulty, ten for attitude."
237,7,11,50,68,1.3676470588235294,0.08088734121420482,559,He's going for the gold.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,Have you noticed that the millennials have no respect for tradition.
237,5,15,48,68,1.3676470588235294,0.07526485795611701,559,Always a plankster
291,6,13,50,69,1.3623188405797102,0.07717026075112264,559,Makes you wonder if millennials respect any of our traditions.
291,4,17,48,69,1.3623188405797102,0.07143342512707324,559,From now on let's just say walk the plank.
291,5,15,49,69,1.3623188405797102,0.07435718986682269,559,Sort of defeats the purpose of the whole thing.
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,The rarely executed swan song dive.
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,His execution won't get better than that.
294,5,14,48,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07579368237090822,559,"You sure you explained ""walking the plank"" protocol?"
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,I think we should give him the gold!
294,5,14,48,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07579368237090822,559,"Aargh, execution perfect."
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,More swash... less bucklin'
294,5,14,48,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07579368237090822,559,Will ya look at that- still trying to get the gold.
294,2,20,45,67,1.3582089552238805,0.06624069885064139,559,I love a man who goes out in style!
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,I have a feeling he has done this before.
294,8,8,51,67,1.3582089552238805,0.08427060217218625,559,There goes another Trump nominee....
294,4,16,47,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07274887114566478,559,Man way overboard!
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,"Yeah, but can he swim?"
294,8,8,51,67,1.3582089552238805,0.08427060217218625,559,That's not what I meant by flawless execution.
294,9,6,52,67,1.3582089552238805,0.08691270577330147,559,No more crew applications from Penzance.
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,I'm old school. I like a tight cannonball.
294,5,14,48,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07579368237090822,559,I'd give him a 9.5 but with points off for execution
294,5,14,48,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07579368237090822,559,Talk about going overboard.
294,6,12,49,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07872081250670442,559,"Well, he always said he'd make a big splash!"
294,7,10,50,67,1.3582089552238805,0.08154293566023545,559,I wasn't quite expecting his swan song to be a swan dive.
294,4,16,47,67,1.3582089552238805,0.07274887114566478,559,Let's watch till that smart-ass finds out we're on a sand bar.
314,4,15,47,66,1.3484848484848484,0.07319681372567881,559,He makes being a pirate Great Again
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,It's called the Flying Dutchman.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,"A little overboard, no?"
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,I give him a deep six.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,No more espresso with the last meal !
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,"Mutinous to the end, I see."
314,7,9,50,66,1.3484848484848484,0.08219717110821467,559,Definitely a finalist.
314,4,15,47,66,1.3484848484848484,0.07319681372567881,559,It seems he's done this before.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,Beautiful execution.
314,7,9,50,66,1.3484848484848484,0.08219717110821467,559,Fred never grasped the essence of piracy.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,That's exactly what I always hated about him.
314,3,17,46,66,1.3484848484848484,0.06993978176539627,559,"When he said he wanted the gold, I didn't really know what he meant."
314,6,11,49,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0793106201715297,559,Only the French...
314,4,15,47,66,1.3484848484848484,0.07319681372567881,559,Such graceful execution!
314,4,15,47,66,1.3484848484848484,0.07319681372567881,559,Showoff! I said WALK the plank!
314,3,17,46,66,1.3484848484848484,0.06993978176539627,559,Tell the other Red Bull salesman he's up next.
314,6,11,49,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0793106201715297,559,I don't think we're reaching this guy.
314,4,15,47,66,1.3484848484848484,0.07319681372567881,559,He'll Neverland.
314,7,9,50,66,1.3484848484848484,0.08219717110821467,559,He takes all the fun out of it.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,He did everything with panache. I despise panache.
314,3,17,46,66,1.3484848484848484,0.06993978176539627,559,Looks like he's done this before.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,We should send a gold medal to his next of kin.
314,6,11,49,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0793106201715297,559,You've gotta love a guy who rises to the occasion.
314,3,17,46,66,1.3484848484848484,0.06993978176539627,559,Methinks it be a perfect execution all round.
314,3,17,46,66,1.3484848484848484,0.06993978176539627,559,"Less swash, more buckling."
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,So we're all in agreement – no more intern pirates from Stanford.
314,4,15,47,66,1.3484848484848484,0.07319681372567881,559,He wants to be the first mutineer on the front of a Wheaties box.
314,7,9,50,66,1.3484848484848484,0.08219717110821467,559,"Blimey! If he nails the entry, throw him a line."
314,7,9,50,66,1.3484848484848484,0.08219717110821467,559,He's enjoying that too much. Pull him in so I can hang him.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,"If he nails the entry, maybe I'll reconsider."
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,"Nice, but without leg irons the degree of difficulty is really low."
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,Too bad he never learned how to swim.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,Let's wait to see his splash before we start handing out scores
314,4,15,47,66,1.3484848484848484,0.07319681372567881,559,Shiver me timbers! That's what I call execution.
314,5,13,48,66,1.3484848484848484,0.0763149658048288,559,How am I supposed to follow that?
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"``Now nail the landing, you mutinous bastard.''"
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,They don't call him Jolly Roger for nothing.
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,His option was to be Trump's National Security Advisor....
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"Well, he did say he was going for the gold."
349,6,10,48,64,1.34375,0.08097480869293328,559,And that's why they called him Jolly Roger.
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,And how many more tryouts do we have?
349,7,8,49,64,1.34375,0.08398185154477655,559,The sharks don't care.
349,7,8,49,64,1.34375,0.08398185154477655,559,Now entering the sudden death portion of our competition.
349,7,8,49,64,1.34375,0.08398185154477655,559,"Tuck, you scalawag!"
349,3,16,45,64,1.34375,0.07119567686848623,559,Wait til he finds out we're ice-bound
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"Arg, but let's see if he can stick the landing."
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,"Arrrr! I said cannon ball, Matey."
349,6,10,48,64,1.34375,0.08097480869293328,559,"No way I'm beating that, just shoot me."
349,6,10,48,64,1.34375,0.08097480869293328,559,Nary a shark hath tasted such haughtiness in a swab.
349,3,16,45,64,1.34375,0.07119567686848623,559,I will hold my score until I judge his entry
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"And that, me boys, is grace under pressure."
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"Good elevation, knees together, nice arch. Now let's see if he can stick the entry."
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,I think he was lying when he said he couldn't swim.
349,3,16,45,64,1.34375,0.07119567686848623,559,"If he did it with a peg leg, then I'd be impressed."
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,This guy's gonna stick the drowning.
349,6,10,48,64,1.34375,0.08097480869293328,559,"Aye, too much shiver in that timber."
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,"Man, I really hate that guy."
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,I told him to take a flying leap.
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,Arr! From now on we just shoot the Millennials.
349,7,8,49,64,1.34375,0.08398185154477655,559,My plank walkers are the best. They are totally great. All the captives say they want to walk my plank. They actually thank me for it.
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,Oh No. He took the GPS.
349,2,18,44,64,1.34375,0.06762242718751049,559,"Blast him, he makes it look like fun."
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,Mutiny on the Bouncy!
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,The carbon fibre board does give a better bounce cap 'n.
349,3,16,45,64,1.34375,0.07119567686848623,559,"Aye, keel-hauling would have robbed us of his true talent."
349,7,8,49,64,1.34375,0.08398185154477655,559,He's taking this quite well ... don't you think?
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,"Yes, but he's a grog-snarfing scurvy dog with style."
349,3,16,45,64,1.34375,0.07119567686848623,559,"Given the circumstances, he is taking it quite well."
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,Something tells me we ain't heard the last of 'Divey' Jones.
349,7,8,49,64,1.34375,0.08398185154477655,559,Degree of difficulty: 1.6; Execution: A perfect 10
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"It figures that, just when we get rid of him, he shows talent."
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,Too much shiver in the timber.
349,3,16,45,64,1.34375,0.07119567686848623,559,We're gonna kick Blackbeard's ass at Regionals.
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,"Dammit, I said die, not dive!"
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"Last week, he couldn't even do a cannonball."
349,3,16,45,64,1.34375,0.07119567686848623,559,Maybe we should have just shot this one.
349,6,10,48,64,1.34375,0.08097480869293328,559,Too bad his swan dive is also his swan song.
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,We've gotta get a stiffer plank.
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,Arg! I knew Roger would remain jolly till the very end.
349,2,18,44,64,1.34375,0.06762242718751049,559,At least he died doing what he loved.
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,"I'd say he was a 2 in swashbuckling, but that dive is a solid 9."
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,He's going for gold.
349,6,10,48,64,1.34375,0.08097480869293328,559,Its his last chance for a perfect 10
349,6,10,48,64,1.34375,0.08097480869293328,559,"We should have been suspicious when he said, 'Whatever you do, don't make me walk the plank.'"
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,He did always know how to make an exit.
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,For a pirate he never could get the cannonball right.
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,He was always a glass-half-full kind of guy
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,And let it be known that his kisses were just as spectacular.
349,4,14,46,64,1.34375,0.07459796344937072,559,That swan dive is to die for!
349,7,8,49,64,1.34375,0.08398185154477655,559,"Say what you will about him, but I always admired his style and optimism."
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,Ya' can't be havin' em walk the plank this close to Miami.
349,8,6,50,64,1.34375,0.086884884386875,559,"Remember, Starbucks, a tall pumpkin spice latte, a grande caramel macchiato, and a venti butterscotch frappucino!"""
349,5,12,47,64,1.34375,0.07785170452100196,559,He STILL can't resist the opportunity to piss me off!
407,3,16,46,65,1.3384615384615384,0.07029102647114255,559,"Yes, quite lovely. But you know they all taste the same once they hit the water."
407,6,10,49,65,1.3384615384615384,0.07989453106861918,559,He volunteered when he heard the election results.
407,7,8,50,65,1.3384615384615384,0.08284868934053083,559,"We call ourselves pirates?!"" "" The gold medal is still around his neck!"
407,6,10,49,65,1.3384615384615384,0.07989453106861918,559,An execution well-executed.
407,1,20,44,65,1.3384615384615384,0.06308161333406433,559,"So that's what he meant by ""I'll take the gold!"""
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,He always went overboard in everything.
412,2,17,44,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06788442333021306,559,"I give it a 9.8, but I'm sure the sharks will score it as a 10."
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,Remind me to tie his hands and feet next time.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,How did you forget the cement blocks ?
412,7,7,49,63,1.3333333333333333,0.08466675133346033,559,I told him Trump won!
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,We can still take the silver.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,At least he died doing what he loved.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,That's what's called going out in style.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,I give him a ten for execution.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,I think he is taking his execution very well
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,Millenials are taking all the fun out of piracy.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,If only he had scrubbed the deck with the same flourish.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,"Yeah, but can he do it with a wooden leg?"
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,I KNEW he wasn't straight!
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"I must say, he's taking it VERY well."
412,7,7,49,63,1.3333333333333333,0.08466675133346033,559,"To make things worse, I think he also has my wallet."
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Maybe he knows something we don't?
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,This is why I am always saying we should just stab them.
412,1,19,43,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06400204809830924,559,Always had to have the last word!
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,"Yeah, but can he stick the landing?"
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,"Damn these hipsters. First it was the earrings, then the tattoos, now this."
412,1,19,43,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06400204809830924,559,"You're right. I did say ""surprise me."""
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,I'm guessing that's a no on joining our crew.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,The good news is that you've scored a perfect 10.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"Matey, get the man a towel, a proper speedo and all the steroids we have onboard; we're changing course."
412,7,7,49,63,1.3333333333333333,0.08466675133346033,559,": ""I said shove off, not showoff!"""
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,We also gave him the option of listening to a Trump stump speech.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,I give it a 9.8 for form and a perfect 10 for execution.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,Who knew?
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"Somehow, we didn't reach that guy."
412,2,17,44,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06788442333021306,559,Too bad we won't see that again.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Aaarrrggghhh! A near perfect execution.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,"Mutiny aside, Jeff never failed to dazzle a crowd."
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,"Umm, does he realize it's only 3 feet deep?"
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,I like his attitude.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,He's jumping ship!
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"If he nails the entry, I think we'll have a winner."
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,"Arrgh, I was expectin' a cannonball for certain."
412,7,7,49,63,1.3333333333333333,0.08466675133346033,559,The joke's on him: We're stuck on a reef.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,Sarcasm will get you nowhere!
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,"When he said he last served on the H.M.S. Pinafore, I should have known..."
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,I told you he would go overboard with it.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,His execution has always impressed me.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,"I'd say a ""10"" for style....and execution!"
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,"9.8 for form. ""0 for survival"
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Maybe we didn't have to tell him it's a qualifying event.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,That's the kind of sass that got him here.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Now THAT'S overboard!
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Should we have told him that we're stuck on a sandbar?
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,Gotta be from Penzance.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,"Nice, but do you really think the sharks care?"
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,That’s not the way you earn gold on this ship!
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,From now on they don't get a choice.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"Aye matey, Rafael always did have more swash than buckle!"
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Wait until he realizes the water is only 34 degrees.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,Kinda takes the fun out of it...
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,I'll give him a 10 for style and a 10 for stupid.
412,2,17,44,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06788442333021306,559,Now I feel guilty.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"Fine. Three flips, a twist, no splash, you can pull him back in."
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,He goes free if it's a perfect ten.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,I guess nobody told him about the sandbar.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,I figured he'd do a cannonball.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,Captain Jack then realized: walking the plank had lost it's horror....it was time for something new.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,Wow! Too late to get him back?
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"Anyone yells out a number, they're goin' in too."
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Flippant to the end.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,The degree of difficulty shivers me timbers.
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,Spring is in the air!
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,"THAT,,,,my friends, is how you walk the plank,,,,,"
412,2,17,44,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06788442333021306,559,Well. His name's Roger. And he is jolly.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,And that's why we had to get rid of him.
412,2,17,44,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06788442333021306,559,"From now on, blindfolds are mandatory."
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,"If he nails the entry, we get gold!"
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,"Tuck, scallywag, tuck!"
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,I get the feeling we're being mocked.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,I really hate cheerful people.
412,2,17,44,63,1.3333333333333333,0.06788442333021306,559,He takes walking the plank to new heights.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,Nobody embraces the moment like Roger.
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,"He's just different, I tried to tell you that."
412,6,9,48,63,1.3333333333333333,0.0815869230407957,559,These Trump appointees do like to go out in style. NEXT!
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,"Step back men, he could still turn this into a cannonball."
412,3,15,45,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07155646512351531,559,It's always about the gold.
412,4,13,46,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07504905376532171,559,They call him Long John Silver Medalist in diving.
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,and dont come back until your attitude has changed!
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,"Resumes are great, but never underestimate the interview process!"
412,5,11,47,63,1.3333333333333333,0.07838618016696206,559,I don't think he'll miss us.
498,5,11,48,64,1.328125,0.07732727648438203,559,It's that kind of behavior that got you in trouble in the first place!
498,4,13,47,64,1.328125,0.07405049589611347,559,God how I miss good old fashioned grovelling.
498,4,13,47,64,1.328125,0.07405049589611347,559,First one we've had with a sense of humor.
498,4,13,47,64,1.328125,0.07405049589611347,559,At least his execution is flawless.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,"Sublime elevation, extension... I mean, arrgh!"
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,He's in defiance again. I said walk.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,Walking the plank just isn't what it used to be.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,False start. You didn't wait for my third 'ho.'
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"Arrrggghhh, he is still going for the gold!"
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,I think he missed the point.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,He always did have a flair for the dramatic.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,He always had a flair for the dramatic.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,"Why, blow me down ... he's goin' fer the gold!"
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"Pretty good, but let's see if he sticks the landing."
502,6,8,48,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08219037872229688,559,"Aye, we'll bring home the gold one way or another."
502,2,16,44,62,1.3225806451612903,0.06811736515327178,559,That should really impress the sharks . .
502,6,8,48,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08219037872229688,559,Now that’s how you jump to a conclusion!
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"I told him this was his swan SONG, not his swan dive."
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,It's his swan song.
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,We'll see if he can stick the entry.
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,These Price Waterhouse guys sure do love the spot light.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,I wish he had displayed that type of je ne sais quoi while swabbing the deck.
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"Not what I meant when I said ""no more cannonballs""."
502,7,6,49,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08534681648595453,559,They're everywhere since the circus closed.
502,7,6,49,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08534681648595453,559,I'm so done with 'Penzance'
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,He always wanted to go out on a high note.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,"8.0, 7.5, 8.5."
502,2,16,44,62,1.3225806451612903,0.06811736515327178,559,"Aye, he's going for the gold."
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,He wants to go out with a splash.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,And I thought he'd stolen that gold medal...
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,Ever the Goddamn optimist!
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"Impressive, yes, but let's see how he does in the keel hauling competition."
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,Good execution. I give it a 9.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,Tell the plankmaster a little less give on the next one.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,He's going for the gold.
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"They say he stole the gold, but I think he won fair and square."
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,We just wanted him to WALK the plank.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,I think we've found our next Press Secretary!
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,Nice execution. Not what I had in mind though.
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"Not bad, but I'm partial to the armstand back double somersault with a twist."
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"And that, gentlemen, is the definition of ""panache""!"
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,Does he know we're in the shallow end?
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,The kid had style. I'll give him that.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,What do you mean you don't want the job?
502,7,6,49,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08534681648595453,559,It's to distract the press while we pillage.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,"Argh! 'Tis a pity... Such talent, but soooo annoying."
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,Same sharks no matter how he does it.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,"Call me old-fashioned, but I like it better when they fall to their knees and beg for their lives."
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,He only ever thought of pirating as a springboard.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,Sublimey!
502,2,16,44,62,1.3225806451612903,0.06811736515327178,559,Remember when walking the plank was a solemn occasion?
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,"Yarr, thar goes Divey Jones."
502,6,8,48,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08219037872229688,559,In the shark community we're known for our presentation.
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,That's the last time we show those Esther Williams movies.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,"Swan song, not swan dive."
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,"Wait, that's not a cannonball..."
502,6,8,48,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08219037872229688,559,Hey! This ain't no Carnival Cruise ship!
502,7,6,49,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08534681648595453,559,Shiver me swimmers.
502,2,16,44,62,1.3225806451612903,0.06811736515327178,559,Death with dignity
502,6,8,48,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08219037872229688,559,He gets a 10 if he nails the entry.
502,4,12,46,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07548256020412515,559,"Say what you will, he put the 'jolly' in 'Jolly Roger.'"
502,3,14,45,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07189434028626156,559,Get changed. Synchronized swimming is next.
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,Does he know we've run aground?
502,7,6,49,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08534681648595453,559,He's done this before.
502,6,8,48,62,1.3225806451612903,0.08219037872229688,559,"Good form. He's look at posthumous silver, maybe posthumous gold."
502,5,10,47,62,1.3225806451612903,0.07890777924097209,559,I don't think he took this seriously.
564,5,10,48,63,1.3174603174603174,0.07781382071333852,559,"I know, but he wasn't a team player."
564,5,10,48,63,1.3174603174603174,0.07781382071333852,559,"Finally ,someone who appreciates the moment"
564,4,12,47,63,1.3174603174603174,0.0744510438067211,559,Another one to jump ship. Horrible dive; horrible. The absolute worst dive ever.
564,4,12,47,63,1.3174603174603174,0.0744510438067211,559,Anybody else wanna talk about gay rights?
564,4,12,47,63,1.3174603174603174,0.0744510438067211,559,"Good form, bad timing."
564,5,10,48,63,1.3174603174603174,0.07781382071333852,559,"This time, we won't pick him up!"
564,5,10,48,63,1.3174603174603174,0.07781382071333852,559,"They call that one ""the dying swan dive."""
564,5,10,48,63,1.3174603174603174,0.07781382071333852,559,I just asked him to give me a cannonball.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,He's determined to get gold one way or another.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,It's a shame that we've run aground.
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,"It's a 4.9 out of 5, but he's still eliminated!"
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,I hate a show-off.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,Does he know something we don't know?
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,I give his demise an 8.5
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,Not bad for someone who can't swim.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"Oh great, now everyone is going to want to mutiny."
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,"I said, ""walk it"" not ""work it""!"
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,No more rum as a last request!
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,Last time we shanghai Cirque du Soleil.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,I'm guessing this was not his first offense?
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,feet together....toes pointed.....should score well
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"Now, if he can only stick the landing."
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"And get this, earlier he was ironing his clothes on it too."
572,6,7,48,61,1.3114754098360655,0.08278282736362359,559,He's as disgrace! A true pirates would have done a cannonball!
572,6,7,48,61,1.3114754098360655,0.08278282736362359,559,Nope - still too much spring.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"If it helps, that's a ten."
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,That's why he wanted the plank installed?
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,The judges will still penalize him for being eaten.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,"No, no, no. I said this was your swan song, not your swan dive."
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,I wonder if he knows we are on a sandbar?
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,It's a new dive called the swan song!
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,Let's see him do that with a wooden leg.
572,1,17,43,61,1.3114754098360655,0.06419311543426628,559,"Wow, that plank has more spring to it than I thought."
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,Talk about a positive attitude.
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,He never was a cannonball kind of guy.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,Some guys like to go out with a splash.
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,"Shiver Me Timbers! Excellent arch on the back, but can he minimize the splash?"
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,I'll miss his well choreographed song and dance routines
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,Haul him back in and see how he does on the 10m platform from the crow's nest.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,"I said swan song, not swan dive!"
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,Call me old fashion but I prefer the cannonball.
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,MAN OVERDONE!
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,Argh. Here there be showoffs.
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,"Yar, I noticed that too, this IS a lot easier with married men"
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,We'll not shanghai crewmen at San Francisco ever again!
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,All I ever ask for is a cannonball...
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,20 doubloons he belly flops.
572,0,19,42,61,1.3114754098360655,0.059785516487903166,559,I'd like to see him try that with a peg leg.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,What part of 'walk the plank' did you not understand?
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,I'll give that dive a 7 for difficulty and a 10 for execution.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"Get him back. He's making a mockery of ""walk the plank""."
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,Roger is a bit too jolly.
572,6,7,48,61,1.3114754098360655,0.08278282736362359,559,"Height 10, style 10, screaming, pleading, begging, zero."
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,Keep dragging him back till he gets it RIGHT!
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,What part of 'walk the plank' did you not understand?
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,"Medals are nice, but I miss the screams."
572,6,7,48,61,1.3114754098360655,0.08278282736362359,559,"Aaarrrrh, 9.3 ."
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,"I admire his bravado, but the water's only a foot deep."
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,It don't look very death-defying to me.
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,Do you think our severance package is too generous?
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,This guy is really taking the fun out of it.
572,6,7,48,61,1.3114754098360655,0.08278282736362359,559,"OK, but can he swim?"
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,...and don't come back.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,Don't you think you're going a little overboard?
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,Arrrgh! There be fine line between bravely facing death and just showing off.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,Nailed it!
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"You are hereby charged with lying, stealing, mutiny and ... ah, extreme narcissism."
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"""Swan song"", buddy, not ""swan dive""!"
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,That's exactly why he had to walk the plank.
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,"When he said he was desperate to take gold, I think he meant something different..."
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,That was well executed.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,"Well, I give him a 10 for execution."
572,5,9,47,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07941377977960633,559,He's jumping to conclusions.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,Argh! He's going to over-rotate.
572,3,13,45,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07220562473949259,559,I gotta work on my 'Walk the plank' instructions.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"We lied... This is your only try, no way to get back on board."
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,I just felt a shiver in me timbers.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,"There goes the chum. Get out your rods, boys."
572,2,15,44,61,1.3114754098360655,0.0683169390165333,559,Not what I had in mind when he asked for death with dignity.
572,4,11,46,61,1.3114754098360655,0.07589532483264116,559,That didn't go the way I expected...
644,5,9,48,62,1.3064516129032258,0.07828377806886798,559,Argh...another swan song.
644,5,9,48,62,1.3064516129032258,0.07828377806886798,559,He never did fit with the corporate culture here.
644,1,17,44,62,1.3064516129032258,0.06334877259778084,559,Now that's going out with style.
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,Have to give him credit for going out in style.
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,He's going for gold.
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,Wait-- didn't HE have the keys last?!
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Aaargh! He's planking the walk!
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,Such grace for a treacherous yellow-bellied scoundrel.
647,7,4,49,60,1.3,0.086684048669783,559,Suicides have become more spectacular since January 20.
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,We should have used the 10-meter plank.
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,His crime...arrogance
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,We treasure moments like this
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,"Well, he's just showing off now."
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,He said he wanted to go out in style!
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,I'll give him a 10 if he lands in that shark's mouth.
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,"What part of ""walk the plank"" didn't you understand?"
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,I told him this was his 'swan' song !
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,Who installed the springboard?
647,1,16,43,60,1.3,0.06422066478409214,559,"Lower a ladder, me hardies. Let's have him do that again."
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,All I said was we're outta rum.
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,"Arrrgh! I said your swan song, not your swan dive!"
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,That's exactly why I made him walk the plank in the first place.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Arrg!! So overboard about everything!!
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,Remind me never to recruit at Juilliard again.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Aargh. Tell the crew that Mr. Louganis be no longer with us.
647,6,6,48,60,1.3,0.08336157713463008,559,That's the jolliest I've ever seen Roger.
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,The ultimate swan song
647,6,6,48,60,1.3,0.08336157713463008,559,If only he put the same effort into swabbing the deck.
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,There's no points for style
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,We never should have become pirates in Neverland.
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,I knew it. Take urine samples from the crew.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,"Truth be told, I think we're all going to miss his ""glass-half-full"" attitude."
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,"When I said swan song, I was being figurative."
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,He takes planking to a whole new level.
647,6,6,48,60,1.3,0.08336157713463008,559,I'm predicting a 10 from the Russian judge.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Damn...we should have kept him for the diving team.
647,6,6,48,60,1.3,0.08336157713463008,559,"See, there's that arrogance I was talking about."
647,1,16,43,60,1.3,0.06422066478409214,559,"Aarg, but can he nail the entry?"
647,6,6,48,60,1.3,0.08336157713463008,559,"Don't worry--if the sharks don't finish him off, lack of affordable health care will."
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,Best performance by an Oscar accountant.
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,"Do you see how he pointed his toes, that is what I am talking about."
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,The French always have to be so damned dramatic!
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,The fake news is calling it a swan dive.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,There for the grace of Todd...goes Todd.
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,He's going for a double plank with a half twist.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,We need a stiffer plank.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Write if you find work.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,I said die not dive !
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,Find out what antidepressant he's been on!
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,"Under the circumstances, you have to appreciate the irony of his choosing to do a swan dive."
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,"Arr, but the degree of difficulty be low."
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,"Aye, silver. Gold if he nails the landing."
647,6,6,48,60,1.3,0.08336157713463008,559,Said his name was Louganis.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,I just asked him if he wanted to be Secretary of the Navy.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,"Look, this time he's doing a one-and-a-half Barnacle Bill with a double twist. Fish him out again."
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,"I think he misunderstood me when I said 'This is your swan song."""
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,Not only did he take it like a man but he attempted to do a straight position with an open pike and a slight arch!
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,I like his attitude.
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,"Point your toes, POINT YOUR TOES, SMILE!"
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,Th' legend be alive! 'Tis the flying Dutchman.
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,Argh! Everything is turning into a musical these days!
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Classy. A swan dive as his swan song.
647,6,6,48,60,1.3,0.08336157713463008,559,"Kind of puts the ""curve"" in ""scurvy"", doesn't it?"
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,"I said, 'Shiver me timber', not 'Show me you're limber'."
647,1,16,43,60,1.3,0.06422066478409214,559,"Fine with me, I've seen enough cannonballs."
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,Now you're just being a jerk.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Now that’s how you jump to a conclusion!
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,"My God, the first 10.0"
647,3,12,45,60,1.3,0.07248611789946811,559,Nobody out-jollies our Roger.
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,He may dive like a swan but can he swim with the sharks?
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,I think we're both satisfied with the execution!
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,He called me Ishmael.
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,Now that's 'irrational exuberance'
647,5,8,47,60,1.3,0.07990106877232901,559,Keep those toes pointed!
647,4,10,46,60,1.3,0.0762837403353298,559,...but he'll never make the finals.
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,His other option was watching Trump address Congress.
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,Wait 'til he finds out this is the shallow end.
647,2,14,44,60,1.3,0.06847821213147406,559,"Quite the swan song, eh mateys?"
722,3,12,46,61,1.2950819672131149,0.07145735973017497,559,"Frankly, I always thought Roger was a little TOO jolly."
722,3,12,46,61,1.2950819672131149,0.07145735973017497,559,"He knows there are sharks in the water, right?"
722,3,12,46,61,1.2950819672131149,0.07145735973017497,559,Nobody likes a showoff!
722,4,10,47,61,1.2950819672131149,0.0751837904540555,559,He's gone off the deep end.
722,3,12,46,61,1.2950819672131149,0.07145735973017497,559,"Yes, he was a theivin' scalawag, but he was also the Captain of our Diving Team."
722,4,10,47,61,1.2950819672131149,0.0751837904540555,559,I like a man who goes out with style!
722,2,14,45,61,1.2950819672131149,0.06752559642221562,559,"In my day, we did cannonballs."
722,1,16,44,61,1.2950819672131149,0.06335028085765876,559,He always did have style.
722,5,8,48,61,1.2950819672131149,0.07873404876208907,559,"Excellent height, feet t'gether. I be thinkin' we got a real chance o' winnin' this year."
722,3,12,46,61,1.2950819672131149,0.07145735973017497,559,I rest my case.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,We seem to have lost the deterrent effect.
732,6,5,48,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08392353905627811,559,Perfect ten for execution
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,This is the last time he demands a Matinee on the Bounty.
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,They can keep the gold medals; that is the last time we plunder an Olympic village.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,You gotta give him points for style.
732,1,15,43,59,1.2881355932203389,0.06419417986088129,559,It would have been a graceful mutiny.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,"""You can stay if you want,but I'm abandoning the Trumptanic before it hits the iceberg""."
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,I'd give it an eight but the sharks are giving it a ten.
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,"I told you to tie Peter Pan to a boulder, Smee."
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,He gets a lot of loft from that extra leg.
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,"I said 'sleep with the fishes,' not 'dive with the swans!'"
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,I knew we should have tied his hands.
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,He'll be a lot less cocky in a second when he realizes we're in shallow waters.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,I hope that damn crocodile is nearby.
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,If only we could execute like him.
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,This is gonna ruin our reputation
732,0,17,42,59,1.2881355932203389,0.059467967781548434,559,He said walking the plank was beneath him
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,That's great but can he swim?
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,"Presentation - 10, Technical Merit - 10, Chance of Survival - 0."
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,Some people take the fun out of everything.
732,6,5,48,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08392353905627811,559,This keeps happening every time we tell them we're going to Mar-a-Lago.
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,See now this is the very behavior I'm talking about!
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,I give him a ten if he survives. The water is only three feet deep there.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,"Aye, I give him a nine!"
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,"If anyone asks, he was pushed."
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,We'll see if he can stick the entry.
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,Now that's going out with style.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,He was becoming a distraction.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,That's definitely a swan song.
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,"Arrrrrrr, mastered th' art 'o losin' gracefully he has!"
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,Isn't it early to be leaving the Administration?
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,Inventory the opium!
732,6,5,48,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08392353905627811,559,"Good form, but he's still a mutinous dog."
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,"In his exit interview, I encouraged him to focus on the journey, not the destination."
732,6,5,48,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08392353905627811,559,"Good height, nice artistic form, I give it an 8."
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,We've been had.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,I'll bet ya he can't do that again.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,He hasn't been the same since he saw that summer production of 'Pirates of Penzance.'
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,The execution was a perfect 10.
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,Fish him out and do it over until he gets it right.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,I told him it was his swan SONG.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,"Spring Break, Bermuda, 1695. YOLO."
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,I don't think that's the last we will see of the dread Pirate Louganis.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,"Looks like a 1.3 degree of difficulty, but a 10 for execution."
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,Forget the sharks! It’s the Russian judge he’s got to worry about!
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,Anyone that competent has no place in my administration.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,I give him a 7 out of 10 for the delivery and a 9 out of 10 for the execution of his execution.
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,"Next time, I thinks we should tie his hands behind his back!"
732,6,5,48,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08392353905627811,559,We need to stop taking Olympians hostage.
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,Happy? You just ruined a really nice execution.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,I just told him about the immigration ban.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,"Wrong movie, you idiot!"
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,I don't care for the way he jumped ship.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,The sharks are doing backflips right now.
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,He's taking the fun out of pirating.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,"Of course, they never do it when you ask."
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,Fletcher always had to have the last word.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,I expected nothing less from a millennial.
732,6,5,48,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08392353905627811,559,His critics at going to eat him alive.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,And he steals the gold!
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,"Hands, hands. We tie the hands."
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,And that is exactly why he was never going to make it as a pirate.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,"Yarr, beautiful execution."
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,"Once a wise-ass, always a wise-ass."
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,"Ok, we'll throw out the low score and the high score"
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,He surprised be. I thought he'd go with the inward 2 1/2 in the pike position.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,He's been pirating a lot of gymnastics videos.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,nine-point-arrgh!
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,He's never really been part of the crew.
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,"See how it's done? OK, Stubbs, you're next."
732,4,9,46,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07664367772910466,559,"I told him 'swan song,' not 'swan dive.'"
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,"Arrrr, another gangprank."
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,"He had to go, but I am gonna miss his attitude."
732,1,15,43,59,1.2881355932203389,0.06419417986088129,559,He's on performance enhancement rum.
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,That one's just right. Have it installed on my pool.
732,6,5,48,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08392353905627811,559,It's either the plank or a Cabinet Position...
732,3,11,45,59,1.2881355932203389,0.07273100989192272,559,Well that takes the fun out of this!
732,2,13,44,59,1.2881355932203389,0.0685955265593542,559,"He said that if he was going to sleep with the fishes, it wouldn't hurt to try to impress 'em a little first."
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,Joke's on him. We're aground. A foot o' water waitin' on him.
732,5,7,47,59,1.2881355932203389,0.08036608035599811,559,So that's how he got his gold.

817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,I'll give a him a 9.5 for form but just 3 for swashbuckling.
817,1,14,42,57,1.280701754385965,0.06505437269382161,559,"First the annoying jazz hands, and now this!"
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,Won't let us forget he trained at Juilliard.

817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,I don't think he appreciates the gravity of the situation
817,6,4,47,57,1.280701754385965,0.08581901588102221,559,The word ye boys be seekin' is 'elan'
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,He wanted to die a graceful death.
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,Remind me again why we use a plank?
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,"Well, you've got to admire his form."
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,No way he sticks the landing.
817,6,4,47,57,1.280701754385965,0.08581901588102221,559,"Who's got your gold medal now, showoff?"
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,WOW! I hope he hits the landing.
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,I got a doubloon that says he nails the entry.
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,If there is no splash bring him back aboard.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,And yet he would never do a cannonball when I asked for one.
817,6,4,47,57,1.280701754385965,0.08581901588102221,559,"His last chance at a ten, boys, and I think he hit it."
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,It's all about them now.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,I hate it when we capture an Olympic schooner.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,I give him a 10 for execution but only an 8 for degree of difficulty. What say ye?
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,A willing martyr takes all the fun out of it.
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,"Blast, he really is Peter Pan!"
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,Now that's what I call going in style.
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,"All right, mateys, we quit raiding Acapulco."
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,His back is a bit over-arched. That's really going to hurt his score from the Russian pirates.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,"Let the record show, he took the blows and did it his way."
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,He's been doing that every day since the Ringling brothers went under.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,Wish I had an aye phone.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,I wanna be that high some day.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,He always was a cheeky bastard!
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,"Well, blow me down. He ain't a landlubber after all."
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,I told him he could walk the plank of his gender preference.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,I said I was going to enjoy watching him die.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,I said WALK the plank!
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,This is his final dive of the competition.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,Clearly not the first time he's walked the plank.
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,He's no Jackknife Sparrow.
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,10. 10. 10.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,He still thinks everybody gets a trophy.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,Johnson always saw the glass as half full.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,At least it explains the Speedos.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,Blimey! 9.2 for execution.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,We should have known he was a flight risk.
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,I guess when we go low they go high.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,"Blimey! I said, ""prepare your swan song, not your swan dive!"""
817,6,4,47,57,1.280701754385965,0.08581901588102221,559,"Excellent dive, chum."
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,When life gives you lemons...
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,"I said, 'Die scum!' Not, 'Dive scum!'"
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,We really need a stiffer plank
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,A show off to the very end.
817,1,14,42,57,1.280701754385965,0.06505437269382161,559,I'm kinda sorry to see him go.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,But the envelope said La La Land
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,"Okay okay, maybe it really was Greg Louganis."
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,What's the punishment for not following instructions?
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,I shouldn't have lent him my copy of 'Peter Pan.'
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,"Hence the nickname, Jolly Roger."
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,I guess he wanted to go out in style.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,The takeoff was high enough but there's too much bend in his back.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,I don't know...Long John Silver has a guy who can do a 9.5.
817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,I'm going to miss Jolly Roger.
817,1,14,42,57,1.280701754385965,0.06505437269382161,559,Now if only his fencing were as good.
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,Those Disney movies took all the fun out of being a pirate.
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,And that is why we bind their limbs.
817,3,10,44,57,1.280701754385965,0.0740621646906627,559,This new plank technology is going to revolutionize the industry.
817,5,6,46,57,1.280701754385965,0.08208737461234245,559,You think he's trying to tell us something?

817,2,12,43,57,1.280701754385965,0.0697039297502425,559,He lives for this.
817,4,8,45,57,1.280701754385965,0.07817781433825675,559,Now that's _exactly_ the kind of attitude I was talking about.

930,2,12,44,58,1.2758620689655173,0.06866237064311606,559,I was hoping that he'd go for a cannon ball.

942,5,5,46,56,1.2678571428571428,0.08253716765510495,559,"Good form, but what about the execution?"
942,4,7,45,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07850498961961752,559,"As Roger happily flew to his death, Blackbeard thought of a cool nickname for his flag."

942,4,7,45,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07850498961961752,559,I'll give him a 10 for execution.
942,2,11,43,56,1.2678571428571428,0.06974476393590386,559,At least someone's execution was flawless.
942,3,9,44,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07425417662209718,559,I asked for a CANNONBALL!

942,3,9,44,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07425417662209718,559,Might as well make a splash.
942,2,11,43,56,1.2678571428571428,0.06974476393590386,559,Typical Dutchman.

942,3,9,44,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07425417662209718,559,I'd say an 8. Maybe 8.5.

942,3,9,44,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07425417662209718,559,Perhaps he was the true treasure we've been seeking all along.
942,2,11,43,56,1.2678571428571428,0.06974476393590386,559,I get the feeling he's done this before.

942,3,9,44,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07425417662209718,559,I'd give him a piece of 8.6 for that one.
942,1,13,42,56,1.2678571428571428,0.06492288846873887,559,I should have known this would happen when he danced the plank.
942,4,7,45,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07850498961961752,559,He needs a 10 to stay alive!
942,4,7,45,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07850498961961752,559,"Nice, but he can't swim."

942,3,9,44,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07425417662209718,559,Figured he go with a cannonball.
942,2,11,43,56,1.2678571428571428,0.06974476393590386,559,He needs a perfect dive to make the medal round.
942,4,7,45,56,1.2678571428571428,0.07850498961961752,559,No scores until he hits the water!
942,2,11,43,56,1.2678571428571428,0.06974476393590386,559,I thought we were discussing a swan SONG?

1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,Nice take off but will he stick the landing?
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"Aye, we’ll be scrapping the suggestion box."

1077,1,12,42,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06470956516382613,559,I can see daylight between his ankles. Argh! That'll be a 9.4 at best.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Much better than the entertainment on our last cruise.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,Why does everybody have to make a big deal out of everything?

1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,Let's wait til we see his entrance.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,See? That is exactly what we were talking about!
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,Pity that he chose a life of crime over the Olympics.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Looks like he's going for pirate gold.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,I hate show offs.

1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"There we go, one less loose cannon."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"He was ordered to walk the plank, but Blacky always has to do things his way."
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"Well, you were right about the liquor ration."

1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,And the gold goes to...us.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Talk about hang time!
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,I upgraded to a springboard.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,He mentioned something about a half gainer with a full twist...
1077,1,12,42,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06470956516382613,559,Why aren't we using this guy?

1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,Nice to deal with a real professional for a change.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"I'm sorry, the difficulty just isn't there."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Now I remember why we don't do this so close to land.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,And they say quitters never win.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"Yeah, he's auditioning for that Penzance thing."
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,I give that a 10/10
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"Arrr, next time we throw him from the 30-meter platform and see how he fare!"
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"On second thought, I don't think the punishment fits the crime."
1077,1,12,42,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06470956516382613,559,"When he comes back on board, check for steroids."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Nobody likes a smartass.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,I don't think we're getting through to him.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,You'll never hear the name 'Louganis' again.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,I take it all back... Throw him the buoy.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,"And by the way, Jones, there's a shark down there getting bored with his mannequin."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"So far, he is flawless."
1077,1,12,42,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06470956516382613,559,What a Swan Song.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,We'll have the last laugh when he sees the reef.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"10 for style, 0 for brains."
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,That's the last time we recruit from the circus!
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,It's his cannonball that really knocks 'em dead.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"8.5, 9, 9.1 matey"
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,I hate perfection!
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,So this is why we use the blindfold.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,So that was why he wanted to install the plank
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,9.5
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"Well, he was always one to go a bit overboard, wasn't he..."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Rare image of the Brits leaving the EU.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,It's no fun to kill 'em when they show off like that.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Now you see why I needed to set him free...
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"So that's what they mean by "" last swan dive"""
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,He wants to make planking cool again.
1077,1,12,42,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06470956516382613,559,"In fairness, I did tell him to go overboard"
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,He'd do anything to get out of swabbing the deck.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,I knew he'd do this! That's why I parked in 3 feet of water !
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,So that's where he got the gold.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Must be an Olympic year.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,He could never control himself in front of an audience.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,Consider this your swan song
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"Damn it, he never takes me seriously."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,I told him he would be judged.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,But can he do a cannonball?
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,Five doubloons says he won't stick the landing
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Ahoy there Matey. No one likes a smart ass!
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,Clueless to the end.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"Well, there goes our best chance at the Olympics this year"
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,We need to find a tougher punishment.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,I'm glad the mutiny hasn't dampened his spirits.
1077,5,4,46,55,1.2545454545454546,0.08295137441473863,559,"Christ, what an asshole!"
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"A 10 for execution, eh?"
1077,5,4,46,55,1.2545454545454546,0.08295137441473863,559,His first dive was better.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,So much for Jolly Roger.
1077,1,12,42,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06470956516382613,559,He's taking it well.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Killjoy!
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,"Well, I guess we know who stole the lime juice."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,He always went for the gold.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"Given the circumstances, I'd of preferred a cannon ball."
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,I suppose this wasn't the right punishment for him.
1077,0,14,41,55,1.2545454545454546,0.059278386873217015,559,"No, even if you stick the entry, there is NO next round."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,I think he misunderstands the concept.
1077,2,10,43,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06971892495651474,559,Now that's what I call a death defying leap.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,That is the difference between a board and a plank.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,"Well, he's certainly got chutzpah."
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,I told you we shouldn't have let him watch 'Peter Pan'.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,Walk the Plank is supposed to be fun for US.
1077,3,8,44,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0743917278364524,559,Synchronized is next up.
1077,1,12,42,55,1.2545454545454546,0.06470956516382613,559,Somehow I think he'll land on his feet.
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,"Finally, a plank salesman that understands our business"
1077,5,4,46,55,1.2545454545454546,0.08295137441473863,559,"Finally gets his ""TEN"" when he's being Deep-Sixed!"
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,"Tuck, you bastard! Tuck!"
1077,4,6,45,55,1.2545454545454546,0.0787878787878788,559,I bet he's been doping.

1281,2,9,43,54,1.2407407407407407,0.06961602376844407,559,"I say next time, we just stick with keel-hauling."
1281,3,7,44,54,1.2407407407407407,0.07446611836866017,559,He should have gone for the cannonball.

1281,2,9,43,54,1.2407407407407407,0.06961602376844407,559,Pity. He coulda been a contender.

1281,2,9,43,54,1.2407407407407407,0.06961602376844407,559,It loses its fun when they start to make it their own.
1281,2,9,43,54,1.2407407407407407,0.06961602376844407,559,I’ll miss that sight of him walking the deck in his tutu.

1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,"He's not supposed to do that, is he?"
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,"Sure, but how will he perform on platform?"

1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Why exactly did we decide to use the fiberglass plank?
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,That's the last order he'll disobey on this ship.

1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Approach was shaky but great execution.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Can we go back to calling it a plank?
1394,0,12,41,53,1.2264150943396226,0.058037007324041226,559,I'm still not sure he knew what we meant by pirate booty.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,7.5 for execution; 2.8 for difficulty

1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,I really think we lost sight of something important when we introduced style points.
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,Fish him out... We need him for our dive team.
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,I ordered him to WALK the plank.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,9.5! Much better than yesterday.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Must really be certain about the afterlife!

1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,He said he wants to pursue other opportunities.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Show off.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,That bastard just took all the fun out of it
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,"When he saw our new health care plan, he volunteered."
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Punishing homosexuality isn't what it used to be.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,From now on hobble them.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,One and done.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I always feel robbed by the few who embrace their destiny.
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,I betcha two bits he over-rotates.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Come on...it's his last dive and he cops out with a 0.7 degree of difficulty?
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Trust me. This is gonna clinch our bid for the 2024 olympics.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,We should have used him for his cannoonball
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Hey! That was supposed to be a reverse pike.
1394,5,2,46,53,1.2264150943396226,0.08364652559314256,559,Turns out he was the treasure this whole time.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Not as satisfying as I would have hoped...
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,"If not us, then the execution scores will kill him."
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Go get a musket. I think he's caught a thermal.
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,With that kind of move he'll never get the gold.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Pity. He was our best chance to medal at the Pirate Games.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,That's not a cannonball.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Just like the scurvy dog to ruin the moment for everyone else.
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,Quite a swan song!
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,These guys that live in the moment are ruining it for the rest of us.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I thought he was supposed to do a half gainer.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I prefer his cannonball.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,He never learned that pirates just aren't amused by irony.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,We never should have stopped in Rio.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,"Man, over bored."
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,"Even to the end, a damned showoff."
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,"He's got great form, but can he stick the landing?"
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I had to get rid of him because he was always trying to one-up me!
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,"The form is good, but that lack of height is gonna cost him."
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,We never have enough gold!
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I hate it when they don't take me seriously...
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,Blimey!That lad's got a great future ahead of him!
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,Isn't plank a holding pose?
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Maybe we should have just cooked him?
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,"Yeah, well, the sharks aren't impressed."

1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,Style? I'll give him points for execution.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Who does he think he is ...the pirate of penzance?
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,"Aye, mateys! Ten for form, but sharks’ bait still."

1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,His perky attitude was drivin' me bonkers.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,That's what I call going down with in style.

1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,That's what I call death with dignity.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,It's his swan dive swan song.

1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,"He may be a rotten pirate, but he sure is one hell of a diver."
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I'm stumped.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,We make him walk for bad attitude and we get this...

1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Great talent! Just not cut out to be a pirate.
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,Do you think he's unhappy here?
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Impressive arrrrrc.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,"He wasn't a real pirate, he just played one on TV."
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,"You idiot! I said, Jones the conniver, not Jones the diver."
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,"Say what you will about Randy, he's always known how to make an exit."
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,Too bad he ain't gonna get an encore.
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,This wasn't supposed to be a springboard to success!
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Death isn't the deterrent it was before November.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I'll give him a 9.5 for that execution.
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,MERMAIDS!!!
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,He wasn't a good fit with our culture anyway.
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,Why couldn't he walk the plank like everyone else?
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,"He gets 4.0 for style, 1.0 for understanding the concept."
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,Pirate of pizzazzance.
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,I didn't have the heart to tell him we haven't left the dock yet and it's only five feet of water.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,It's a pity he couldn't peel potatoes that well.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Gold
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,I say a 9.0 and anyone who says otherwise is a dirty landlubber
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,"Wait, I've seen this before. Search for the droid!"
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,The sharks call this one Fancy Feast

1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,That is definitely a 9.9 dive!
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,He said he was the Dread Pirate Louganis.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,You didn't tell me he was an Aculpoco pirate.
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,You can't fire me! I quit!

1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,I'd give it a piece of eight point five.
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,Who's bright idea was it to make Greg Louganis walk the plank?
1394,1,10,42,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06398424512382328,559,Workplace satisfaction just isn't what it used to be.
1394,4,4,45,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07918997309552243,559,I simply suggested we hold a Town Hall meeting.
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,We'll get a laugh when he sees we're stranded on a sand bar.
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,Aargh. A shame we'll never get to see his reverse pike.
1394,5,2,46,53,1.2264150943396226,0.08364652559314256,559,He said his name was Phelps.

1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,"To air is human, forgive his dive."
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,"Arrrrr! Three sheets to the wind, and still a perfect 10."
1394,2,8,43,53,1.2264150943396226,0.06942386498172073,559,He's jumping the shark!
1394,3,6,44,53,1.2264150943396226,0.07446719031852134,559,I kinda figured he was gay.
1542,3,6,45,54,1.2222222222222223,0.0731953469605706,559,The Russian judge gave hime a 9.5.
1542,2,8,44,54,1.2222222222222223,0.06825501298155012,559,As I said. Too much drama.
1542,1,10,43,54,1.2222222222222223,0.06292801266165045,559,Form and function. He's got it all.

1542,3,6,45,54,1.2222222222222223,0.0731953469605706,559,"Top marks for presentation, and the entrée is to die for!"
1542,1,10,43,54,1.2222222222222223,0.06292801266165045,559,"He deserved his punishment, but I'm gonna miss First Mate Louganis"
1542,1,10,43,54,1.2222222222222223,0.06292801266165045,559,Now THAT'S walking the plank.
1542,2,8,44,54,1.2222222222222223,0.06825501298155012,559,He always was a non-conformist.
1542,1,10,43,54,1.2222222222222223,0.06292801266165045,559,It's not a ten until he comes up and lights a cigar.
1551,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,559,Cut! Mutiny on the set.
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,"If you've got it, flaunt it."
1551,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,559,I told him it was Olympic tryouts.
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,He respectfully declined the cabinet position.
1551,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,559,That wasn't what we had in mind when we said we were considering your execution.
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,No one can say he didn't go out in style!

1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,You can tell he's done a lot of planks.
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,"He may deserve this for his cooking, but you can't say that he doesn't have panache."
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,"Forward dive with a full maroon. Difficulty: 4.8...scores: 9.0, 8.5,9.0."
1551,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,559,Looks like it leaked that Trump is replacing me.
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,I still don't think he'll survive to the next round.
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,That should be a hanging offense.
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,"I say good riddance! Ever since we let him on board, he's been nothing but an albatross for us!"
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,I didn't expect Roger to be quite so jolly.
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,That thar's nothin' next to what I could do afore losin' this 'ere leg o' mine.

1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,He was a loyal pirate; I never thought he'd jump ship.
1551,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,559,I think we'd better move the fulcrum ahead for the next one Captain.
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,Talk about lemonade from lemons.

1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,"His form is good, but he can't say 'Arrghh' to save his life."
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,"Let's let him live, thats a 9.85"
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,"Nice form, but I still prefer the Four-Man Keel Haul event."
1551,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,559,"Damn, he had my cellphone."
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,It was this or another Senate hearing.
1551,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,559,"All I said was, there's no such thing as a pretty canon ball. And he said he'd prove me wrong."
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,A short walk followed by a beautiful spring dive off a relatively short plank.
1551,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,559,That one's a 10 for sure mateys.

1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,"No, it's not the same, but at least he went for something with a high degree of difficulty."
1551,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,559,He's always gotta be a show-off!

1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I'm starting to regret our affiliation with Disney.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,We're gonna miss him on the dive team.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,It was either that or synchronized swimming
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I was hoping for a little less exuberance.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Talk about making the best of a bad situation...
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"He could've done a cannonball, but nooo........"
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Going for gold.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Now that's a swan song.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Wait, weren't we supposed to bind his hands?"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Still trying to capture the gold!
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,"9, 8.5, 9.5"
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,He said he wanted out before Trump took over.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Why is he leaving a trail?
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"I said, ""Swan SONG!"""
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Somebody's been doping
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"He said ""See if you can Trump this."""
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Finley has taken'walking the plank' to new heights
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,We really need better anti-doping tests.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"I said Plank, not Springboard!"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Aye mate, he'll lose points for that!"
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,wouldn't you know he would prance the plank!
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,A class act till the end.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,You are taking the fun out of this!
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,He insisted on making waves.
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,"If I told you once, I told you twice never to Shanghai anyone from the Olympic diving team."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Aye, ye jumped the shark."
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,"Technically, he did walk it first."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Was that three and a half twists.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,No need to showboat!
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,He always had a flair for the theatrical.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,He's no chicken of the sea!
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"See what I'm talking about? Can't follow a simple instruction...I said ""WALK the plank"""
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,He never did follow orders.
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Making the best of a bad situation...
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"Arrrrrrrrrr, the judges reluctantly have to give him straight 10's!"
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,"A ten, Aye"
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Arrr. He does be a drama queen.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Nice touch. Swan Dive for Swan Song.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Silly Captain Hook, did you forget that I can fly?"
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,He's going out with such grace. I give him a 10.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"I'm drawin' a plank, mates."
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,He's always had more style than the rest of us.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Is he entered in keel hauling?
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Why won't he fall?
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"""He saw it on Pinterest""."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Alright, this is the last time we try to plunder gold from the Olympic Village!"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Well, at least he's going out in style!"
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I was kind of hoping for a jackknife.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Don't be fooled. He was the one behind all the leaks.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"He was always jolly, Roger."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,This wasn't what I meant when I said we needed more cannonballs.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Get me whatever he's been drinking
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I said no more Esther Williams movies.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Should've keelhauled him.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,I hate youtube.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Mutiny should be made an Olympic sport.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"Arr, he's good but I still prefer the cannonball."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,He swore he couldn't swim.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,He always has to make an entrance.
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Did anyone tell Fred we're beached?
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I hate spunk!
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,9.5 at least or we leave him out there - that's Pirate Law
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Well, you didn't have to enjoy yourself."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,A show-off to the end.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Divin' fer the gold, be he?"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Always goin' fer th' gold. A true scurvy pirate to th' end.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Call him Fishmeal!
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"Honestly, I was expectin' a cannonball."
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,If he does four summersaults I want him back.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"I told you the plank, not the board!"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Aye maties, it'll be gold for sure at this years Pirate Olympics!"
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Form follows function, mateys."
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,He's been perfecting the mutinous diving position.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"""I give that a perfect 10""!"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Yarrr...I'd give 'em a 6 for his approach...and a 9.5 in execution
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"I SAID...WALK! the Plank, Not.. MOCK the PLANK!"
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"As the saying goes, ""Rum before beer, never fear."""
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Arrr....but will he rip the entry?
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"He evidently missed the ‘Land, ho!’ announcement."
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,"With no leg irons, I'd only give it a 5.5."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,April Fools
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Looks like a perfect 10.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,I hate coastal elites!
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,I'd say the word for it is aplomb.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,The effort was there but the execution was lacking.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,I was kind of expecting a cannonball
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,He falls to his death with the greatest of ease.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"The water is deep enough for it, I suppose."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Remember to leave this out of the obituary.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,That's how I lost my leg.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,What he lacks in loyalty he does compensate with his exuberance.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Positive psychology has just gone too far.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,He's making the best of it.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,bloody show off to the very end !!!
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,I don't think he had the slightest idea of what jumping off the plank meant.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"As a kindness, we’ll tell his widow that he finished with a rip entry."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"Arrrrgh, mateys, depending on the splash, that's definitely a 9.8."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Notice how his feet are together. It's a 10 so far.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,There was a lack of congruence between his norms and values and ours.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I'd give him a 9; his arms are too high.
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,"Aye, it's a diver's life for him."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Maybe he actually is who he said he was
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Does he know the Olympic Diving competition isn't for 200 years?
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"Bosun, they're not taking this seriously."
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Free at last.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Mateys, we always makes time for a little Arrrgh N Arrrgh!"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Aye Matey, that scallywag Captain Louganis is on his way to Davy Jones' Locker."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"I give him a 9.5 so far, let's see if he nails the landing."
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Bloody perfect form.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Avast ye scallywags, that's the last leaker. Now let's plug the holes so the three of us can make this ship great again?"
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Well, well. I guess that was Jack Sparrow."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,I think we can contend successfully in the men's springboard competition. Now who do we have for the women's?
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,If there was another round he'd be a contender.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"No one likes a show-off, Ted."
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Let’s get back to lethal injection.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Great form – a 9.8 for execution.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I knew it was always about him.
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,I knew he was gay.
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"I told yer it were Cap'n Swan, not Cap'n Sparrow!"
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Shiver me timbers! I give him a 10 for effort, a -1 for survival."
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Performance arrrt, me matey."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,We're just not getting through to him.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,What would you do for a Klondike Bar?
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,You told him he only gets one try!
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,He always had a flair for exits
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Aye...that's making the best of a bad situation.
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,His execution is a perfect 10!
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,8 - 10 - 6
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,I think he knows what he's doing .
1777,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Enjoy it while it lasts.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,That guy just reeks positivity!
1777,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Now there's a man with an attitude
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Well if you gotta go, go with style!"
1777,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"When you said we were going to a dive bar, this wasn't what I had in mind."
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,He must have heard 'work' the plank.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Apparently the standing desk wasn't enough to keep him around.
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Smart-ass!
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,He always looks on the bright side of life!
1777,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Now we know who's from Penzance.

2010,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,559,You're right. A renegade pirate who happens to be an Olympic diver really does kinda jump the shark
2010,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,559,He stole the show.
2010,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,559,Doesn't qualify.

2010,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,559,I didn't even know he could swim.
2010,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,559,He thinks he's a contestant on Pirate's Got Talent.

2010,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,559,I told him we'd just appointed him National Security Advisor.

2010,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,559,Very bad attitude.
2010,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,559,That's what I'd call a happy meal.
2010,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,559,I knew we should have kept him for the inter-ship talent show.

2010,1,7,41,49,1.183673469387755,0.06303997616615865,559,"Aargh mateys, this is the last ""two week fun filled"" cruise ship we pillage."
2010,0,9,40,49,1.183673469387755,0.05589005688828228,559,"Aargh, not bad. But 'tis the keelhauling competition that is the make or break."
2010,2,5,42,49,1.183673469387755,0.069457747811776,559,I could do that.
2010,0,9,40,49,1.183673469387755,0.05589005688828228,559,I still bet he can't swim.

2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,It must be Spring time.
2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,That's one way to do it.
2972,0,6,39,45,1.1333333333333333,0.05124707431905384,559,"Yeah, but for a pirate, Greg does a lousy ""cannonball""."

2972,0,6,39,45,1.1333333333333333,0.05124707431905384,559,I’m just saying this park put pirate authenticity first when I started working here in the early 1990s.
2972,0,6,39,45,1.1333333333333333,0.05124707431905384,559,He says his name is Amadaos Wallenda.
2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,I'd ask him to join our diving team if those waters weren't shark infested.
2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,"I give it a 10, but who cares."

2972,0,6,39,45,1.1333333333333333,0.05124707431905384,559,All I said is I thought the bouillabaisse could use a little salt
2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,I give it 1.8 for Degree of Difficulty.

2972,0,6,39,45,1.1333333333333333,0.05124707431905384,559,I'll give him a piece of eight out of ten.
2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,He's got beautiful form. It's a shame the scurvy dog has to die.
2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,I like the fact that he is proactive.
2972,1,4,40,45,1.1333333333333333,0.06030226891555274,559,"I said walk the plank, not jump into the ocean like a salty sea swan! These prisoners take too many liberties nowadays. I gotta get out of this pirate business. The planks just not what it used to be."

3316,0,5,38,43,1.1162790697674418,0.04946336973228635,559,"With a bottle of rum, I'd give it a nine point yo-ho-ho."
3316,1,3,39,43,1.1162790697674418,0.059615808787130756,559,He used to do ballet.

3439,1,3,40,44,1.1136363636363635,0.05830506897872825,559,We're we supposed to teach him to swim before or after he jumped in?

3439,1,3,40,44,1.1136363636363635,0.05830506897872825,559,I'd say it's a 9.5.
3439,0,5,39,44,1.1136363636363635,0.048398332783092544,559,We should have just given him 100 lashes
