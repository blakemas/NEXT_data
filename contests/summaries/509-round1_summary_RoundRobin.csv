7384,1,3,1,1,5,2.4,0.39999999999999997,509,It's true what they say--you can't go home again.
7765,1,3,1,1,5,2.4,0.39999999999999997,509,Great. I'm gonna die a virgin.
7040,3,1,3,0,4,2.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Have you considered the many benefits of a vegan diet?
660,4,2,3,1,6,2.1666666666666665,0.30731814857642953,509,We're smoked.
309,4,3,1,2,6,2.1666666666666665,0.40138648595974313,509,Make yourself look big.
1916,4,1,5,0,6,2.1666666666666665,0.18257418583505536,509,This is the last time I follow my instincts.
137,7,2,2,2,6,2.0,0.3651483716701107,509,I think we should adopt.
1953,7,1,4,1,6,2.0,0.2581988897471611,509,As if this swimming upstream thing wasn't hard enough.
174,7,1,4,1,6,2.0,0.2581988897471611,509,Can't a couple have a little privacy?
274,7,2,1,2,5,2.0,0.4472135954999579,509,"Damn, I'm still a virgin."
7855,7,1,3,1,5,2.0,0.31622776601683794,509,Please! I have a wife and two thousand kids!
221,7,1,4,1,6,2.0,0.2581988897471611,509,We should have gotten a room.
3404,7,2,2,2,6,2.0,0.3651483716701107,509,"I thought it was spawn, then die."
4133,7,3,0,3,6,2.0,0.4472135954999579,509,Apparently I misunderstood when the directions said 'Bear right at falls.'
5102,7,2,2,2,6,2.0,0.3651483716701107,509,Salmon lives matter
496,7,2,2,2,6,2.0,0.3651483716701107,509,"You wouldn't eat a talking fish, would you?"
6704,7,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,509,You're in my way!
7513,7,2,1,2,5,2.0,0.4472135954999579,509,Two for dinner?
6105,7,1,4,1,6,2.0,0.2581988897471611,509,Come on! We're on our honeymoon.
39,7,1,4,1,6,2.0,0.2581988897471611,509,Instinct is overrated.
7693,7,2,1,2,5,2.0,0.4472135954999579,509,Sometimes I wonder if it's worth the effort.
552,7,1,4,1,6,2.0,0.2581988897471611,509,Let's be the ones that got away.
7770,7,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,509,I can never remember whether to play dead or make lots of noise.
4819,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,But Google Maps said bear to the right!
5205,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,This is the last time I go spawning with you.
934,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,"Okay, now I'm feeling endangered."
3930,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,I wish I was farm-raised.
5924,24,0,5,1,6,1.8333333333333333,0.18257418583505536,509,That's what we get for trusting our instincts.
362,24,0,5,1,6,1.8333333333333333,0.18257418583505536,509,"Sure...we'll just swim upstream, you said. We'll meet some hot chicks, you said."
2417,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,Doesn't look like the catch and release type
2004,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,Yep...a bus load of tourists...all carrying Happy Meals.
1131,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,It's always darkest before the spawn.
5881,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,Genetically modified! Genetically modified!
4842,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,"I told you we should've stayed on the farm, but NOOOOOO!"
599,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,Can't you just follow us on Facebook?
5324,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,I guess you really can't go home again.
83,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,How do you feel about catch-and-release?
3662,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,I'm obliged to warn you that consuming raw or undercooked fish may increase your risk of foodborne illness
4309,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,Whoops... I think I just spawned myself
2396,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,"Watch out, I have salmonella!"
5008,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,"Please -- I have a wife and 5,000 kids!"
1709,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,I'm suddenly not in the mood anymore.
4418,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,I always hoped I’d wind up on a bagel.
2499,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,If you can wait a minute there's a 15-pounder just behind me.
1317,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,To hell with instinct! I'm turning around!
1697,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,Try to look bigger than you really are.
232,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,One false move and you'll find out why they call us sockeyes!
6167,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,Looks like a Kodiak moment
1248,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,Think long-term. We're trying to multiply.
3886,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,Another Kodiak moment!
4073,24,2,1,3,6,1.8333333333333333,0.40138648595974313,509,This could be the last time I use Google Maps.
4318,24,0,5,1,6,1.8333333333333333,0.18257418583505536,509,I believe we have the right of way.
3123,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,We are so done with ecotourism.
1832,24,0,5,1,6,1.8333333333333333,0.18257418583505536,509,Relax! I read somewhere they mostly eat porridge.
442,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,"I know you think I look like salmon, but I identify as perch."
2510,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,"On second thought, maybe we should have just spawned at home."
1250,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,"Next year, let's just go with the flow."
824,24,1,3,2,6,1.8333333333333333,0.30731814857642953,509,Talk about a mood-killer.
6570,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,We'll get home safe. It's a Chicago cub.
6625,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,Instinct's a bitch.
6754,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,"I guess this time, the bear eats me."
6596,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,I'm out of season.
1011,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,Don't believe all you hear about the benefits of eating salmon.
7655,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,So much for the honeymoon.
5475,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,"Remind me, why is it that we start at the bottom of the stream?"
6682,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,Coming home is always a mistake.
7084,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,"Mercury, high levels of mercury."
7328,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,"Abort, abort, abort!"
980,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,"Now, throw him the steak!"
3328,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,Would it change things if we told you we're from Flint?
6980,59,0,4,1,5,1.8,0.22360679774997896,509,We're more endangered than you.
4922,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,My GPS did not tell me about this.
5539,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,The neighborhood sure seemed friendlier when we were kids.
1353,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,Maybe we should go with the flow.
7736,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,"Never mind the woods, what do bears do in the streams?"
6941,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,"But then again, who needs kids?"
7756,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,"What, you can't skip one snack to allow a mind-blowing mystery of nature to occur?"
6953,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,NO FISH WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS CARTOON
6945,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,You really do take the fun out of it.
7565,59,1,2,2,5,1.8,0.37416573867739417,509,For this I schlepped upstream?
6987,59,2,0,3,5,1.8,0.48989794855663565,509,This bear market is going to be the death of me
6627,82,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,509,"uh, uh, uh...you gave us up for Lent"
6965,82,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,509,Bear right past the rapids.
6419,82,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,509,There they stood...eye to sockeye.
6649,82,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,509,"It's a Black Bear, Kyle. Just flap your fins, look it in the eye, and scream."
7791,82,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,509,I cannot believe I'm gonna die a virgin.
6769,82,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,509,That's it--I'm adopting.
4952,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Tell him you're pregnant.
2587,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Still think the mountains are more romantic than the beach?
406,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Now I know how Sisyphus felt
191,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Well...this is awkward.
227,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I can see an argument for going with the flow
3197,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,May I recommend the trout?
4925,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I thought the GPS said bear left.
4068,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I told you we should've stopped for directions
2404,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,"Well, this explains why Dave never returned our calls."
1412,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"Honey, you wanted the exciting, romantic get-away."
2389,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Don't let anyone ever tell you that spawning is safe sex.
3327,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Pretty good, and you?"
361,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,You know you don't have to do this...
4787,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Do Grizzlies observe Lent?
2447,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"Please, think of the children!"
4025,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Is this hell or high water?.
391,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,See Honey? This is why I didn't want to honeymoon upriver.
5630,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"On second thought, maybe I can live a fulfilled life without children of my own."
3337,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Really!?
5625,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,You go ahead - I suddenly don't feel like spawning anymore.
6048,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Uh-oh, looks like they fish in the woods too."
2495,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I told you not to post our location on Facebook!
4913,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,You can't always trust your instincts!
6060,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"You know, I think spawning is really overrated!"
3335,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times......"
2319,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I'm thinking there are times we have to say no to our first instinct.
2176,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Yes! I knew that this Bear Market would kill me!
429,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"Let's talk, one endangered species to another"
3907,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Into the valley of death swam the 600.
3653,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,1000 Babies on Board.
1889,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,"No, I haven't seen 'The Revenant'. Why do you ask?"
1886,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Maybe we should adopt.
5379,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,You'd think natural selection would have fixed this by now.
3905,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"But if you let me through, you can eat my offspring for years to come."
4536,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Bon appétit!
3902,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,"Oops,I think we're up #*##**!! creek."
4529,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"If you wait just twenty minutes, you could have caviar instead."
4398,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Salmon. It's what's for dinner.
4399,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I brought an appetizer.
1814,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Have you seen my wife?
758,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,I thought you guys just ate porridge.
1919,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,He wants us to stay for dinner.
1591,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,You were right. We should've gone back to your place.
3731,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,So much for safe sex.
776,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,You go first.
3875,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Can't you see that you're hopelessly outnumbered?
1745,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,How badly do you want children?
803,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I knew I should have learned how to do the back stroke.
1616,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Quick, bear left!"
5435,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"'Swim upstream,' they said. 'There will be plenty of women,' they said."
5720,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,"I'm not just a piece of meat, you know."
842,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Behind you — Minnesota dentist.
3812,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Whoa! You're not hibernating. Climate change is real.
847,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I tested high in mercury!
4441,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"Don't worry, Eric. He's probably more scared of us than we are of him."
856,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Why did the water get warmer all of a sudden?
4407,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,What good is lox? It's not like you'll find a good bagel in Montana!
5653,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Don't do it - I'm from Flint.
4578,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,I don't think he cares that we're a protected species.
1966,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I trust you've got a permit?
1436,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Fake left, On THREE."
4770,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,The guys downstream are organic
3411,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Don't worry. I hear lethal bear attacks are very rare.
450,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I get the feeling we all won't be 'streaming live' anymore.
456,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I knew I shouldn't have tweeted we were coming home.
3977,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,You're building a what? And you want us to pay for it?
4742,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I should warn you that I'm from Flint.
5287,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Don't eat us! We're from Flint!
1461,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,What do you mean YOU'RE an endangered species!
4718,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,The really tasty fish are behind us.
516,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Now might be a good time to just go with the flow.
532,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"Yes, we're a good fat, but nuts and berries are much better for you."
4698,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I don't have to swim the fastest. I just have to swim faster than you...Oh shit
4592,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Shouldn't you be preventing forest fires somewhere?
985,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"On second thought, I have a headache."
1478,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Congratulations, you've been naturally selected."
3511,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,"Ok, now I get it. BEAR LEFT, at the next falls."
982,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Sometimes it's just better to go with the flow!
3522,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Sometimes I really hate my instincts.
4669,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,I guess it's true. You can't go home again.
4662,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Maybe next time you'll listen when I say we should stop and ask for directions.
3946,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Party of two?
5556,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,It turns out it really is the journey; not the destination.
1513,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I knew there was a catch.
2007,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,And mom said it wouldn't kill me to have kids.
2000,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"It's a grizzly Nedd, make yourself look big!"
4366,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,We escaped from the hatchery for this?
1974,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,And I thought getting up here was the hard part.
2125,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I knew one day I would regret swimming upstream
177,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,That'll be two for dinner.
2063,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Is this the way to the promised land?
6169,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Hi there! Two for dinner?
6205,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Damn! Oh well. Still beats the Flint River.
6285,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Excuse me, we're on our honeymoon."
1287,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I'm totally giving this spawning site one star on Yelp.
5560,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Nope. Farm-raised. Sorry.
6373,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,Watch me kick this bear's ass.
5011,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,Here's the plan: You distract him while I swim by.
3068,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Here's a thought. Let's just spawn downstream this year.
3105,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Fake left, go right!"
91,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Just spare me the circle of life rationalizations, OK?"
4151,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Roe, roe, roe your b. . . uh oh!"
2673,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Bear left, I mean bear right!"
1172,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,The moment Sam forgot all about spawning.
1222,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"Dude, come on. I'm trying to get laid here."
143,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,"Sir, afraid I must ask to see your fishing license."
173,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,I knew my sex drive was going to kill me one day.
6177,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,"See, this is why I don't go home for the holidays."
4173,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I thought this was supposed to be safe sex.
2962,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"Don't worry, he prefers farm raised."
4172,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,I've suddenly lost the urge to spawn.
2901,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Starting to wish I was born gay.
1199,88,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,509,Not now. Catch us on the way back.
6352,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,I will never trust Google Maps again.
1181,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,Oh Oh. Coitus interruptus.
3035,88,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,509,*Consuming raw or undercooked seafood may increase your risk of foodborne illness.
3043,88,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,509,"On second thought, downstream seems like a great option."
6871,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Move over bear. No one is going to stand in the way of me and my reproductive rights.
7614,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,"Wait for my mother-in-law, she's twice my size!"
7615,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,"Hey, Sal, did you remember to bring the pepper spray?"
7571,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Look! It's the guy from The Revenant!
7805,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,This is not the welcome home I was expecting.
7843,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,"Didn’t expect us to be swimming backwards downstream, did you?"
7510,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Watch out! I'm genetically modified.
921,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,So this is what it means to be an endangered species!
6711,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,...In twenty meters bear right ahead...
7361,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Who says we have to swim upstream to lay our eggs?
7824,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,And berries have lots more antioxidants too!
2133,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Act nonchalant.
6585,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"All things considered, wouldn't you rather be hibernating?"
3112,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Forget it, Sally. Sex is overrated."
7820,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Buzz off Smokey, we are piranhas!"
4269,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,"On second thought, let's go with the flow."
5654,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Just so you know, we're neither vegan nor locally sourced."
7796,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Those farm-raised snoots don't know how easy they have it.
7381,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,A bear a salmon and a trout walk into a bar...
6798,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,"Don't look now, but there is a man behind you with a rifle."
7798,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Do you stream all your meals live?
6770,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,They never covered this in sex ed.
6819,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"If this is a Friday in Lent and this guy's Catholic, we've got a problem!"
6312,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"I told you we should go with the flow, but Nooooo!"
6313,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,I don't need to swim faster than the bear--I just need to swim slower than you!
7392,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,I knew that was too easy.
7705,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,This concludes our live stream
3252,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,I'm beginning to think this spawning thing is overrated.
6519,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Let's just adopt.
5686,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,There are plenty of fish in the sea...I swear!
6750,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Go for the guy in the back! He's organic.
6835,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Don't eat me! I was raised in Flint.
6837,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Oh yea? Why don't you come down here and say that?
2679,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Okay, I'm distracting him. Now what?"
7602,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,I hate when this happens.
6744,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,So much for my romantic finale!!
7606,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Excuse me Sir, do you have a moment to talk about Jesus Christ, our Lord and savior?"
6740,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,I don't suppose I could interest you in a nice mercury-free trout?
71,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Spawn of a bitch!
6844,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Aim for the nostrils!
5491,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Shouldn't you be on Wall Street?
6928,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Funny, Google maps didn't mention this."
5782,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Think you can take me? I'll spawn on your grave tough guy.
6435,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Damn you GPS!
7851,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,I admire your ability to just go with the flow.
6909,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Tons of bones!
6600,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,"Look left, fake right"
7352,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,This spawning thing better be good
7349,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,I’m open to negotiation.
6689,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,I suggest now might be an appropriate time to spawn.
7848,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,I knew I smelled feet.
7438,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Why, yes, I am satisfied with my long-distance carrier."
6679,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Poison fish coming through! Poison fish!!
6452,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Excuse me. Is this the end of the line?
7334,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,I don't think he is into catch and release.
7462,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Try the venison.
7417,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,'I knew you'd be back'
3384,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,They're serious about their borders up here!
4720,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,I'm beginning to have second thoughts about this whole mating thing.
6441,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Go Cubs!
7852,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,'Spawn of the Dead' ... now I get it.
7347,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,"I don't need to out-swim the bear, Sal. I just need to out-swim you."
6902,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,"Heads I win, tales you lose."
7450,205,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,509,Whoa! Spawnus interruptis!
3207,205,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,509,Uber. I told you to order an Uber.
2066,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Maybe you're right that we can't go home again.
2079,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Oh, so that's what he meant by bear left."
4325,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Is this what they mean by up a creek without a paddle?
3429,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I should've become a monkfish.
5901,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Is keeping our species alive so damned important?
463,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I hate this commute.
2252,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Spawnicus Interruptus!
970,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,And I was proud of being upwardly mobile......
1223,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Did you forget that salmon is loaded with mercury?
67,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I told you we should have spawned before we left.
3578,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,You stand out here like a fish out of water!
451,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Seriously, yellowfin tuna is the new salmon."
2013,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,You'd think my horoscope would've mentioned this.
4768,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Darling, you go ahead. I'll be right behind you."
621,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you we should have taken the tunnel!
2803,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Recalculate route!
3568,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Jeepers . . . like this isn't hard enough already.
614,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"We just had to keep going to find some privacy, huh?"
4640,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,We shouldn't have signed with the reality show.
63,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,We've got to stop meeting like this!
4648,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"You know we are an endangered species, right?"
2273,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,All this for one lousy lay?
2269,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Hey man, it's OK. I was only going to live for another two days anyway."
2262,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,We're on track - it said 'Bear left at falls'.
6646,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,Avoid us! We just escaped from the farm!
2759,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Omega-3's aren't as good for you as everyone thinks!
3546,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Maybe next time you will stop and ask for directions
3428,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Why didn't I just go with the flow?
6654,270,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,509,This wild salmon life is for the birds.
1241,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Please don't! I've got a husband and 2500 little ones.
3436,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Full disclosure: we're from Flint.
4332,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I just *hate* these school trips.
1475,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The GPS did say bear left at the falls
5930,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,We'll catch you on our way back.
2155,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"I jump in his mouth, you die upstream."
4333,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The big fat fish are all behind us.
2156,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Hi, I'm in your area discussing the Bible with your neighbors."
2162,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I wouldn't eat me...I just swam in from Flint MI.
6418,270,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,509,"Yes, we want to enter your territory to have our babies, but we're not from Mexico..."
2165,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"'You're into catch-and-release, right'?"
1239,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"I told you, we should have just gone with the flow."
3002,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Have you tried tuna?
2171,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Your breath smells like Doug.
1464,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Catch me on the way back. I won't care.
6700,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,"They looked like Bear Claws in the water, but that ain't no pastry!"
5532,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Not now. I'm spawning.
2146,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Wouldn't you prefer a more mainstream salmon?
2083,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,What are the chances he's a vegan?
541,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Actually, we're anchovies."
2200,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Well, that kills the mood."
4326,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I assume your familiar with the FDA’s recent advisory on mercury in seafood?
479,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"You know, on second thought, children are overrated."
3961,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm Princess Salmonella.
2091,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"So, what was it like working with DiCaprio?"
3975,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Hey Jerry, I bet this guy knows a great place to stop for lunch."
568,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Sustainable for who?
5909,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Can you give me a break, I only get some once a year"
4212,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Two's company. It looks like three's probably fatal.
5918,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Teach the kids how to swim downstream!
6674,270,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,509,Don't bother- my omega 3s are low today
3455,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I see what you mean about sex being overrated.
4731,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,You again!
93,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I loved you in The Revenant!
2132,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"You do realize, we are full of toxins?"
4211,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Look into my eyes and breathe. You're feeling very sleepy.
3500,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Hey buddy, it's a one-way stream!"
6706,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,"Yeah. Great shortcut, Floyd."
2656,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Perfect! Now we won't have to visit your parents
5460,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I totally misunderstood when you told me 'bear left'
3880,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I just lost my sex drive
1773,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"That's awe in his eyes, right?"
780,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Just act casual...
779,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Boy, you sure know how to ruin a hot date!"
21,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Ok, ok, you win. Downstream it is!"
22,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I've never heard of National Geographic. Why do you ask?
5100,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,What if I teach you to fish instead?
4508,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Like swimming upstream isn't bad enough?!
772,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Bear to the left... I mean bear to the right!
5101,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Some honeymoon.
1593,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Just passing through, thank you."
1787,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,'Let's hope that he's a vegan'.
3715,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,If you can wait another week I'll get bigger.
5073,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,You knew my parents?
1204,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Pescatarian diets are just so passé.
754,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,You have to finish your blueberries first...
6286,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Do you mind? We're on our honeymoon.
3710,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Apparently, what goes up doesn't necessarily come down!"
2928,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Bear to your LEFT!
1819,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,We thought you were WAY better than Leo.
4396,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Don't be scared, I'm a vegan."
1830,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,And I thought the guys in the barrel had it bad.
31,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,You're sure it's not Berenstein?
4499,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,This next stretch looks like a real bear
4497,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"A guy finally says, 'I'm just going to take a leap of faith,' and..."
790,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,The things we do just to get laid.
1754,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"I warned you, going against the current would be dangerous."
3838,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,My life cycle just flashed before my eyes....
1655,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"On second thought, spawning's overrated."
866,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Haven't you heard? The EPA says mercury levels in salmon are at an all time high.
843,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Eat more chicken.
4426,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Yes, I am farm raised, genetically modified."
5421,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,We really need to change are spawning ritual!
837,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Spawning is the last item on our bucket list.
2864,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Don't you know you can't go home again?
10,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Nobody said a word about this at the hatchery.
3791,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Relax we're safe, he doesn't have a fishing pole."
3788,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,It'll be OK. I've seen this guy before - he can't catch.
3893,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I told you we should have stopped to ask for directions.
6247,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,We're fully booked and not seating anybody without a reservation.
1722,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The Alaskan Migrants Crisis
4183,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Quick...someone is at your house eating your porridge right now!!
7472,270,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,509,"'OK, you were right - maybe a fish does need a bicycle'"
16,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"I swear, you and your 'live streaming' will be the death of me."
880,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Aren't you supposed to be on Wall Street?
5766,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,This is why I love Fire Island.
1733,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,A little privacy? We're spawning.
1619,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"I'm not Wanda, she's Wanda."
3866,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Told you we should've gotten off at the last exit!
799,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I say we spawn in Miami.
1746,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,You know you shouldn't overeat just before hibernating.
6282,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"I know I don't look it, but I'm farm raised."
4526,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,The berries look really good this year.
3898,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Barbara immediately regretted not forcing Bob to look up the directions beforehand.
6883,270,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,509,"Hello, have you met my wife, Tasty?"
5451,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"I don't have to be faster than you, I just have to be faster than him."
2824,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I’m too old for these games.
5856,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,It's called 'menage à trout.'
5055,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I am beginning to think this is more work than it is worth.
671,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Quick, lay your eggs"
2951,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"It's only fair to tell you, I swam all the way from Flint."
4582,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"I'm just saying we should discuss it. Lots of couples are very, very happy without having kids."
665,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Don't worry. This generation doesn't know how to fish, they just wait for someone to give them one."
103,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Alas,the grizzly end."
5862,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Show me your fishing license, please."
2821,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Like its not hard enough swimming upstream...
6224,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Sorry honey. Suddenly, I'm no longer in the mood."
5354,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Next time let's just go to a motel.
4595,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I think this could interrupt our sex lives
944,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I thought you said bare left!
4599,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Shouldn't you be hibernating?
2954,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Maybe next time we should just go to my place.
1973,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Are you sure there's no room for compromise?
5344,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,How lucky! A local...we can ask for directions.
1171,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Where am I going? I have a hot date. You?
5867,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Now you see why we Pisces get so damned depressed.
4612,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Spoiler alert! I'm farm raised.
2973,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The one time I go upstream!
4624,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Do you mind? You're kind of ruining the moment.
658,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The Farmer's Almanac said you would still be hibernating!
2974,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I thought we lost this guy at the last waterfall!
5450,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I told you we should have just adopted.
3912,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm dangerously full of mercury.
5442,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Your shoelace is untied.
1573,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,This hardly feels sporting.
7025,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,Are you sure he is a Vegan?
5549,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Thanks a lot, Siri."
1565,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I told you before: it's over!
1863,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"I don't have to out-swim the bear, Jerry... I only have to out-swim you."
1866,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Watch it big guy, they don't call me sockeye for nothing."
1868,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Trust us! There's no such thing of free level of mercury.
1869,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,So this is the downside to swimming upstream.
2838,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The hell with it. Let's spawn downstream.
4543,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Ask Yourself, What Would Smokey Do?"
3626,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"God, I hate Alaska."
4188,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"'Let's swim upstream for a change,' you said. 'It'll be fun,' you said!"
41,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Behind you!
1893,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,So do you still think the journey is more important than the destination?
1897,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,We aren't the fish you are looking for.
6225,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Just so you know, I'm not kosher."
5375,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Uh-oh, this should have been the stream not taken."
1555,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"No, I do not have a few minutes to talk about preventing forest fires."
1907,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Haven't you heard? Honey is the new fish.
5374,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,We should have chosen abstinence.
929,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I should have stayed on the farm.
5063,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Uh-oh! So much for live streaming...
5839,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,did you remember to buy the trip insurance?
4387,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I envy Atlantic salmon.
1960,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Don't eat me I have salmonella.
4710,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Yes it is where salmonella comes from.
6457,270,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,509,Death doesn't discriminate and neither does lunch.
124,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"I swear, there's better eats comin'."
6098,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I think that perhaps we should jut go with the flow.
312,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Two thousand miles uphill for this?
1043,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I sure hope this county practices a catch and release policy
2625,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Just in time for Lent.
167,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,A bear?? This is SO going on Trip Advisor!
313,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Just making my way back from the Mercury pool.
4307,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Keep swimming, Sheila, and find someone else to love."
1397,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,He's tastier!
226,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,What's DiCaprio like on set?
2353,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,We need a new annual tradition.
2352,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I'm going to give him the most ferocious look that I can.
4869,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you the GPS said 'bear left'
3344,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Not tonight honey I'm going to have a headache.
4231,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I have herpes.
316,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,We need to update our GPS.
1139,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Damn my instincts!
1285,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"We just HAD to go out on Valentine's Day, didn't we Gail?"
2278,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The traffic report said it was clear!
271,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Hi! Don't just stand there, a little help wouldn't kill ya."
6103,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"F.Y.I., my buddy here is mercury-free."
4805,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I need to see some ID
4004,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Spawning is overrated! let's turn back.
187,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Catch and release is in effect.
3357,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I told you we should have practiced safe sex!
6376,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,This is why I never went back to the old neighborhood.
7332,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,Have you considered the benefits of vegetarianism?
398,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Up stream all day and then it's got to end in a bear market.
5518,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"For the umpteenth time, why are you so afraid to ask for directions?!?!?"
3366,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Haven't you heard that mercury level in salmon is at a dangerously high level?
1373,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Play dead, it worked for DiCaprio."
377,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Upstream, you said. They'll never see it coming, you said"
4983,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I should've upgraded my GPS.
2382,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Don't even bother, buddy. We're GMO."
1069,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Excuse me, but I believe we have the right of way."
1316,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,'Just when you think it can't get any worse'.
1133,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you we should've slept in.
6106,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,I don't have to swim faster than the bear - I just have to swim slower than you.
3329,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Something tells me that my 5,000 eggs are NOT going to make it to market..."
356,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,This is what humans refer to as an existential dilemma.
1305,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,You should talk to your doctor about mercury.
4014,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,You think he cares you are a GMO?
5211,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,We really should learn to swim downstream.
3333,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Maybe we should think about not having kids.
370,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,My little friend here says you're too old and slow to catch him.
136,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Have you read about Mercury Levels?
2581,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Dude, this is the last time I let you book online."
5150,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Bear! How are you man? I haven't seen you since you were a cub.
4822,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Fish are friends, not food."
5197,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Sometimes I wish I was farm raised.
4279,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Let's get away from the farm and have some adventures you said.
7326,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,"(optional box at top of cartoon: 'The brief reincarnation of the Salmon Brothers') 'Herbert, I thought you said Stern Bears went belly up.'"
304,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Remember when I said you just need to be faster than the other guy? Never mind.
5624,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Wait, my mercury level is very high!"
172,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Why does there always seem to be something standing between me and my dreams?
288,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Don't do it! You have so much to live for!
148,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Really, the one night she doesn't have a headache."
6041,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Would it make a difference if I said I just swam in from Flint?
220,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Why don't you go eat Leonardo DiCaprio.
7126,270,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,509,Consuming raw or undercooked fish or seafood may increase your risk of foodborne illness.
4834,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"There are other fish in the sea, you know."
5498,270,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Didn't you hear? We are a protected species.
2508,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Maybe we should consider adopting.
132,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,What I wouldn't give for Air brakes.
253,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,The gypsy was right!
6069,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Pardon me.
2441,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,"Don't over think this, but your breath is terrible."
2569,270,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,509,Frank. Quick. Play dead.

7697,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,We're escapees from a salmon farm; we're loaded with chemicals and antibiotics.
1231,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,Funny running into you here
7459,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,But the directions said bear left.

7813,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,Something about this brings to mind Roe versus Wade.
6648,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,"Damn, and we just escaped from the salmon farm."

7207,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,Full disclosure. We're loaded with PCBs.

6602,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,"Bob, is this what they mean by coitus interruptus in upstreamis?"
7089,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,"Hey, man, I'm an endangered species obeying this compelling urge to swim upstream, fertilize eggs, then die . What's your gig?"
7077,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,"We can swim upstream, we just don't believe you're a fertility coach."
7696,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,Sorry for the misunderstanding. The salmon special was yesterday. Today's special is succulent seal.
2865,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,"Don't take the salmon ladder, you said. Let's be wild and free, you said."

5677,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,I knew we should have staid in Flint.
25,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,"I know it's big and dirty, but what do you think about staying in the ocean to start a family?"
7377,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,I just shat my roe.

7058,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,How about we spawn downstream this time?
6788,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,So this is your idea of rough foreplay?
7774,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,"Salmon? Nooo, we're lemmings. L-e-m-m-i-n-g-s."
7715,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,"Actually, we're tilapia. The salmon is in aisle two."
4019,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,Looks like you're getting 'fish belly'. Just sayin'.
6028,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,Every year this happens! We really should consider spawning downstream...
5037,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,. . . recalculating . . .
6542,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,You should know that I was farm-raised.
6797,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,Before we begin: farm-raised or wild?
4848,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,"It's tough, but it's faster than the L train."
6540,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,I can already tell I'm going to hate being a father.

7071,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,I'm supposed to ask - farm raised or wild caught?
7180,570,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,509,Our farm-raised counterparts are a much better deal.
7778,570,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,509,"Well don't just stand there, help me up!"

5249,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Downstream would have been a better option.
369,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,You sure our spawning grounds aren't at the base of the falls?
368,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Tell him you're tilapia.
4652,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,The big guy down stream said it's called 'Catch and Release'!
5325,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,This could be a grizzly ending.
4832,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"Uh oh... I'm guessing that the 'Bear left' back at the fork was a warning sign, not a directional suggestion!"
357,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Don't. I've already been here for three days.
4492,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Talk about a treacherous commute
4360,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Let's hope he's vegan.
958,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Must we go through this every year?
5463,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,You're mother wants you to go home.
4841,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,The guy behind me has more Omega-3.
4649,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,They never said anything about bonding with your food.
4493,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Think outside the lox.
4494,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Oh no, Sam! Looks like we found our bear-ings."
345,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,They didn't say anything about going up the food chain.
792,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Just let me get to the spawning grounds. Then I'm all yours.
791,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Bear to the right, there's a bear to the left."
5473,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Great, as if swimming up stream wasn't hard enough!"
1001,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Think of the children!
4330,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"I kept telling you Ralph, to stop and ask or directions"
5476,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,And that right there is why you should buy travel insurance.
260,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I appreciate the offer of 'having me for dinner' - but my date's waiting for me upstream.
5393,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"Yeah, bummer of an instinct"
1031,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,This may get grizzly.
767,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"No, I mean, 'a bear', literally, upstream is a bear."
255,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"This is hard enough, buddy!"
4512,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Why you should never drink and swim.
1036,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Years of fish school, down the drain!"
254,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Take the next one. He is paying it forward.
5481,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"No, for real - Dicaprio's right behind you."
633,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"Hey bear! Why don't you go fuck yourself?! Fuck you, bear!"
251,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Let me guess, you've given up on porridge and gone Paleo."
4924,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Do you have a minute to talk about the environment?
245,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Give me a minute to score with the wife and we'll both come back
765,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,THIS is the reward we get for swimming against the current?
4927,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I told you the bear tracking app wouldn't work once we crossed the Canadian border.
4928,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I said we should have just gone back to my place.
4304,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Maybe we should just go with the flow.
5180,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I knew we should have gone with the flow.
239,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"Okay, which one of you is Moe?"
236,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,So much for our being upwardly mobile!
5178,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Move before I punch you in the mouth!
1030,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I'm retracing my roots... are you my mother?
4815,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"I don't know if I'm comfortable with the question, but a Pinot Noir always pairs nicely."
4628,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I don't recommend the salmon with eggs.
5187,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,We have bad news about your cousin Polar.
4635,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"In case you didn't get the word, we're being grossly over-fished!"
299,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"My mother-in-law is fatter, and she's right behind me."
5478,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Well, this is the last time I'm going to ask you for directions!"
4634,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Why do I always pick the wrong line !
4889,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"After kids, what's the point?"
5329,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Would you consider catch and release?
5396,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Don't jump to conclusions.
5195,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Don't worry, I'm right behind you if he tries anything."
5394,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Look, Fred. They sent someone to welcome us home."
285,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"'The right to bear arms,' doesn't give you the right to use them to catch fish."
283,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Open wide!
282,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,I'm more endangered than you are
624,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"We were born here, so we ARE entitled to run."
4910,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"When you said 'bear left up ahead', you weren't exactly giving me directions, were you."
5189,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I should have just used Tinder.
5479,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Bear left. No! Right! Bear right!
1022,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,As if swimming against the current wasn't hard enough.
4319,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Mind the bones
770,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I always knew I'd meet a grizzly end.
268,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Are you looking at me? Are you? No ! Then who the hell are you looking at?

262,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I didn't say it made any sense. I said it's my biological imperative.
5452,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,I forgot my password.

500,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,School’s out forever.
4427,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,"Excuse me, do you live around here? I'm trying to find my parents' old spawning grounds: Clark and Harriet Salmon? They were eaten around 2006."
835,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,It's tough to swim upstream in a bear market!
4727,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"Pardon me, but we are terribly late for our mating. Could you please eat us on the way back."
5432,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,"OK, Bobby, it's time you started thinking for yourself. I'm going back."
4728,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,Google Maps said our route was clear!

4735,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,Sometimes the sex just isn't worth it.
831,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,I'm previously frozen.

846,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,This is what happens when you spawn before marriage.

230,748,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,509,I guess that's the 'exciting local fauna' mentioned in the brochure.
5513,748,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,509,I think now's a good time to start going with the flow!

7229,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Look into my eyes, you are getting sleeeeepy."
6903,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Are you certified organic?
6886,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Check it! Bear's eyebrows are on point today.
7042,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Sorry, I got parasites, but she's healthy."
6781,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Isn't it past your nap time?
6779,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Lotta work to 'make' dinner!
6533,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,OK ... AFTER the spawn. Deal?
6887,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Hey, get out of the way. It's tough enough without you blocking the way."
6521,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Swimming upstream is always a bear
7073,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Be careful, you don't want to end up like that guy in the movie!"
6696,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Only YOU can prevent salmon slaughter
7072,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,I'm done with the photo shoot - I'm hungry!
6120,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"It was nice chatting with you, but I really need to go lay some eggs."
7301,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Quick, hit the rewind button."
6554,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,What's a flexitarian?
6885,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Okay, tough guy, I'm back with my buddy. You want to try that again?"
6561,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Hey you! Come a little bit closer.
7227,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"' Fellas, a bit higher and the Olympic Gold is yours. Just one more practice High Jump, and we will break for lunch!"
6920,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,I told you we should have checked Google Maps!
6420,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Got a paddle?
7710,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"You go first, Sam"
6425,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Remember when I asked 'What if there's a bear?' and you said 'Would 5,000 years of genetic evolution steer us wrong?'"
6589,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Trust me, you've got bigger fish to fry."
7257,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,What's our strategy for managing upstream risk?
7219,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Does he look full to you?
5562,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Go ahead. I'll be dead in an hour, anyway."
6881,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"Gloria Steinem or no, I could really use a bicycle!"
6725,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,We have carbs!!!
6503,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,'The salmon from Puget Sound has much more protein than us '.
3309,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,"... And sometimes the bear, well, he eats *you*."
6954,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,Is my E-ZPass tag not working?
7218,1539,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,I thought you said swimming up stream was a better idea? It looks like it goes down hill from here.
6853,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,We were told to come home for dinner.
6736,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Don't tell me luck don't play a part.
7610,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I said downstream, Larry, but noooo, you insisted on upstream."
542,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Can I ask you to take a moment and consider how grossly unfair life can be?
7530,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Bear in mind that I told you to take the other fork in the river.
6858,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Wouldn't you really rather have a V-8?
6721,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Strength in numbers, Jim. We can take him down."
6731,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Oh, no, we're going to miss the family reunion!"
545,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Um, does it matter to you that I've been genetically modified?"
7618,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,When you said 'getting up these falls was a bear'...I didn't take you literally!
6856,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Rock, paper, scissor"
6854,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Shoulda stayed on the farm, shoulda listened to my old man"
6720,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Sam, the GPS didn't show this hazard!"
6801,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Um, lunch a go go!!!!!!!"
7608,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I can't bear it.
6818,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Without a selfie?
7572,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I loved you in The Jungle Book.
6790,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Guess who's coming to dinner. I think he's here.
7575,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I told you Arnie, the drought is not going to stop us again this year...."
6824,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,So what's Leo like?
3611,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Some of my best friends are bears.
6793,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I can do this all day.
6827,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"No, I don't care if your feet are cold, and no, I don't wish to join you for breakfast."
6786,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,So that's what the GPS meant by 'bear left at the next waterfall'
6785,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I recommend the trout.
7544,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Hey! Get outta the way stupid.
5885,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Penelope, I don't care that the sign said no u-turn."
7578,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,We're just farm-raised. Wild-caught are coming along behind.
5854,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Could'a swore that statue just moved.
6787,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You smell like GMO salmon!
3599,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm also a big supporter of the anti-fur movement.
3496,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I hope that's a Care Bear
6815,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you we should have taken the fish ladder
7561,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Didn't you know you were swimming upstream to a sushi bar?
640,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"It's either a chef or him, you make the call"
7564,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,That's the Ursula Major they told us about when we were in school.
6805,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm a little gamey. He marinates in dill and moisturizes with butter.
6799,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,This bear doesn't shit in the woods!
3591,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"What are you looking at, you big hair ball!"
6807,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Oh no, don't take me I'm farm raised. Wait a bit till the next one comes. He's wild and sushi grade."
6810,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Maybe you don't understand. You guys get to hibernate every year. We get our...uh... honeymoon, only once in our lives!"
6811,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I can't wait to get home and see if Mom kept my room just the way I left it!
7567,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Hey, I'm swimming here!"
6812,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I would rather watch this on TV
6813,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Did you get my friend request?
6796,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I swiped left! I swiped left!
6814,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Dude, you mind? The ladies are waiting."
6794,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Next time you go right and I go left.
6777,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Remind me to update my GPS next time
6776,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Are you farm raised or wild caught?
5557,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Back off, buddy. We're from Flint."
7580,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Welcome to Chez Spawn. Will it be smoked or non?
6757,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The fat will alll go to your hips.
7590,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I told YOU it was a right down stream, but noooo, you said keep to the left."
6755,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,One last big jump Hilary!
7593,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You might want to reconsider. I'm from Flint.
7535,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Haven't I seen you on the cover of 'Field and Stream?'
6849,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Are you a Gummy Bear?
6753,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'd rather you eat me than see Trump get the Republican nomination.
6752,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Are you the bear everyone is talking about?
6751,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I wasn't expecting a bear but love will find a way.
6749,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Jedi Speak, 'These are not the salmon you are looking for...'"
6748,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"The first one to hit my mouth, will be joining me for join me for dinner."
6747,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Wolfe was right, we can't go home again."
6746,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I must warn you that I am not GMO free
7533,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Can I at least get in a quickie first?
6742,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Which way is Obstetrics?
6758,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Looks like a Democrat. He'll probably flip a coin to decide which one of us he wants.
6737,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,This is why I always bring a friend on a Tinder date
6759,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Bet you wish you were farm raised.
4564,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,LOOK! Your fly is open! Your fly is open!
6774,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,SockEye...And that's what you'll get if you try and bite ME!!
6831,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,In your dreams.
6771,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Boy am I glad you guys have shown up! This waiting game was giving me cold feet!
6832,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Don't bother with us, we're farmed."
1936,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Don't look now, but I think Leonardo DiCaprio is behind you."
7543,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Just keep the pressure on; he'll eventually get cold feet.
7540,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Too much omega-three can be toxic.
6839,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Friend or foe?
3628,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Damned GPS!
6767,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"We're not sushi-grade, and the salmonella will kill ya!"
6841,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Come to mama bear.
7539,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'll give you three wishes.
3639,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Sometimes it nice to be the other fish
6761,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Sorry I'm late getting upstream ... am I off the hook?
4656,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Sweetie, did you leave the front door open?"
4660,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,What do you mean' bear left up ahead?'
6765,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Okay Bob, nice swimming with you. looks like this is my stop..."
7233,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I didn't realize you were using 'swimming upstream' as a metaphor.
6715,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Hey, sugar bear!"
6456,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Let me pass ..if you want food next year!
6455,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Life is hard, and then...."
6453,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,A couple of steps closer and I think you just might get me.
6450,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I don't suppose if I told you I am a Flint River salmon it would make any difference?
6449,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Which way to the spawning pool?
6097,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Swimming upstream is hard enough without you standing in the way.
7772,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The health benefits of fish are highly overrated.
6099,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Honey, I think we might need to reschedule baby night."
6443,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I just peed in the water. You're probably gonna want to get out.
6442,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Do you accept Jesus into your heart?
7771,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I think I left the water, running."
7775,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,It's all upstream from here.
6433,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm starting to get bearish on this river.
6431,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm much bonier than that guy.
7780,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Seriously, why not consider flaxseed as your main source of omega-3s..."
6430,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"My friend here may look skinny, but he has more omega-3s"
6429,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"If you find anything good to eat, let minnow."
6428,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Now we're in for it. I told you we shouldn't leave school early.
6427,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Don't just stand there, can you gimme a hand up?"
7782,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Psst. Eat him, he's genetically modified."
6116,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Just take a few more steps down and you'll be able to reach us. No really. Why would I lie?
7784,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Wow--I thought 'You can't go home again' was just a saying.
7777,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Well don't just stand there looking smug, gimme a hand."
2651,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I don't think she cares that we are farm raised.
6461,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Fast food!
3204,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,So much for following my instinct!
5207,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You have beautiful eyes.
7735,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The campers downstream have candy bars. Jumbo size. Caramel.
6513,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,What are you? Plankton?
4899,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,What's that? It wasn't there when we went downstream.
2486,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The mercury free salmon are behind me!
7739,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Honey, can you check Google Maps one more time?"
6506,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Which way to the Throgs Neck Bridge?
4907,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I think we misheard about this stream having Uber.
6496,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I know we made a truce but it's Friday & I've converted to Catholicism.
7751,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"No, I'm not going to eat you. But we have to put on a good show. Discovery Channel is here."
6467,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,'I only eat certified organic'.
6493,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Watch it Pooh – I'm full of mercury.
6489,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Are you aware that the surgeon general says no more than one-half serving per day?
6485,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Now this is live streaming.
7757,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Have we met?
7758,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Sometimes the bear eats you.
6481,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Let's go see where I was born, you said, it'll be romantic, you said."
6478,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,What do you mean you forgot the bear spray?
7759,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Eat him, he's lemon-pepper."
7760,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"To be honest, we're actually farm-raised."
6472,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"He said he'll leave the money for you up around the bend, under the rock."
6469,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You realize this is a catch and release stream.
6490,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Come on, you know why I'm here. Give me a break, and I'll let you watch."
6515,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Things are going a bit uphill.
6417,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,So not worth the effort
6414,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Thanks for scaring off those humans.
6196,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You are late for lunch
6204,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm waiting for the red fish blue fish!
2984,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I thought you said 'swimming upstream is a bear'!
7822,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,This is what's known as Roe v. Wade.
6315,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Small world, your grandfather ate my grandfather and Timothy Treadwell."
5126,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Have you considered going vegetarian?
7828,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I’m a catch-and-release kind of fish.
7830,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Do you know how far it is until the next rest stop?
5043,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"No, no ... wait for our far tastier brother. He's right behind us!"
2957,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,They told us you'd be sh-tting in the woods!
7818,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,He swiped at Mom back in '08.
6221,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,So this is what I get for going boldly in the direction of my dreams.
2949,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,staring contest
2826,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You were right. Maybe we should've used our frequent flyer miles.
7839,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You wouldn't want me - I'm genetically modified.
7840,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,My mother was right. Marrying you will be the death of me.
6292,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Hello, Sashimi"
7842,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Let's be herbivores about this.
2917,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I didn't even want kids...
7853,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my ecosystem.
2887,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Come on, buddy, just give us 15 minutes"
7854,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Can't we just sit down and reason this out?
7836,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Ask not for whom the bear toils.
6415,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,All my elderly elatives warned me about this.
95,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Wait... Did the directions say 'bear right' or 'bear left'?
7814,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Surprise me with something insightful.
6412,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I knew your mom
6411,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Salmon? We're Chinese lionfish!
2666,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Ahh...How long have you been standing there?
6409,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Sorry, we can't spawn when others watch."
7787,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I had such high hopes for our first date.
3114,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Excuse me while I kiss the sky.
7792,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Uh oh. I'm afraid we're heading towards another bear market.
7793,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,What if I told you we're endangered?
3101,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Bigger fish behind us.
7794,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm farmed he's wild.
2760,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,We're loaded with mercury.
3100,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I guess you weren't kidding when you said 'going home would be a bear.'
7795,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Walter, give me like three minutes, four tops. The wife is ovulating."
6390,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"A private romantic getaway, eh?"
2696,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm not locally sourced.
6147,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Janey you're now a star on animal planet
7800,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Oh, oh. I think we're in the wrong lane."
2716,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The next group is much higher in omega three.
2735,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Getting a rapid meal seemed hard to bear.
7807,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Have you got a license?
7809,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Wait, the really juicy ones come right after us."
6174,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,How's the fishing?
6136,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you we should have taken a left turn!
3491,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Look into my eyes
6044,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"'The party's over, we're on the endangered species list'."
6520,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you we should have adopted. But nooo... This was going to be 'romantic'
4749,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Oh.... S h - t!!!
6653,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I hope he doesn't have a fishing license!
5279,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Our intel said you were still sleeping
7660,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Hi, what's your niche in the ecosystem."
5962,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Okay. Now I get why swimming upstream is such a bad idea.
6642,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"No, I haven't read Thomas Wolfe. Now, you going to move or what?"
6641,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I don't suppose it's Catch and Release?
6640,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Going with the flow? What a wuss!
6639,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Look into our eyes and repeat after us. I am vegan. I am vegan.
6638,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"You're fine, I gave up fish for Lent."
6659,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Almost home, ladies. About 20 more miles and hang a left."
7663,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Why do spawning season and Lent always seem to coincide?
7666,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'd reconsider. I'm from Flint.
7668,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Just an FYI - we're low Omega-3 and not authentically wild - we just escaped from a salmon farm!
6630,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"At this moment, Sockeye, I'd rather be Sisyphus."
3407,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Ever feel like you're just the protagonist in an allegory of common sense gun legislation?
7669,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,It days like this you wish you were farmed.
7670,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I promise I'm not delicious. I just escaped the hatchery in Flint.
6626,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"The joke's on him, I'm not organic"
7672,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Ya know, Gill, this would really suck if we could feel emotions."
6624,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I have honey.
7674,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"From what I'm hearing, it's really all about portion size."
6634,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You needn't look so smug about it.
2296,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"On second thought, maybe kids just aren't for me."
6660,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,No I don't 'Know the Way to San Jose'
6670,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Shoot! I forgot to turn off my location services.
6714,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Be warned, I have AIDS."
7624,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,It never rains but it paws.
6712,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,It really feels like we're swimming upstream here.
6710,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Gulp?'/'Gulp!
6709,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The benefits of Omega-3s have been vastly overstated.
6707,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Well this is unfortunate.
7630,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Are you aware that we're a protected species?
3483,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Please tell me you are a vegan
7635,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I will build a wall to stop this.
6703,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Hang on, the whoppers are hot on our tails...."

1679,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Maybe this one's a vegetarian.
7291,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Well, it's all about the journey, not the destination."
6958,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I said, 'Bear left,' not 'Bear right'!"
6956,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The old neighborhood hasn't changed much.
6955,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Bill, I am really hoping that this guy is a Vegan !"
7290,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Actually you don't pronounce the 'l.'
7288,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You're sure this is the only way?
6949,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Wrong way, fishies.'"
6948,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Good thing we shorted the upstream bear market!
6946,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Gimme a break. I just paid off my freakin' mortgage!
7139,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Lead is not good for you Mr. Bear, i heard it will slow your growth."
5400,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Nuts and berries, they eat nuts and berries."
7427,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Did you really say 'Some days you eat the bear?'
7005,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,We've been vaccinated and might give your cubs Autism.
7093,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,What if I told you we're all farm raised?
5679,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Hope he's a Vegan.
1016,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Damn that GPS!
7056,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Remember what they said at orientation -- wave your arms!
1017,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Don't give me that look, I'm wild caught"
7055,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'd like to say a few words about my high mercury levels.
5459,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Seriously though, no one follows Paleo anymore."
7345,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I won't tell anyone what you did in the woods if you let me and my buddy pass
7097,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Looks like moving Uptown isn't as nice as we thought.
7099,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'll save you the trouble.
5683,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Wait - we're genetically modified!
7385,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Can you jump a little higher, please?"
6864,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Vladimir stalling the drive to Damascus...
7342,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I'll distract him, Marge, then you can make a run for it."
7053,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Dude, don't blow this. Tom Mangelsen's about to make us famous."
7386,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Talk about an existential crisis
1018,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'd think twice if I were you. We've just come Flint Michigan
7387,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"'Just so you know, we're loaded with mercury.' 're"
1008,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Just my luck, a pescatarian."
7372,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Your out of your element.
981,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Quick Marge! Did you pack that bowl of porridge?
983,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,'Recalculating....'.
1486,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Look's like we're heading towards a bear market.
977,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Well, that's it. Tell O'Malley I did all I could."
7078,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Looks like this isn't gonna be my year
990,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"On the other hand, if I get past you, I get to breed."
7068,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Let's hope he's vegetarian!
7374,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I've braved a thousand miles journey upstream so you could have lunch?
7067,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Bears!!!, it's there an escape clause in our contract?."
7370,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"You got screwed by the Academy, I'm telling ya!"
7082,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Oh c'mon you're barely jumping.
7085,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Okay, those jumps are rated 8.5 and 8.0 respectively. Now let's try for a nine!"
969,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Your wife called... She said she wants chicken for dinner tonight...
7371,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I cannot bear swimming upstream anymore.
7060,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"So, you want to play chicken?"
997,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Knock knock.
7368,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I don't have to swim faster than the bear, I only have to swim faster than you."
7050,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I know he will kill us, but he says what's on his mind."
7102,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Actually, Sven, the only one I have to outswim is *you*."
3929,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Watch your mercury levels.
7024,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Excuse me.
7410,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Don't be fooled -- I'm genetically modified.
7023,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Fine, I'll ask him for directions!"
5488,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Yes, I know we're a cliche, but we're an iconic cliche."
7411,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Doesn't look like he'd be moved by the story of our exhausting intrepid journey upstream
7128,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Will you be my new friend?
7412,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I hear the caviar is to die for.
7323,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I heard the sex was worth it but I'm not so sure now.
7414,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you Google maps had some hiccups.
7318,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Are you sure this is the right stream.
7424,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Still on the berry cleanse, my friend?"
7010,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You're really making this too easy.
5703,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm having second thoughts about this spawning business
7135,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Don't choose me...I was farmed with artificial coloring
7136,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"'Scuse me, need to get through."
7137,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Stay very very still, that's what they say to do."
7011,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Stop smiling, I'm still angry!"
7408,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Marge, I think you picked the wrong river cruise."
7406,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I thought you were off on Sundays?
7404,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"You know, these streams are pretty crowded as it is. The responsible thing to do would be to turn around and go back."
7390,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Did you say 'bear left'?
7105,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Real bears don't eat sushi.
7106,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,We should have updated our map app!
7107,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,We're off-limits. It's a leap year.
7047,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,RAINBOW! .....darling!
7044,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Gimme a break. It's our first date.
7110,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,The dude from Titanic went that way...
3998,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,In hindsight it DOES make more sense to go the same way as the stream.
936,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I'm not a natural salmon. I was raised in a farm and am chock-full of artificial nutrients, growth hormones, and some stuff that doesn't have a name. You might want to give me a pass."
7039,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Jump, scaredy-cat."
7038,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"No, we haven't seen Mr. DiCaprio."
7036,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"No, after you."
7115,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"In my mouth, or on a bagel. Your choice."
7116,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,But the sign said bear left!
7034,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Of course two sides are included! Does a bear...?
7033,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,What...what do you mean you want to meet your biological father?
5447,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I'm flattered, but you're not my type."
890,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,This isn't just about us. Think about the future of our children and generations to come.
7195,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you we shouldn't take the scenic route!
7076,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,uber for salmon has it downfalls
6893,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Why does he keep babbling about forest fires?
7507,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Move your fat ass!
3714,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I told you it was a bad idea to take the Bear Mountain Bridge.
7203,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,This is why we need GoPros!
7240,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Dam removal! Dam removal would solve everything you said! Happy now?
6879,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Just how wild are you two?
5566,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Not salmon for dinner again!
1140,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I think we can take swimming upstream out of the playbook.
5564,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Going with or against the flow, it's a matter of perspective."
7515,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Fred, looks like I might be late for our meeting. Traffic is Grizzly today."
7504,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I don't think we are going to make it to 10,000 steps today."
6912,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Franken-fish meets Franken-Bear
7493,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I've always wanted to be the one that got away.
7213,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"You know, sometimes I just feel like I'm swimming upstream."
6906,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Don't pull the wingman card Gary, I know what 'tip the bouncer' means here."
1151,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,You're not making this any easier.
7509,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Looks like we got here between swallows
7242,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,This is more than I can bear.
6907,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Happy Darwin Day!
7492,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Right now I wish we had been raised on a farm.
7270,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"It's been a good run, but I see a bear market ahead."
3687,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Same time, next year?"
5809,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"I said, “Let’s take the new fish ladder.” But you said, 'No that’s socialism.' Didn’t you, Harold?"
7202,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"The slow, fat one is just behind me."
6910,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I'd say this is your most flattering angle.
5397,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Yes! Take me, and not my plump, delicious friend!"
6895,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,We are so spawned.
7488,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Go back to bed. It only feels like spring.
7211,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Swimming up stream is much harder than I thought it would be.
6877,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I value your upstream thinking.
7496,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Seriously, it looks like its going to be a brokered convention"
7497,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Look, I'm all about the circle of life - but isn't this a little much?"
7508,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,I think we misinterpreted 'bear left' in the directions.
6898,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,In a bear market our stocks tend to go down.
1822,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,Can I see your fishing license?
7225,1583,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,509,"Same old upstream, spawn and die routine."
