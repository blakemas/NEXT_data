1682,0,6,27,33,1.1818181818181819,0.06818181818181816,524,I can forgive you for destroying my village--but you will pay dearly for spoiling last week's Game of Thrones!
1682,0,8,36,44,1.1818181818181819,0.05881787629278459,524,I'm assuming you don't get much practice with a sword.
1682,2,4,38,44,1.1818181818181819,0.07465726673576988,524,Gas prices are killing me.
1682,0,8,36,44,1.1818181818181819,0.05881787629278459,524,Don't expect me to sympathize with you on your COPD.
1682,0,8,36,44,1.1818181818181819,0.05881787629278459,524,"Did I say fat? No, it makes you look full figured."
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,I was hoping maybe we could roast a few marshmallows after the match.
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,Remember the rules.
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,"Tough without a thumb, eh big guy?"
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,My name is Inigo Montoya. I am not left-handed.
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,"Oh, Barney ... you won't see him no more!"
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,You're jolly right. This is more fun than Dungeons & Dragons.
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,I up your roar with this warrior pose. Namaste.
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,"Evas foul beast, your foot work be as lousy as your political view."
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,"Hold on, I have a blindfold for you too."
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,This is a lot more interesting than tilting at windmills!
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,So you think slaying you is fun for me?
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,you sure have small hands for such a big guy.
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,No use in huffing. I won the coin toss.
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,"Fine, Mom! I'll log out and do my homework."
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,An unfair match... I forgot my shield.
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,Spar-B-Q
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,"I told you, it's harder than it looks."
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,"If you are gonna be my right- hand dragon,you need to learn to defend yourself."
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,'I told you not to kiss that frog'
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,"Oh right, you were the bloke who sat behind me in Fencing school."
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,"Hold your fire. I'm the warm-up for the main event, St. George."
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,Dragon lives matter.
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,"See? Isn't this new technology so much more useful, practical and civilized?"
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,HBO ordered another season....so pardon my cockiness
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,"Don't forget, I'm supposed to win."
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,Think of it as a teachable moment.
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,It didn't work this way on Game of Thrones!
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,It's not fair using your right hand.
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,"Sorry, HBO cut our fire budget."
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,That's good but work on your thrust.
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,First Rule of Engagement: no fire!
1690,1,5,33,39,1.1794871794871795,0.07228481371574673,524,How to maim your dragon.
1690,3,1,35,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08901769276135213,524,"So, no spoilers, what's the situation with your mom, is she available?"
1690,0,7,32,39,1.1794871794871795,0.062254049094039386,524,These hands are not small
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,What if we call it Professional Development?
1690,2,3,34,39,1.1794871794871795,0.08108404256841999,524,Did you order the hot wings?
1726,1,6,38,45,1.1777777777777778,0.06581953356624205,524,You never reach for the check.
1726,1,6,38,45,1.1777777777777778,0.06581953356624205,524,"Oh come on, at least look like you're trying."
1726,2,4,39,45,1.1777777777777778,0.07309112127323451,524,You'll never defeat me with those tiny hands.
1726,0,8,37,45,1.1777777777777778,0.05763774795025092,524,Face facts my friend --Your wings and arms have atrophied; your fire is gone. How else are you going to strike terror into hearts?
1726,1,6,38,45,1.1777777777777778,0.06581953356624205,524,This playing field still isn't level.
1726,1,6,38,45,1.1777777777777778,0.06581953356624205,524,"Though you're long on fiery combativeness, it's short arms that will bring about your extinction!"
1732,2,2,30,34,1.1764705882352942,0.08926904831050918,524,"For what it's worth, my full quote was that I'd slay those draggin' my name through the mud."
1732,1,4,29,34,1.1764705882352942,0.0786538733437084,524,I can't believe I agreed to hold my fire.
1732,1,4,29,34,1.1764705882352942,0.0786538733437084,524,New emission standards hit the battle field.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,I see you forgot your nicotine gum again.
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,What do you say we skip the fire round?
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,It's not rigged. These are the rules.
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"Relax, sword play can be the best part!"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"Ok, once more, and we’ll take a break. This time, keep your wings behind you, and don’t let your opponent make you mad."
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,I'll show you what my 'little hands' can do.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,Someday Joseph Campbell will write of this--win or lose.
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,You're my new low cost exercise program.
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,"I said, no smoking!"
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"I said ""thrust,"" not ""parry!"" Let's think of another weapon you might be able to use."
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,"If it was my challenge you could have chosen flamethrowers, but you challenged, I selected too short swords."
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,Just wait. We agreed flame-throwing comes after the sword fight.
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"No, it's your turn to play the dragon."
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,You challenged me.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"You wanted to join the EU, so you have to play by the rules"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"Now all we need are marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers and we've got s'mores!"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,George couldn't come today.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"Ok, big shot, let's see you fight like a man."
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"After this, I'll teach you ""Rock, Paper, Scissors."""
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,"Sure, where was that long arm when the check came?"
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,Sword play is more fun than spitting fire BECAUSE you're reducing your carbon foot print!
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,I promise this will help with you improve your balance and focus.
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,But it's much more fun to play with your food than eat it!
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"This is why you win in the regular season - home field advantage means swords, not fire."
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"Call me 'Little Jackie Paper' one more time, sir, and I will run you through!"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,That's right---I'm the long arm of the law.
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,"We both have swords. Therefore, it's a fair fight."
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,There must be an easier way to make a living ?
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"Swords only, no fire."
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,See? I told you it was more fun to fight fair!
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"Prepare to be skewered and broiled, little man."
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"I meant it as a compliment--where I come from, everyone has one arm shorter than the other!"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"Ok, now you say, 'Dragon who'?"
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,"Why do I have have to fight by YOUR rules, George?"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,Mom always said the fencing lessons would pay off.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,I'm ready for a smoke break.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,Did I mention I'm a close personal friend of Puff?
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"Don't whine. You chose to duel, my choice of weapons!"
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,I hate it when my pilot light goes out!
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,Just wait until I get back my old spark.
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,This is the last time I trust the choice of weapons to Rock-Paper-Scissors.
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,That's it! Keep the tip up! You'll never be able to defend yourself if you don't learn how to use a sword.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"So I guess, fire breathing was an urban legend."
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,What's the matter? Never fought a southpaw?
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,"Not so tough when your flame burns out, huh?!"
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,"How about it, best 2 out of 3?"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,This is only one upside of having opposable thumbs!
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,"It's on, dragon breath!"
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,Don't worry you will still get a participation trophy after I slay you
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,Okay so you're better with a sword. Let's try breathing fire next.
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,Isn't this more gratifying than that fire-breathing thing.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"...But Sire , you chose the weapons !"
1735,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,524,Well done! Now you teach me how to breathe fire.
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"You know, they're going to cut our scene from 'Game of Thrones'."
1735,2,3,35,40,1.175,0.07915823166939519,524,"Just so you know, I do have Plan B"
1735,0,7,33,40,1.175,0.060843430844447585,524,What did you expect .... a slingshot?
1791,2,4,40,46,1.173913043478261,0.07158892194335345,524,"Feeling your Wheaties, Buster?"

1792,0,6,29,35,1.1714285714285715,0.0646349059597627,524,Do you want a shield?
1794,1,5,35,41,1.170731707317073,0.06898602743283391,524,"Didn't you see the 'No Vaping' sign?"""
1794,2,3,36,41,1.170731707317073,0.07732130480071882,524,On guard.... Puff The Magic Dragon!
1794,2,3,36,41,1.170731707317073,0.07732130480071882,524,I'm an ENT specialist. Let me take a look at that throat.
1794,0,7,34,41,1.170731707317073,0.05949419959829497,524,Would you consider being a frenemy?
1794,1,5,35,41,1.170731707317073,0.06898602743283391,524,DreamWorks how not to train your dragon.
1794,1,5,35,41,1.170731707317073,0.06898602743283391,524,"Puff, make our fight look real. I want to impress the maiden watching us."
1794,1,5,35,41,1.170731707317073,0.06898602743283391,524,Draconian measures may not be in the public interest...
