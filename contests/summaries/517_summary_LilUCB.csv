54,3,2,4,9,1.8888888888888888,0.3093202423794456,517,I know you are used to settling things out of court . . .

83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,Didn't I ask you to wear a tie?
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,The prosecutor's asking for life.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,Is there anyone who can corroborate your whereabouts who isn't dead?
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,The caselaw is unsettled as to what a life sentence means in your situation.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,I have to say things look pretty grim.
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,"For now, we'll leave getting the hung jury to me."
83,1,5,2,8,1.875,0.22658174179374144,517,"I think you need to say more than, ' I was just doing my job.'"
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,Unfortunately they just found the Scythe.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,Did you have something to do with the hung jury?
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,You're looking at life.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"Look, I'll do my best, but you should have paid your taxes."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"No, that's not what habeas corpus means."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,It's not going to help to tell them you invented the death sentence.
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,"Do me a favor, if the judge decides on the death penalty for you, don't giggle."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,The worst you can get is life.
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,Where's the jury?
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,Try to avoid eye contact with the jury.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"When I said professional attire, I meant suit and tie."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,What the hell. Plead guilty.
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,I am afraid you are looking at life without parole...
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"Bad news, you could get life."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,The judge would like to plea bargain with you.
83,1,5,2,8,1.875,0.22658174179374144,517,You really gotta stop showing up at the scene of the crime.
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,"Honestly, your only chance of getting off these charges is winning an election to public office"
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,"I'm sorry, but ""its my thing"" is not a defense."
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,"I have to be honest, the outlook is grim."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"Tell the truth, you were just doing your job."
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,"The prosecutor says that if you don't accept a life term, he'll be seeking a death sentence... I'm not sure what that means here."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,That isn't what I meant by 'business attire.'
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"""Name"" will be a problem. ""Occupation"" will be worse."
83,3,1,4,8,1.875,0.35038244411336755,517,We can always say you had a tough childhood
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,It's a parking ticket. You can't ask for the death penalty.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"Remember, you showed him to the gates of Hell, but he walked through by himself."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"On the bright side, the penalty is named in your honor."
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,Juries can be tough on repeat offenders.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,"So, what happened to your last attorney?"
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,If we win don't hug me.
83,2,3,3,8,1.875,0.29504842217604116,517,There's no way they can prove it's your scythe.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"If we're lucky, we'll keep you from yourself."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,We're trying to get you life.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,You realize you're facing life?
126,3,0,4,7,1.8571428571428572,0.4040610178208843,517,I know you'd prefer a hung jury.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"Well no, technically, it's not a jury of your peers.."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Look if we lose it's not going to kill you.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Remember, he was dead before you got there."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"So, do you have any priors?"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,I think you're misunderstanding habeas corpus.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Opposing counsel is willing to cut a deal...his mother-in-law lives at 42 Maple Lane.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"Remember, you were just harvesting grain."
126,3,0,4,7,1.8571428571428572,0.4040610178208843,517,I can't object. It's actually called the Death Penalty.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"We're good, as long as they don't bring up your priors"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Your chances look pretty grim.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"I don't think ""It was his time"" will sway the jury."
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"If the trial goes as planned, I should be able to get you the death penalty."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,I'll represent you pro bono in exchange for air conditioning and reduced sulfur.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,Eternity is the best sentence we can hope for.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"How about, 'If the hoodie doesn’t fit, you must acquit!'?"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Wear a suit and tie tomorrow, okay?"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Just think, this trial has us both staring at death."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,The jury's returning. Try not to look so grim.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,We win this in the sentencing phase.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,It doesn't exactly help when the penalty is named after you.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,I told you not to wear the hoodie.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,Try not to intimidate the witnesses
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Remember, you were only the ferryman."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,They’re offering to reduce your time if you increase theirs.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Truth be told, our chances of winning this case are looking pretty grim..."
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"Take the plea. Otherwise, you're facing the You penalty."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,They'll let you walk if you testify against the other horsemen.
126,0,6,1,7,1.8571428571428572,0.1543033499620919,517,That's your idea of business casual?
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,I'm afraid Death's still on the table.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Actually, it doesn't matter if you are death destroyer of worlds - she still gets the house"
126,3,0,4,7,1.8571428571428572,0.4040610178208843,517,Perhaps you don't understand. In your case the death penalty is considered a punishment.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,It will help with the jury if you appear a little less grim.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"..and then if you get Death, how does that work?"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Self defense. Really???
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,I understand that you are just as certain as taxes. But you still have to pay them.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,I remind you again. This is not a death penalty state.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,Would be best to keep your job out of the alibi.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,'Just doing my job' is no defense.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Ironically, they're giving you life."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Try looking less grim.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,Time to reap what you sow.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,I’ll do this pro bono if you do me a little favor …
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"Yes, I know you have some experience with plea bargaining, but let me handle this."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"So if I win this case, I'm off the hook?"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Stop pointing at the witnesses.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,It's important that you don't laugh when they mention the death penalty.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,She also wants your scythe.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Don't worry, it only feels like eternity."
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,So what makes you think you were profiled?
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,If you're just tapping people on the shoulder... I think we can get you off on a technicality.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Stop looking so happy when they discuss a possible death sentence.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Just to recap: you did it, you'll keep doing it and that's that?"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Don't worry, I rehearsed: if the sickle doesn't fit, you must acquit."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Claim you were unfairly profiled.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,I'm afraid that could be construed as witness intimidation.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"It was her idea to put it in the vows: ""Till Death do us part."""
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"You can't plead ""It's my job"" to the murder charge."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,...and stop staring at the jury. It's intimidating.
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,I'm pretty sure I can get you life.
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Why don't you handle culling the jury pool?
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"And remember, saying ""the devil made me do it"" probably won't sit well with the jury."
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,"Trust me, they can't sentence you to you."
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"No, I'm sorry, you cannot execute yourself"
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Apparently, the 'open carry' law doesn't apply to scythes."
126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,'It was his time'? So we're going with that?
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,Are you the habaes or the corpus?

126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,I'm sorry. They've sentenced you to life.

126,1,4,2,7,1.8571428571428572,0.26082026547865056,517,Try to show some remorse ….
126,2,2,3,7,1.8571428571428572,0.3400680204068024,517,"Okay, so we agree; I'm going to go with 'If the scythe doesn't fit, you must acquit.'"

207,4,4,7,15,1.8,0.22253945610567472,517,The judge asked if this is your first offense.

214,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,517,I'd prefer a life sentence.
214,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,517,"""I was just following orders"" is not going to work for you."

214,1,4,3,8,1.75,0.25,517,I take it you would be okay with the death penalty.
214,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,517,I'm afraid it looks grim...
214,1,4,3,8,1.75,0.25,517,I recommend that you plead guilty and demand the death penalty.
214,1,4,3,8,1.75,0.25,517,Can anyone testify you sent them to a better place?

225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,Maybe try smiling
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,Jury of your peers? Ah... I don't think so.
225,0,5,2,7,1.7142857142857142,0.18442777839082927,517,Now try to not look so grim.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"Relax, try not to look so grim."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Bad news. They're going for the 'you' penalty.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,I know you have to be at st. Barnabas Hospital in 15 minutes but this is important.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"It's probate court. Your here as the ""executor"" not the ""executioner""."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,We're looking at life without parole. They're looking at death without a scythe.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"Let me do the talking, and remember, you have never been to Panama."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"He sentenced you to life, just for the irony."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,I think our best hope at this point is a hung jury.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,I made a deal with the jury they couldn't refuse.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Bergman still won't settle - insists you're 'public domain'.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"Remember, state your name as Mr. Reaper, not Grim Reaper."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Think of the irony if they give you life.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,You didn't tell me you had actual skeletons in your closet.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"you're not the judge, jury, nor executioner"
225,0,5,2,7,1.7142857142857142,0.18442777839082927,517,"If they ask, you've never seen that scythe before in your life."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"Worst case scenario, you're looking at life."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Try to be less grim.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Remember: if the scythe doesn't fit...
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,You're not likable enough for us to risk putting you on the stand.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,It would have killed you to wear a suit?
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,You might get life.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"If it's a life sentence, we'll appeal."
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"Just answer the questions clearly and directly, and remember, no pointing."
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,I'm fairly certain that you'll not get life.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"Don't worry, nobody liked her."
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,At least try to show remorse.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Good news. They're willing to take Death off the table.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"Ironically, you could get Life...."
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,I think the hoodie might give the jury the wrong impression.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,The good news is you'll never get life.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,Don't forget...smile at the jury!
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"I'm dead if I lose this, right?"
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,I'm afraid the best we can hope for is life.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"I'm sorry, but it looks like you'll be sentenced to Life."
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,I'm worried the cloak makes you look unsympathetic.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,You certainly don't seem too concerned about the death sentence
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"Yeah, keep staring real hard at the jury members."
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"Remember, I'm doing this pro bono."
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,Don't forget to smile.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,Where on earth did you get that fantastic hoodie?
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"Soooo, no matter which way the jury goes, we're OK. Right?"
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"Any chance tomorrow you can wear the plaid outfit , you are scaring the jury"
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,The worst you could get is Life
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Are you sure you want to deliver the alimony in person every month?
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,I take it you don't care about the death penalty.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,The hoodie isn't helping.
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,Hey one to two millennia beats life.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,He's known as the hanging judge. So you're good.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Death be not proud--so it's okay to take the fifth
225,1,3,3,7,1.7142857142857142,0.28571428571428564,517,"Remember, a smile goes a long way."
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,Don't mention your day job.
225,2,1,4,7,1.7142857142857142,0.3595159254890833,517,"As your attorney, I must warn you that the hoodie may give the jury the wrong impression."
307,2,3,5,10,1.7,0.2603416558635552,517,"For the last time, this is traffic court. I cannot request the death penalty."
307,2,3,5,10,1.7,0.2603416558635552,517,It's evidence; you'll get the scythe back after the trial.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"What I'm saying is that, as a defense, ""it was his time"" doesn't give me a lot to work with here."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I don't think 'It's my job' is a good defense.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"Congratulations, it's a hung jury."
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,You can't ask for the death penalty instead of paying your parking tickets.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Just say you're looking for the real killers.
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,Remember: she was dead when you got there.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,I promise you won't get life.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Do your prefer Grim or Mr. Reaper.
309,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,517,Do you have a blue suit?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Let's hope justice is blind.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,You've got stop saying 'It was just his time.'
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,There's a hole in your story.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"I'm your perfect lawyer, I've got no soul."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,We have to do some real work here to overcome your bad press.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Could you stop glancing at the judge and then checking your watch? It's not helping us.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Would it kill you to smile?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"Frankly, the hoodie isn't helping."
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,I don't think we can get a continuance for all eternity......
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,I was hoping you would wear your blue suit with the red tie.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"My client has a great alibi. That night Irene died, he was at Heather's place. And Gertrud's place. And John's..."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"I'm not suggesting anything, but juror #7 has a heart condition."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'll simply explain you were just doing your job.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,Of course you're guilty.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"When you get on the stand, try looking a little less grim."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Our best bet is to try to get your sentences to run concurrently.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,You could be sentenced to life.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'm not sure that this is the time and place to be rockin' a hoodie.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'm glad you took my advice and left the scythe at home.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'm afraid we can't get you on death row.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,The judge has decided to move the trial away from Sleepy Hollow....
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,The jury has a sense of humour. They're suggesting life imprisonment.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"You did say you were innocent, right?"
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"The guilty verdict is disappointing, but I'm pleased with the death sentence."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I told you to wear a sweater vest.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,He was already dead when you got there?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,It's a class action on behalf of...it says here...everyone ever.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,"No, you can't be the executioner."
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,"Oddly enough, I'll be paying a visit to Juror No. 5 this evening."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"Even if we don't win, we've got a great shot at a miniseries."
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,"So, what happened to your last lawyer?"
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"Hi, I'm the devil's advocate."
309,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,517,There is no death penalty in this state.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Let's forget about making eye contact with the jury.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I have a feeling the sentencing should be right up your alley.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,You were advised to wear a suit and tie
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,There is a hollow ring to what you say.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'ts Your Honor not you're next !
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'll tell the judge you were only doing your job
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"For tomorrow, I'd suggest the light gray pin-stripe with a red tie."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,You seem to be making Juror #3 very nervous.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,"So, I assume you want the death penalty."
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,"If you don't take the plea deal, the prosecutor's going to seek the life penalty."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Don't you have a nice blue suit?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Let me guess...A wrongful death suit?
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,Is this really what it takes to get a hearing from the Republicans?

309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,The judge was lenient. You got the death penalty.

309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,They only have two alternates so go a little easy on the jury pool.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"The IRS case against you is weak, but nothing's certain ..."

309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,I feel good about the jury. We were able to strike all the Blue Oyster Cult fans.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Try to smile more for the jury.

309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"We'll try and downplay your employment history, OK?"
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,"No, we can not ask for the death penalty, you were arrested for trespassing."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,They've asked you to take the death penalty off the table.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"We haven't discussed this yet, but I'm open to bartering when it comes to my fee."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Remember. You're just the messenger -- just doing your job.
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,I gotta be perfectly honest here. Your situation is pretty grim.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,How do you feel about the death penalty?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Hung jury it is.
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,The first thing they will try to do is find a jury of your peers.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"No, a hung jury isn't what we're looking for."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I said a business suit AND a tie.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I wanted to let you know that I have really enjoyed this internship.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"I'm not going to lie, it's starting to look a little grim."
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,You don't agree with a stay of execution?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"""Technically they aren't your peers, but at least they're all seniors."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'll try to get you death. But they may stick you with life. (italicize or underline try)
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,No. I deliver the closing statement.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,You have no witnesses. No one has ever come back from the dead.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,The death penalty would be too ironic.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,I think we can cut a deal if you let some of them live
309,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,517,I think we can get it reduced to manslaughter.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I'd suggest you lose the hoodie.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,"No, I maintain that ""his time had come"" is not an effective defense."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,The Judge told me to tell you that he likes your robe better than his.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,I don't think you can invoke the 5th Parallel.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,We can’t lose. What jury is going to risk pissing off Death?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Best case scenario is they give you the death penalty.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,"I know Angel Of Death is your real name, let's just go with Irving Lipschitz, like we discussed."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"If the scythe does not fit, you must acquit!"
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,Don't worry. Taxes has agreed to testify.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,My fee is negotiable.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"On the positive side, your priors are inadmissible."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I agree the Judge looks sickly but I specifically said no to the hoodie!!
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,This is my first death case.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"No, you MAY NOT hold the scythe when you get on the witness stand."
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,I don't think a jury trial is the best idea.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"Ironically, you've been given life."
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,"Apparently, the court is having a problem finding unbiased jurors."
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,You do know they are asking for death?
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,It's kind of ironic that you got life.
309,0,4,2,6,1.6666666666666667,0.21081851067789187,517,I feel like I'm playing devil's advocate here.
309,2,0,4,6,1.6666666666666667,0.42163702135578385,517,Good news. The prosecutor agreed to the death penalty.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Population control is not a defense.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,"Well yes, if six or more of the jurors suddenly died at the same time a mistrial would be declared, but what are the odds of that happening?"
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,If they find the sickle.....we're in a pickle.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Habeas Corpus? Seriously?!?
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Their best offer is anger management 7 times a week.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Try to let the jury see your lighter side.
309,1,2,3,6,1.6666666666666667,0.33333333333333326,517,Thanks for not bringing the scythe today.
463,2,3,6,11,1.6363636363636365,0.24393468845452254,517,Tell them you can't take the whole day off.
463,2,3,6,11,1.6363636363636365,0.24393468845452254,517,It would really help if you could think of at least one favorable character witness.
465,0,5,3,8,1.625,0.18298126367784998,517,I told you not to show up in your work clothes.
465,1,3,4,8,1.625,0.26305214040457564,517,You'll be lucky to get life.
465,1,3,4,8,1.625,0.26305214040457564,517,"""Frankly, our chances of finding someone to testify on your behalf are pretty slim""."
465,1,3,4,8,1.625,0.26305214040457564,517,You having nothing to worry about. The witness never saw your face.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Well, at least you're not grim."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Her attorney wants your soul too.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Look, your fingerprints are all over these murders, so the best we can hope for is life."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I don't care how many millennia you have been around or how many places you have been, only judges wear robes here now."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We'll just say it was self-defense.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Well, at least we don't need to worry about the death sentence...."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Things are looking pretty grim I'm afraid.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Joint custody is off the table.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"No, I don't think they will charge you for every human since the beginning of time."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"OK. Let me explain something about an affirmative defense. First, you must stop replying to every question with ""Damn you!"""
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Remember what I told you: You're just God's coroner.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Remember, the victim touched you."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I don't suppose you can suggest any character witnesses?
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Now you want to apologize?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I don't think you need to worry about the death penalty.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Juror number three is pro life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Try not to laugh when they ask for the death penalty.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,With any luck the prosecutor will ask for life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The prosecution will try to get you to grin. Don't.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Try not to look at the jury. Ever.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No, I don't think your smile is what's making the jury uncomfortable."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,No laughing when they give you life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Look, I'll try for appeal, but they've got you on 55 million murder charges for last year alone."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Look, the most important thing is that you not lose face."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Trust me, you want to keep the hoodie on."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,What do you mean this is my last trial?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Trust me, without the scythe, they've got no case."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I'm having a difficult time finding a witness to confirm your alibis.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We'll win on appeal. We'll call the horsemen as witnesses.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm sure you'll have the last word on this.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"If the cloak don't fit, they must acquit."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I can get it reduced to manslaughter.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,If you settle this one everybody's going to sue you.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I thought I told you- only the judge wears a robe. Now sit quietly and stop beckoning to the jurors.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I strongly advise you not to use the Twinkie defense.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We won't settle. They can't leverage the death penalty.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,They want to sentence you to life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"If the judge gives you the death penalty, try not to laugh, OK?"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm with the NRA. We're taking your case pro bono.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,They're offering life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"You're going to have to stop saying, ""No lives matter""."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Wait, am I paying alimony for as long as she lives or as long as I live?"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Relax. You're not going to get life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You're my father?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I don't think they'll seek the death penalty. Too ironic.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,He's dead to me.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Good news--they'll settle for a restraining order.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Just remember they have to prove you were there.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"I agree, speaking in public is scarier than death"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"""I was just doing my job"" is not a good defence."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Remember, we plead the fifth if they ask about age-related bias in your selection process."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Their case is pretty circumstantial.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The good news is they're requesting the death penalty.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Do your best to avoid eye contact
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Our goal here today is to remind the jury that you are just the messenger and guide - not the perpetrator.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The outlook is grim.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"""Our 12 friends might think the robe's cute, but the scythe could be a problem""."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,The evidence is pretty damning.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I told you the judge would not appreciate you wearing a matching robe.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Just sweet talk 'em
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Don't worry, you said they didn't get a good look at your face."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,They're starting to run out of prosecutors.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Just remember, if the sentence is life, we can always appeal."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We're calling Dick Cheney as character witness.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,At least try to look friendly.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No pun intended, but you have to face the facts"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,What's this about an appointment in Samarra?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Relax, in your case the death penalty is nothing to worry about."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We plead not guilty on the grounds of mistaken identity
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,They think you could be useful on death row.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"We can beat those murder chargers, it's the parking ticket..."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Don't worry, I think I can get you the death penalty."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No, you can't have your scythe in the courtroom."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"When you identify the perpetrator, don't point."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I have bad news. The death penalty's off the table.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"For the next two weeks, I'm going to need less grim."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Your Honor, my client utilizes an agricultural hand tool, professionally."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I just want to confirm - You only came to me because you need a lawyer.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Does the Angel of Death have any ideas? Because I'm out of ideas.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Do you think you could do anything about juror number 3?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,No fingerprints on the scythe - we're good.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,That witness is looking a little sick. Need I say more?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No, we're hoping they're hung, not hanged."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"A hung jury, Mr. Reaper, is not what is not what you think it is."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"If you plead guilty, I think we can get you life."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Sorry, apparently pre-reapering is a crime."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You of all people should appreciate the certainty of taxes.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Tell me you're not thinking of jury tampering.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No, this would NOT be an appropriate time to tell the judge his sentence."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I understand your excitement, but this is not Texas."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Try not to be too dark.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Our only chance is to play the grace card.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"When I asked if you had a dark suit, this isn't what I meant."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You realize you're getting life?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"""You're going to get the life penalty""."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Please try not to laugh every time they mention the death penalty.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Given the number of victims, I don't think we can expect much leniency."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,This would be a good time to look every juror in the eye.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I'm assuming no appeal if you're sentenced to death!
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I'll let you do the closing argument.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I thought that ghostwriter was just an expression
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,It's looking like afterlife in prison.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,My guess is you don't want Life without Parole.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,We might have a problem getting the death penalty off the table.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The verdict is looking grim.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,It's a death penalty case. You win either way.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Don't worry. Without the scythe, they don't have a case."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Remember your occupation is, ""paradigm transition specialist."""
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"'I got the trial delayed until tax season so your crimes wouldn't seem so bad."""
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I don't think you will get the death sentence.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm afraid you may have to go underground for awhile.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Trust me. You're dead. This double indemnity defense is gonna work.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Please, no jury tampering."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Don't complicate this by giving them the death stare.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,And your profession is still viewed favorable to mine.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,i will see if i can get you life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I object...can I object?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We really need to change your image.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"If you're found guilty, you'll get life."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"If the prosecutor asks you to state your name, just plead the Fifth."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,The good news is that they decided to take the death penalty off the table.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I think you're possibly looking at life.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"Sorry, but this was a tough case."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"Remember, you can't face the jury."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Relax, this is a witch hunt. It's not you they're after."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You're not doomed.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,At least you won't have to worry about the death sentence.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No, that would be cruel and unusual in this state."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I'm not going to lie to you, things look grim."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I know it's warm in here, but DO NOT take off your hoodie!!!"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The Bible catching fire didn't help.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You look like death.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,They don't exactly 'give you' the chair.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You of all people should have realized the certainty of taxes
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"They can see the guilt on your face."""
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Don't worry—You'll fit right in on death row.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I'm afraid things are looking a bit grim, Grim."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I'm thinking this is my last case.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"And to think, they called me an empty suit!"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Any last words?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Looks like you're going to get ""life""."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Were you being honest when you said you didn't kill him?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I'm certain, you will have to pay the taxes."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"When you said underworld, I thought you meant mob related."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"""We've got this - no one's ever cheated you yet."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You've got to show them you're not just an empty robe.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Death becomes you.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You may want take the 5th.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Don't mention your occupation while you're on the stand.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,It's good news...you got life.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"Well, in your case, it is kind of a win-win."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,We are going to contend it was part of your job description.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Look alive.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Our only chance is a change of venue to hell.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You're dead.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Luckily this jury is as pro death as they come.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm just saying that shouting 'I've got your death penalty right here!' wasn't a great way to start.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Remember, you're taking the Fifth."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I presume you're taking the Fifth?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The death penalty is still on the table. Our only hope is a hung jury. Can you help with that?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"For the last time, It was His Time, is not a viable defense"
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"Fortunately, there are no witnesses."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"I have to be honest. Things are looking pretty grim, Mr. Reaper."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"So, you met Justice Scalia?"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Yes, you... and taxes."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Just take the fifth if you're asked about taxes.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"When I told you to take the fifth, I didn't mean dimension."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Do you have any character witnesses?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Insider trading...? Really?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,It would help if your alibi didn't involve killing other people.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,So what if I didn't help you in my last incarnation. I promise to do better this time.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,That's not how jury nullification works.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Just remember when the time comes I'm doin this pro bono.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You might like it on death row.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I'm going to be honest -- it's looking grim.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"First of all, in the court of law, ""habeas corpus"" does not mean ""take the body."""
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I thought we talked about this. The jury doesn't like hoodies.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Just don't point at anyone.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"If the sickle is too little, we’ll get an acquittal."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"'Let me do the talking now, Donald'"
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"So, how innocent can you afford to be?"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm going to argue that you are a victim of profiling.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Getting a venue change to the underworld might be difficult.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,They are having a tough time gathering a jury of your peers.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,There's justice then there's blind justice!
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,This is traffic court. I can't ask the judge to give you the death penalty.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Have you thought about pleading guilty?
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"On the good side, nobody can identify you for sure."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I asked you to wear a tie.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"Face it, the outlook's pretty grim"
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Not what I meant by your 'best suit'
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Sorry buddy, I think you're getting life."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I'm sorry Mr. Reaper, but your chances of an acquittal are grim"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"""Be more specific, how many trillions""?"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"As your attorney, I need to know where your head is at."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I don't think we're going to get much traction arguing that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,It's looking grim.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The Force is not with you on this.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No, a hung jury does not mean they all die."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The prosecution rests in peace.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The death penalty is off the table. But they're seeking 30 years to life at the circus.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"""No offense, you come across a little grim.""."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,At least we got the death penalty off the table.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The fact that it's your job does not constitute a legal defense.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Would you like a mint?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"No, he didn't mean 'hung jury' literally."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Try to look innocent.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Next year you should just pay your taxes
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Guess a death sentence hits close to home, eh?"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"On a side note, keep sending those ambulances, and I'll keep chasing'em."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I think we should go with the insanity plea.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"Spin it how you like, no one believes you're the life and soul of any party"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I assumed you didn't have fingerprints.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Try not to look so grim, Mr. Reaper."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,It's the Supreme Court. I don't think they recognize any higher authority.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I already sold my soul.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I need to warn you that you could get life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I have never seen such a blatant case of profiling.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Don't appeal the lethal injection. You'll still be home for dinner.
469,1,4,5,10,1.6,0.22110831935702663,517,That's not what a hung jury means.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Of course I said ""coat and tie"" and not ""cloak and scythe."""
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Did you go over all your aliibis?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I'm pretty sure they're not going to let me enter an appearance as ""devil's advocate,"" what's your second choice?"
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,"Good news, it's only the death penalty."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We're getting some push back on work release.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,I don't know what will happen if the judge sentences you to life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"As he looked into the face of Death; Hanratty had second thoughts about bringing up the subject of ""Billable Hours"" to his client."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We may want to reconsider our self-defense plea.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Yes, Texas does have the death penalty."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,We can get you off the pestilence charge on a technicality
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'd like to ask for a continuance.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,You reap what you reap.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Bad news. Their attorney is Daniel Webster.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm afraid just arguing 'his number was up' isn't going to get you acquitted
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You should plead Inevitability.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Should I have worn the blue one?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,What? I just got this dry cleaned.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Finding a jury of your peers is terrifying.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Arguing against the death penalty does seem counterintuitive.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I advise you to stop pointing at members of the jury.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Hey, it's called reasonable doubt."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,They want to sentence you to life. How ironic is that?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"I know you killed him, but did you *kill him* kill him?"
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Ironically, they want the death penalty."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,It's the worst possible verdict. They gave you life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,I'll get the case dismissed for your inability to face your accuser.
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,'It's time we take about my bill...'
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,How many?
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Remember, you're just a harbinger of death - not the root cause."
469,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,517,Don't be so grim.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"In your case, the death penalty is a winning situation."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"Its looking pretty grim Mr. Reaper """
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,You could get life.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,The State of Texas cannot execute you a second time.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Existentially speaking...... I don't think we can lose.
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,"This is traffic court, there's no pleading guilty and asking for the death penalty."
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Does this mean life!
469,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,517,Try to look less grim.
727,1,5,6,12,1.5833333333333333,0.19299604852813634,517,"Now they will read each of the 107,343,279,045 counts."
727,1,5,6,12,1.5833333333333333,0.19299604852813634,517,Is there anything between the Black Death and World War II you're not telling me about.
729,2,0,5,7,1.5714285714285714,0.36885555678165877,517,"If that's your innocent look, we're doomed."
729,0,4,3,7,1.5714285714285714,0.20203050891044222,517,You need to take the next witness.
729,0,4,3,7,1.5714285714285714,0.20203050891044222,517,Don't give me that blank look.
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,I don't think 'but that's what I do' is going to fly with the jury
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,You're early. Sentencing is tomorrow.
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,Do not show any emotion.
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,Just think of it as a holiday.
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,Relax. You were just doing your job.
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,At least they cannot give you the death penalty.
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,"There's no DNA, so just say the scythe doesn't belong to you."
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,"Yes, the witness looks like death warmed over."
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,"The evidence is overwhelming. However, I think I can argue that the search for your scythe was unconstitutional."
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,I just really think you should have gone with a coat and tie.
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,"I know, hooded creepy guys matter, I totally get it"
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,It seems all witnesses for the prosecution have recently suffered fatal accidents.
729,2,0,5,7,1.5714285714285714,0.36885555678165877,517,"If this were Texas, the ""He needed killing"" defense might have worked."
729,2,0,5,7,1.5714285714285714,0.36885555678165877,517,Please try to cut back on the ominous pointing today.
729,2,0,5,7,1.5714285714285714,0.36885555678165877,517,"Look, I told you she'd take you to the cleaners in the divorce. Be happy you still have your job."
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,They can't prove it's your scythe...
729,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,517,"No, I don't think we should go for the death penalty. Why do you ask?"
749,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,517,"Look at the bright side, you might get life."
749,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,517,Stop worrying. The worst you can get is 'life'.
749,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,517,"Yes, you are death. But the IRS is going to argue you still have to pay your taxes."
749,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,517,I'm not sure how I could get you life.
749,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,517,"And remember, no mention of your contacts in the underworld."
754,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,517,"I can get you eternity, with 10 years off for good behavior."
754,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,517,"It's ok, we're claiming it's required by your religious beliefs"
754,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,517,"Don't worry. I'm going with the 'if the sickle don't fit, you must acquit' defense."
754,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,517,If the Scythe doesn't fit they have to acquit...
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"They'll drop everything else, but you can't avoid the tax charge."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll have a better chance if you lose the hoodie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You might want to remove your head covering.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think the judge wants to play chess with you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Good news. I got you the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Judge Harry ordered you to leave your scythe outside the courtroom?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I'm sorry but you have to admit it's a little amusing that it's called the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think the death penalty is our best option.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Unfortunately, this is a class action lawsuit."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You appear to be a habitual offender.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm not sure the death and taxes argument constitutes reasonable doubt.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Would you settle for life?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Try to show some emotion.
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,Don't worry. They'll be happy to make a deal.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you're beyond double jeopardy.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Yes, it's slimming, but it's not helping your defense."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Okay, I understand that but I worked hard to get your conviction thrown out."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"How do I send the bill, to the campaign or him personally?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Trust me, the facts speak for themselve."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I told you to wear a shirt and tie... and for Pete's sake don't bring that scythe again.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Perhaps I should deliver the closing argument instead.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're saying that I'm still on the hook for this?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We're okay; scythe open-carry is legal in this state.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You'd be surprised how few interns choose tax law.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, this time it's about taxes."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're definately not helping my anxiety.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Just because is not a motive.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"No, you cannot plead ""taking a holiday."""
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They said they found your DNA on the scythe.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"If you're lucky, sentencing will take an eternity."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,These juror absences are starting to seem suspicious.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You are going to be the death of me yet.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I told you, be not proud. Juries hate that."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"It's habeas corpus, not habeas corpse."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"""What do you mean you don't think juror number 11 will make it to the end of the trial""?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"In your case, the death penalty might be preferable to jail time."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The hoodie is not helping us.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Would it have killed you to put on a tie?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The death penalty is not an option in Traffic Court.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, a life sentence would be pretty ironic."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Are you really suggesting ""depraved indifference""?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just out of curiosity, what's going to happen when you place your hand on the Bible?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Yeah but it turns out taxes are more sure.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The worst they can give you is life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You must testify that he died of supernatural causes.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I wouldn't worry. Their evidence is purely circumstantial.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Take the plea.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Stop saying, ""Reap 'em and weep."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll do the talking. You do the pointing.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's face it... Anything you get is a death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think we'd have better luck if you lost the hoodie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're right. Hung jury.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm so tired of these wrongful death lawsuits.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Looks like the death penalty is back on the table.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They're demanding complete transparency.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry. They may find you guilty, but you won't get the death penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Our chances are looking grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sorry but this state no longer has the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Do not plead guilty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"If they ask what you do for a living, ix-nay on the eth-day."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Who's calling who an empty suit?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The irony is they want to give you the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Would it have killed you to wear a tie and jacket?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The deal is, if I get you off, I never see you again."
758,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,517,It doesn't matter that his name was on your list.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Am I the Victim, or the Defendant?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Remember, let me do all of the talking"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Just don't look the jury in the eye.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Try to look a little less mortified.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Just tell them you lost your head.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,This case is driving me to an early grave. Please stop smiling.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're innocent until proven inevitable.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Sure they took it. You could seriously hurt somebody with that thing!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought this was business casual. I wore my hoodie.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Jeepers Reaper, Stop being a Creeper."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"""Could you at least have worn a tie""!"
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"Now remember, our defense is that you were just following orders."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You will be less threatening to the jury without the hoodie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You went to Vassar with Bob? His brother, Jim used to live in my building. Small world."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,Just doing your job? Nobody’s gonna buy that one.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm thinking that taking the stand in your own defense may not be our best strategy.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,How about if we just let him think he's the final judge?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You're killing me with this ""for all eternity"" talk."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge doesn't like hoodies.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"If all else fails, we'll ask for a writ of Habeus corpse."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Look, we're in lower Manhattan-it'll be a jury of your peers."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Technically, your execution would be death by suicide."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We're going to call it a 'butter knife.'
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, . . . Explain to me again how you made partner. . ."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'll try, but I can't promise you the death penalty."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Your hoodie makes you look guilty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"In order to beat the prosecution, we need to get you ahead."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, the judge is offering YOU a plea bargain."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"It's 107,602,707,791 counts of 1st degree murder."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Watch out for Juror #4. Her grandmother just died.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Look at it this way -- the worst that'll happen is that you'll get the death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Alright! Another death penalty!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Please stop looking that way towards the jurors.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Do you have any cloaks in soothing pastels?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"If you're found guilty, they'll give you *you*."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,This is not what I had in mind when I told you to dress for a somber occasion.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You got life.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They say your DNA is on the sickle.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, it's important to make eye contact with the jury"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Since the hood didn't fit, they must acquit."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, you can't request the death penalty as damages in a civil trial."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,They are going to ask for the you penalty
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,In your case I think going for the death penalty is overkill.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Could you have at least worn a tie?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Seriously, don't worry about this. Trump sues everybody."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You have the right to remain deathly silent.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,But don't you at least want to hear my closing first?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Any chance juror #6 won't still be with us by the end of the trial?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,My wife told me this case would kill me.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"In spite of the preponderance of evidence, I think you are coming off really well."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"That ""Line Up"" ID certainly is not going to help our case."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I never thought you'd be on trial for insider trading
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Remember, when you take the stand don't act proud."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You’d seem more sympathetic in a pastel cloak.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you... the death penalty's off the table!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The D.A. is offering leniency if you testify against your Boss.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,How many victims ?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"In my view Mr. Reaper, I don't think an entrapment defense will fly."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Just don't point at the judge.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,In order to win we have to change your image!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You realize it will be hard for you to deny these accusations.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It means that your request to be appointed legal guardian has been denied.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Don't forget to look directly at the jury and smile.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You know, there are a lot of people who want you dead."
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,"I'm pretty sure I can get the terrorism charge dismissed, but the TSA and the judge aren't buying your ""farm implement"" excuse..."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You don't give me any confidence in your legal expertise.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We can't just ask for the death penalty as our first motion.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I will try to get them to call you just Mr. Reaper.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,No. I wouldn't suggest you try to make eye contact with the jurors.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I'm only 30, I've just billed 99 years of work to my clients."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you there would be Grim Reapercussions!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,So let me see if I understand you. You want to plea me down to death?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Maybe you could kill less people.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Try not to point at this new judge.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The judge gave you life...but don't worry, it isn't what you think."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,This is going to be so ironic if you get the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You of all people should know a continuance is out of the question.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,It's an all white jury. Lose the hoodie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,...asking for the death penalty is unprecedented.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Have you pissed anyone off?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If we lose this case, you're dead to me."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Seriously? Even the judge's childhood pet gerbil?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I don't care if it was his time, do not kill any more of the jurors."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We need a better defense than “his time was up.”
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I just don't think an assisted suicide defense is going to work in your case.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"And remember, only answer the question asked."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Well, it's ""death penalty"" with a lower-case ""d"" so your brand is still safe."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,My best advice? Be not proud.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You have nothing to lose.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Are you here for me or my case?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think we can plead lack of intent.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Do you go by Grim or Mr Reaper....
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll sum up for the jury and you take the penalty phase.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"""It's my job"" is not a valid defense."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,If I put you on the stand they'll see right through you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Eternal damnation seems reasonable
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Even death deserves a good defense.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,What did I say about wearing a hoodie in court?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You can kill me, but I can audit you."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"""Reaping what you sow"" is not a good defense."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you take the stand, they may only see a hood."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,the judge insists that we habeas him a corpus.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We maybe able to use this in your defense. Tell the truth. Did you want to be the Unabomber or Dopey?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm going to need you to stop hanging the jury. Thanks.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You couldn't shave?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I told the judge you'd be willing to extend his life sentence if he gets rid of yours.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"If you're lucky, you'll get the death penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,This is not my doorstep.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"Yes, your best chance at this point would be a hung jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You think Juror Six can be gotten to?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes,I think first impressions are pretty damn important."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm sorry. But the irony would be too much to ask the judge to overturn your life- in-prison sentence, just because you hate orange."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"When you take the stand, don't be yourself."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Ironically, we live in a state that doesn't support your penalty."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I'll argue that when the defendant claimed ""Life's a bitch and then you die,"" she entered into a contract."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Now don't forget. If we overcome the optics you have a shot at getting away with murder.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Would you prefer a life sentence or a death sentence?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,This outfit is not helping our case!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Try not to be so grim.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"Look, stop grinning at the jury. It's not working."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll leave the closing arguments to you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Honestly, he was dead when I got here."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I tried..but when you're dead you're dead !
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, the irony does not escape me."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You didn't tell me you were sleeping with her.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Remember, our client's life is in your hands."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You should have paid your taxes.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You probably shouldn't have worn the hoodie today.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We can negotiate a plea to avoid a life sentence.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Do you not own another suit?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we can get you off with life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm afraid you're sentenced to life. But it is without hope
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Don't blame me. I told you to lose the hoodie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Not to worry- if the motion fails, we can file a writ of Habeas Corpus"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,But she is allowing the hoodie due to your special circumstances.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you're asked, just say that you met Dante in college."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It's an open-and-shut case. Nobody remembers your face.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Character witnesses may be an issue.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Look. There's no way I'm putting you on the stand. I think your best bet is to stare at juror #3.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It is going to come down to whether the mask fits.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Well, congratulations, you got the death penalty. But you can expect they're gonna give it the ol' college try anyway."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,But doesn’t a plea bargain for a life sentence seem a bit ironic?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Look the jury in their souls.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, everybody knows death is certain. But so are taxes, and that's why we're here."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The worst sentence you could get is life.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,Permission to treat the witness as hostile?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,As your attorney I must caution you. You could get life.
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,I'm sure you'll appreciate the irony of 'life in prison.'
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Is that blank stare is working for you?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I say we go for one count of hospice.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We're gonna have to work on your image.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Are you SURE the Devil made you do it?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,... would a change of clothing have really killed you?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Let's get Juror No. 2 ""removed"""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Well you tell me. ..You're the expert in the death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,At least I have a nose.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"And whatever you do, do not stare at the jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Can you show the jury a little remorse?
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,I thought I told you to put on a suit and tie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't tell the judge you knew his mother.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you're looking at the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I see where you're coming from and I don't like it.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I know, I know. I'm annoyed it's called a penalty, too."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought you'd buried the evidence
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The next time you're questioned, try to avoid the maniacal laughter"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"For God's sake, what did you expect? The penalty is actually named after you!"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"There is precedent - if the mask doesn't fit, they must acquit"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Perhaps it would help if you remove your hoodie.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You're in luck--he's a hanging judge.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I really don't think they'll believe you're a monk.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If it's any consolation, they named the penalty after you."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They want you to try on the hat.
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,Let's forget about eye contact with the jury.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,So we really need to establish ownership of the pale horse
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,What's the worst they can give me?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,How do you know the jury is hung?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news. Taxes is turning state's evidence.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We have to prove this guy had a death wish.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"When you take the stand, don't say, ""He had it coming."""
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"No, I don't know why they call it a penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,So you say that your career interests have led you to seek a spot on death row?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think the death penalty is off the table
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Good news: the prosecution couldn't find anyone willing to testify against you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Be advised, the pen is mightier than the sickle."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You've got a little something between your teeth.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I need you to look alive when you take the stand.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Tell the jury you'll save them a place in Heaven.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You've got to stop saying 'All Deaths Matter.'
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,My bad! I thought you would have loved the death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I am confident I can get the death penalty off the table.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,No smiling when the eye witness takes the stand.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,In my opinion...... your chances are grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mr Reaper, if you know anything about that scythe, now would be the time to tell me."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mind you, outside Texas we'd call it a misdemeanor."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Avoid eye contact with the jurors
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,What happened to my straw man?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Its 'Death and Taxes', not 'Death or Taxes'."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Yes, it's called a 'wrongful death' suit, but don't take that personally."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Relax, we've been through this billions of times."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I realize that you've been doing it for millennia, I just don't think that's a viable defense..."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You should know better than anyone that when you don't pay your taxes, this sort of thing becomes inevitable."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,The prosecution claims they can connect you to any murder.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Luckily, they can't extend prison sentences to eternity."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I'm also a tax attorney
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I tried to tell you. ""Friend of the corpse"" is not a thing."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"No, pessimism will not win your freedom!"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, they're going to eye roll if you say, 'I'll see you in Hell.'"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, I'm excellent at playing the devil's advocate"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You've been sentenced to death. Then again, that's probably your call when it actually happens."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,A hung jury is a win for us.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I'm not worried. In this county, you always get a jury that's mostly undead."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The jury will never accept a plea of 'You could be next.'
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Would it have killed you to have worn a suit?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's not a jury of your peers, but a jury of their fears."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You might be sentenced to life...
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I don't think the preexisting condition defense is gonna fly.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I think it was a mistake to call Famine, Pestilence, and War as your character witnesses..."
758,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,517,Watch carefully. I'm going to kill this.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Anybody see you?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Worst case? You get life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, our position is ""Scythes kill people."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If there's no obit, they must acquit?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"When you say I'd better win this case, what exactly do you mean...?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think it would be in your best interest to avoid using your nickname.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Are you looking for a hung jury?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's use the Star Wars defense.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you don't look like a public defender."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I really think the jury is starting to see you less as the ""Grim Reaper"", and more as just ""Death""."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I can't tell the judge that your name is also your job!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,They have eyewitnesses. There's no way they confused you with someone else.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,A death sentence is the least of our worries
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I must advise you that it looks grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,This case is going to be the death of me.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Even with a consecutive life sentence, you'll be out in a day."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,no. I said death and taxes. Not death and illegal offshore tax shelters.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ditch the hoodie, just take the 5th."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Just tell them you blacked out.
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,I think keeping the scythe out of sight would be a very good idea.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,We can probably assume that the death penalty is off the table.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I take it that the death penalty is not going to be an issue.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I realize ""he had it comin"", but let's stick with self-defense."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,This is the one case where I advise leaving the hoodie on
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,A white robe would look better in the witness box.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Could you not have worn something else to the hearing?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Let's discuss the meaning of ""life""."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Your prospects are looking grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You know, this time, it's not your place to judge."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just so you know, the death penalty is off the table."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"When you're on the stand remember, it was Jimmy's scythe"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You gotta lose the hoodie
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The plaintiff is having trouble facing you.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,We might have trouble finding sympathetic jurors.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Your outcome is looking grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll plead down to mankindslaughter.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,My clients don't usually ask for the death penalty
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, you've never owned a scythe."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll argue mistaken identity.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Our best hope is to do in the judge
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Ironic, but it appears you will have to pay taxes."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I don't think 'just doing my job' is a sound defense in this case.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Relax. You look nothing like the police sketch.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Just this once take my advice and take down your profile picture and tone down your posts on Facebook.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Trust me, no one will ever vote to convict."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You realize seeking the death penalty for jaywalking is irregular.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I strongly suggest you take the Fifth.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Our ""mistaken identity"" defense seems to be working."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think you should plead the fifth dimension.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Relax. I specialize in getting my clients the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Listen buddy, I don't need my soul back. I expect my hourly rate in cash."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's face it. Your future looks rather bleak.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury isn't buying it -- cheating death just isn't a crime
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"They'll drop the charges if you help with these 7,000 cold cases."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Well maybe you should have thought of that before you decided to shake hands with my witnesses.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Tax evasion? Really? You of all people should know the certainty of taxes.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're probably looking at the death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"We cop a plea, I'll get you life."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Trust me. It's called the metaphor defense.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,They said you'll be given a fate worse than you
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Unfortunately, the “inevitability of death” is not a valid legal defense to murder."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the black cap."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,If you get the death penalty that means you get of scott free
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't show too much emotion.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,What exactly do you mean by 'a more hands-on approach'?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just doing your job, right?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The brothers will accept $50,000 and you agree to be called simply ""The Reaper"" from now on."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"When I said 'delete your profile', I meant Facebook."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I can promise you one thing, you won't get life."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The defense rests in peace.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,So we'll petition the court to vacate the ruling.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll ask for an adjournment to save face
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think it's better if you don't testify.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"You don't have much of a murder case here, I think we should go with insanity."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I suppose the Legend of Sleepy Hillow defense is an idea
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I know its not a jury of your peers...
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Please stop challenging the prosecutor to a game of chess.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,No expression is not a suitable substitute for a first impression
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, don't approach the bench."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,This case is the least of my problems?
758,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,"So, you are OK with the death penalty?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Why didn't you tell me about the scythe?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Credibility..may be an issue.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, they only got you on tax evasion."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If we can convince them you're Death, they'll probably give you Life."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,Don’t worry – just last week I got Pestilence off on a misdemeanor.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I've never seen anything like it -- seven billion restraining orders.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They're demanding the you penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I guess a death sentence is redundant.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You promised to wear a tie.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Enough with this alias stuff. No one's gonna believe you're the Grime Reaper.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, looks like you're getting life."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"And why, exactly, should we appeal the death penalty?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Well good thing for you you didn't kill all the lawyers
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Next time try to remember: Death AND taxes
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't suppose you could manage to show up in a pure-as-the-driven-snow color tomorrow?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you're looking at life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Are you crazy, of course we want the death sentence!"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think the best we can hope for is a hung jury.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Yes, I do see the irony of having to appear in tax court."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You want life? Listen, I'm a good defense attorney, but not that good!"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're in luck--all their witnesses have mysteriously died.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I'll call you as an expert witness during the penalty phase.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm your third lawyer. What happened to the other two?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Sorry, I forgot to tell you h-o-o-d-i-e is spelled g-u-i-l-t-y in here."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,What's the worst that could happen?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're being charged with 100 billion murders.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Try to tone it down. I don't think yelling 'I'll see you in hell' at the prosecutor is going to help your case.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Any sentence will be an death sentence.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If they ask about Scalia, plead the Fifth."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,What do you mean you can't do life?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,What do you mean who's taking over the case once I'm gone?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Keep a straight face.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,And you stole the scythe?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Honestly, I wouldn't worry so much about the speeding tickets."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"About my bill, I prefer cash."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mr. Reaper, the judge is going to send you away for a long time unless you send him away for a long time...if you get my drift."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, no...it's the other way around: stare at the prosecutor, not the jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I don't mean to rain on your parade, but the death penalty is serious."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Stop saying things look grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Trust me, changing your name to ""Morose Reaper"" will endear you to this jury!"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Excuse me your honor. My client just lost his head for a moment.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Here's the offer - you plead to one count of murder, and no contest to the other 6,999,999,999 counts."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Death penalty? You'll be fine.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's take the death penalty off the table.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm afraid the hoodie is a dead giveaway.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember to say, you 'kindly' stopped for him."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"You're early--the penalty phase comes after the verdict."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, the death penalty is not off the table."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Your case looks grim, Mr. Reaper."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's skip the race card and play the death card instead.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to wait until after the sentencing."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Jurors like humility. Don't keep saying that you're certain.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, I remember specifically asking you to wear a suit."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll get it reduced to life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I am afraid I will not be be able to represent you post-mortem
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Nothing is certain, Mr. Death, but taxes."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I'm afraid that won't work - they'll see right through you."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Is life-without-parole really an option for you?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I thought I advised you not to wear your hoodie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The judge is insisting that to dismiss ""prima facie"" you actually have to have a face."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Am I here for you or are you here for me?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The chances of a conviction are grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Please don't do your victory dance if they find you guilty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Knock off the ""Your time is at hand"". A simple ""yes or no your honor"" is enough."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Leave it on: nameless and faceless relates more to Everyman.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"What do you mean, you WANT life?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The hoodie scares people.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Reap what you sow
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, always make eye contact with the Jury, I think we are winning them over"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It would be going better if you'd stopped tweeting during the trial.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, the guy was already dead when you got there?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think we should ask for the death penalty
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You ""kindly stopped"" for her? What does that even mean?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Guess who's turning state's evidence against you--your good buddy, Taxes."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Thanks for leaving the scythe in the car.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Can we prove the reaping was an accident?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"It's nothing personal, but I think I'd like to represent myself from now on."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"You have to give them Taxes, it's our only chance."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,That's so hollow...
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It looks like the prosecutor is going to offer you life
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Just try to not smirk or roll your eyes under cross examination.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They can prove you're responsible for multiple deaths.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"One thing is certain: you're going to have to pay your taxes, Death."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,All I'm saying is that the eyewitness identification would be much less persuasive if you had worn a suit and tie like I asked.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,A 'hung jury' isn't what you think it means
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I really didn't think I was doing that badly.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,If your found guilty you could get life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It's looking kind of grim...
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I'm afraid the worst option has your name on it.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're gonna be the death of me.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"When I call you to the stand, leave the scythe under the table, OK?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Whatever you do, don't look at the jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't be so grim; you can only get life without parole.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The hood's ok, but you'll have to take the sunglasses off."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"They're asking for 10 to 20, but I think we can bargain them up to death."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It is, too, a jury of your peers; we're in Texas."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Plead guilty and you'll get life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"As your attorney, I advise you to keep the hood on."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Frankly, I think you should accept the plea bargain and opt for life."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The death penalty has no effect here.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,They are going to ask you why the email server was in your basement.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, you have a solid alibi. Someone else somewhere died at the same time as this victim."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,You keep saying hung jury like it's a good thing.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The good news is they've ruled out the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Didn't I advise against wearing the hoodie in court?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"In the ultimate irony, they're going to sentence you to life."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Probably better not to mention your boss by name or even location.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm not gonna lie. The odds look pretty grim.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Try to keep a straight face.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry. It's not that your too grim, it's the hoody..."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I don't think that holding out for ""life"" in prison is a reasonable option."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm dead serious...
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You're making jury selection rather difficult.
758,0,1,1,2,1.5,0.7071067811865476,517,How long have you been in mort-gage law?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think our best bet is to plead down to justifiable homicide.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It doesn't matter if it is for your job, no contact means no contact."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Trust me, the scythe wouldn't have played well with this jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,How many times do we have to go over this? It's you AND taxes.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Relax. They couldn't find any DNA on the scythe.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You really gotta stop making eye contact with the jury.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I'm willing to try a plea bargain of life in prison, but I don't think the judge will buy it."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Death be not proud. Let's settle.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Next time wear a tie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,So you will plead guilty as charged for doing your job?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I told you.....no eye contact with the jury!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Relax, there is no Life penalty in Texas."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Yes--I'm pretty certain you needed to pay taxes.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Your looking at a life sentence.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Santa Claus I could get off. You, not so much."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If the hood doesn't fit, they must acquit."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"When you’re called to the stand, don’t shake anyone’s hand."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It would be good if you smiled more.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I understand that you're the Grim Reaper, but the judge thinks he's God."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Ok good news: she gets the house, but you get the Anne Geddes Calendar collection"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It's important to make eye contact with the jury.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Just let me do the talking.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember - we're going for Harmless Reaper.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,And try not to ask the judge where he got his robe this time.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Here we are... Death and Taxes
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,If only we could remove juror #6
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,At least try looking remorseful.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Please don't look the jurors in the eye.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I really feel like you should have worn a suit.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, if they ask about the Black Plague, plead the Fifth."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I really don't think claiming self-defense is a good idea.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"We're *this* close to a mistrial, Dave... can you dial it down a notch?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Apparently your scythe is not deductible.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The good news is all one hundred and two billion sentences are to run concurrently
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I recommend avoiding eye contact with the jury.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're going to have to face facts!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I don't think they'll go for involuntary manslaughter.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I told you to wear a suit.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I'll move for a mistrial. If the judge says no, you kill everyone but me."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"You could get life, but you don't want that, do you?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Forget about it. He's NOT going to give you life.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Here's the good news, you don't have to worry about the death penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,At least you'll have your own row.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, you don't even know what a scythe looks like."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"No, the glove defense has already been used."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, no, no - You're GETTING the death penalty"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to look so guilty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember to wipe that silly grin off your face when you are on the stand.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's not me who's on trial here, Mr. Reaper."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Your outfit doesn't exactly scream ""Innocent."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, I don't want you coming across like just another empty suit."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,They've offered to take the death penalty off the table.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,There's no jury alive that will convict you.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The DA assured me the death penalty is off the table.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'd say your best bet is to remain silent.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Insider training IS a faceless crime.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,‘No Lives Matter’ won’t hold up in court.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The defense rests... FOREVER!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We will maintain that this is a case of mistaken identity.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, they are asking for the death penalty, but the good news is that they don't quite know how that would work in your case."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury is watching you every moment. Try not to look so grim...
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"My soul? Yeah, I'm afraid the Devil got dibs on that one."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Frankly, I don't think we have a ghost of a chance."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The death penalty is off the table, not that it matters."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Best case scenario, we get a hung jury"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember what we rehearsed--you were on holiday.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,In your case the sentence would be dinner with Donald Trump
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,They can't prove a thing without the scythe.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think they believe this was your first offense.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,There is a real possibility you could get the live penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Sometimes I get lost just looking into your eyes.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"When the prosecution says it ""rests,"" stop saying ""in peace"" afterwards."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You can't use that alibi. They will see right through you!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"'I was only doing my job,' probably won't help much."
758,2,3,9,14,1.5,0.20299948573528753,517,"Yes, but Johnnie Cochran's not around any more. And whose fault is that?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"No, getting the death penalty is not a good thing."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We probably can't argue mistaken identity.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Taxes got life but you'll probably get time served.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Before you get all excited, that's not what a ""hung jury"" means."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,And you're absolutely sure it was his time...right?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sorry you didn't get the death penalty. I tried.
758,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,517,The good news is the prosecution will have a difficult time finding witnesses.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Gasp! The hood fits.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, what kind of penalty did you expect?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Lets see how do I put this,I think the jury finds you off putting"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,So you want our plea bargain to be that you'll accept a death sentence?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought I told you to wear a tie.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm not the one on trial here you know. I don't appreciate your attitude.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Yes Grim, you have a Constitutional Right to testify, however I still urge you not to do so."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They're sentencing you to ten years in paradise.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ever since the plague, public opinion is running way against you - our best bet is a plea bargain."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you not to wear a hoodie to court.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,This may result in a redundancy.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The case is looking pretty grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, try to smile with your voice."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Please don't tell the sentencing judge that you're a long term advocate of the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Bad news, there's no death penalty in this state."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think leaving your scythe in the cloakroom was a smart move.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I hope the prosecution doesn't try to show that there is a pattern here.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I hear the jury is considering a life sentence...
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Not to worry. They don't call him the hanging judge for nothing.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, you were just doing your job."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"""Til death do us part"" does NOT give you carte blanche."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"How about, “His hands are so brittle; you must vote acquittal”?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Just try to sound sympathetic
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"For the last time, you're not pleading the ""scythe""!"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It's going to be tough—the IRS is as certain of their case as we are of ours.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"""I'm the only judge around here,"" said Death to his lawyer."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Honestly, I don't think that you should testify."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think anyone has ever plea bargained FOR the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We need to get the jury on our side. Look them in the eyes.
758,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,517,"Yes, death is considered a penalty here."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"When I put you on the stand, don't look so grim."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I asked you to not wear the hoodie.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Well, when you think about, the death penalty is not all that bad for you really."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Don't worry, you're not the most guilty person I've defended."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The judge strikes the jurors, not you."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,My job is to get you outta here alive.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If I get you out of this, can you promise me I'll never see you again?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Inevitability and taxes are not the best legal strategy.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Deny, deny, deny"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Income tax evasion? Really?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I'm afraid we can't use Faust as a character witness."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I get you the death penalty and you're complaining?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"The judge has to sentence you to death or life in prison. Either way, you're OK."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Honestly, let me handle this."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't understand. YOU are the statute of limitations.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I was just doing my job is not really a good defense in this case
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Traditionally, you don't show up until after the governor denies clemency."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Case deceased.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"After everything, I can't believe they indicted you for tax fraud."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Jack the Ripper is not the sort of character witness I had in mind.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Are you worried you will be or won't be sentenced to death?!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Should I ask for the death penalty?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I can get you a deal if you can live with it.
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,I may be going out on a limb here but I'm going to assume the death penalty won't be a major problem for you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, giving you the death penalty would be suicide."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think I have a conflict of interest.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Did they see your face?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"You""re late!"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think our best chance is to claim racial profiling. We should be able to get the 'black guy in a hoodie' description thrown out.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,They're arguing that the plaintiff's life was not yours to take.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The death penalty is definitely on the table.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,So it's not technically a hoodie. It still gives the jury an impression of menace.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,My affairs? Of course they're in order. Why do you ask?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll handle the witness; you handle the judge.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think if we can get the scythe thrown out we have a chance
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Didn't you get the suit I left with your doorman?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I've told you repeatedly, the death penalty is not a plea deal."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You don't have to worry about the death sentence.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It'll be a hung jury anyway.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I must warn you. Juries never find disappearing acts convincing,"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'd lose the hood. Show them you've nothing to hide.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,So you'll plead if you can get the death penalty?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,This trial will be the death of me.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Well, one' thing's for sure. We don't have to worry about the death penalty."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Your best option is to take the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,He's suing you for unlawful termination.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,The district attorney is going to ask for life. He says the death penalty is too good for you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You don't have any lips, so let me do the talking. Let me do the talking."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,There are pluses and minuses to taking the stand in one’s own defense. In your case I would go with the minuses.
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,Not bringing the scythe into court was a good call.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,My advice is lose the hood.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I've been hoodwinked!
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You know, the blue cloak makes you seem honest."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Tie! I asked you to please wear a tie.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Remember what we talked about. Try to be a little less grim.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,It's The People vs. the Undertaker. There's no way they win.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury needs to see your lighter side.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, but the jury isn't literally hung."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"When you told me you wanted to file for divorce, I didn't realize she literally sucked the life out of you."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, the death penalty would be redundant."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"No, the State won't let you self-administer."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The court's landmark decision in United States v. Death led to the break-up of the world's largest monopoly.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think I can get them to take the death penalty off the table.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,We can't excuse those who oppose the death penalty. You are the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, you only did it to get out of the 'hood."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,We really need to stress to the jury that a guilty verdict would be against the best interests of everyone involved.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Actually, a habeas corpus motion just might work."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'll do my best, but 187 trillion counts of murder is going to be tough."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,How do you even get ticketed on the Highway to Hell?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry--without the scythe they have nothing.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Our case is simple. Facebook has no right to reject you.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I understand that you were just doing your job, but 'prior bad acts' are admissable."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"That's not what they mean by ""Death Tax""."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I like that I'm not the most unpopular person in the courtroom for once.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think I can get them down to afterlife without parole.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Avoid saying ""dead right"" and ""dead wrong"" when you are on the stand."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"The judge is asking for continuance again. Looks like another set of jury members died of ""natural causes"" last night."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's probably best if you don't point your scythe at jurors and say ""you're next."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Face it, you're dead."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ok, now try to look alive during the cross examination."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll plead mitigating circumstances - you were just doing your job...
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I think plea bargaining for ""life"" would be pushing it."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, you cannot threaten the jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Of course they took it away from you. What do you expect? You just harvested half the jury.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Now would be a good time to show a little emotion.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm not sure 'Just doing my job.' is really the best defense here.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Your character witnesses just aren't panning out.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I can see the headline now: Death Gets Life
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Ironically, they want to give you life."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Didn't I specifically tell you to wear dress attire and definitely no hoodies.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The last thing you need to worry about is a death sentence.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think 'It's my job' won't work as a line of defense here.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Don't point!
758,0,3,3,6,1.5,0.22360679774997896,517,You're right again -- another 12 more jurors suddenly died.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,Just play dead - I'll do all the talking..
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"And for Pete's sake, don't make eye contact with anyone on the jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Relax. This isn't my first wrongful death case.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You're black and wearing a hoodie -- you haven't got a chance of acquittal
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The prosecution says you should be on their table.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Lawyer: ""Remember, they were dead when you got there."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, let's assume the death penalty is off the table..."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"If I’m going to get you off, you have to lose the hoodie."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,When you glance at the jurors you need to look less grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You're late, and Taxes had to testify with minimal preparation. Everyone in the defendant's shoes usually gets a life sentence, but now I'm not so certain."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"On the bright side, you'll feel right at home on death row."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Would it have killed you to wear a tie?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"To pick a jury of your peers, we need bottom feeders: foreclosure buyers, eviction specialists and conservative think tank linguistics artists who praise the need ""tax relief."""
758,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,517,"Look, it's nothing personal, that's just what the penalty is called."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Chances are, you'll really like Death Row."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're scaring the hell out of the jury.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I just got off the phone with the D.A. She said she'll put the death penalty back on the table, if that's what you really want."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"With your history of priors, I have to advise you to take the plea."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Self defense? Each time?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You're telling me you're not afraid of the death penalty?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Striking jurors is my job, not yours"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I don't think that,'It was his time', is an adequate defense."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Tomorrow I think you should go with the orange jumpsuit.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,There's not a soul in this place willing to testify on your behalf.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Has anyone seen your face?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I assume you have no problem with the death penalty?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It looks good. So far it's Scrooge's word against yours.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Relax. Each juror will only be thinking about the net time they meet you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,That's right -- the defense RESTS.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Maybe the police planted the scythe.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's make sure we get you a suit for the next court date.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Well at least the death penalty is off the table.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,What do you mean you have something to confess?
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,We actually GO for the death penalty--then double jeopardy on appeal. Agreed?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just cutting grass? No, that's not credible."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Their case is mostly circumstantial.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's wrongful, Death."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I tried to get you off, but they're insisting the death penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It may be a case of mistaken identity
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Relax. Without the scythe, they haven't got a prayer."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"As your counsel, I strongly advise you not to always close your statements with 'because I can'."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I strongly recommend against taking the stand.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Don't look so guilty!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I don't think a change of venue will help.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It means, 'Show me the body.'"
758,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,517,I'm going for the death sentence. It's your only way out.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I don't think we can find a jury of your peers.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't look directly at the jury, they'll consider it confrontational..."
758,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,517,"When they ask what you do for a living, plead the fifth."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They're checking for precedent on Habeas Spiritus.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Here comes the jury. Try not to look so grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Stop looking at me like that!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,A death penalty is a reach.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry. If the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It's not like they can give you the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The good news is they've agreed to have your 11 billion life sentences run concurrently.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I really don't think that it is a good idea to put you on the stand.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Relax..you're in good hands. I got Taxes off on a technicality last week.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know you feel cheated, but this is a good deal."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm afraid they may sentence you to life.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Couldn't you have worn something else?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The good news is they might sentence you to death.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we'll be able to avoid a life sentence.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Because he was just so annoying? That's our defense?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I asked you to dress modestly for court today.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Our strategy is simple-- go for the death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,We're going to go with the death sentence.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,They have to acquit. The sickle doesn't fit.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"But seriously, I love your work."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mr. Reaper, I don't think that hoodie helps your image with the jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,First we get the jury to like you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If we plea, we can avoid the life penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, you never touched the guy."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"We'll plead insanity, because you have no head."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's not genocide if you killed without regard to race, creed or color."
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"I don't think calling War, Pestilence, and Famine as character witnesses is going to help."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"When the judge says ""death"", that means a penalty, not an occupation."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You want to plead 'guilty as sin?'
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"We can make the motion, but I'm pretty sure it's still going to be called life imprisonment."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, but they can't prove that it's YOUR scythe."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"For the last time, traffic violations don't warrant the death penalty."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,None of the plaintiffs will be testifying.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"We need to do better than ""it's my job."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The best we can hope for is the death penalty.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought we agreed on the frilly pink blouse.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The situation looks grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Next time, just let me ask the judge if we can strike the juror."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Life without parole in your case is worse than death as I calculate it.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Please speak up. I can't read your lips
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"OK Grimm, please don't go ruin your defense by saying how soooo pro-death penalty you are."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,It's not looking good. They want to give you life.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"As co-counsel, I insist we seek the death penalty."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"After we close this case, I don't want to ever see you again, got it?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Yes, pleading guilty will get you life. Why do you ask?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Jumping the gun a little, aren't you?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you to ditch the hoodie.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Try not to look at the jury.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news. The police found the scythe.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"The judge may ask you to take your hood off, but don't."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Best-case scenario, I get you the death penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We need a change of venue--any place that's not Florida.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,He'll commute your sentence if you give him ten years.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, it was a politician. You did us all a favor."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. Time is on our side.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Look, just try to appear upbeat. This jury looks sympathetic."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The witness expired on New Year's Eve...'know anything about that?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I distinctly remember asking you not to wear that.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Just plead 'Guilty'. It's only the death penalty...
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"That special place for lawyers--I don't go there, right?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I've already explained this: ""I was just following orders"" isn't a legitimate defense."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The best we can hope for is a sentence of life.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I represent the IRS. And you?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Stop laughing whenever they mention the death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I suggest a different outfit at trial.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know it's what you do, but would it kill you to wear a suit just this once?"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Life without parole is your best bet
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,What are your credentials for being a death penalty expert?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,The bad news is they have a lot of witnesses against you - the good news is none of them are available to testify.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Take the plea and we'll have you out in half an eternity.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I do not think the other lawyer's nickname is scarier than yours."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,At least they can't sentence you to death.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Your chances for acquittal look grim.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Bad news, they found a scythe with your fingerprints on them."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I didn't say ""let's"" get rid of Juror No. 7."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,We are going to ask for the death penalty and have you remanded into your own custody.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Your attire is inappropriate for an alleged serial killer.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,It'd really help if you stopped dressing like that.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Try to maintain eye contact with the jury.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Let's tell the judge that you were only doing your job.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We're having some trouble finding impartial jurors.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think the cloak is helping you with the jury...
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Of course We'll appeal it if they give you ""Life."""
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Our only chance is a hung jury.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You really are the client from hell
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I think your Facebook profile is going to hurt us.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't feel like I am representing you in the best light.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"“I say we plea bargin for the death penalty."" - the Grim Reaper is actually the lawyer (my fave) or the other guy could be the lawyer (it's a two-for!)."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I specifically asked you not to wear a hoodie to court.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Your chances of acquittal are grim.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"No, I don't have any books on black magic."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You may prejudice the jury
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Public defenders can't afford to dress you for court.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"With any luck, the prosecutor will go for the Death penalty."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, if you've killed as many people as you say then death row is a cinch."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,You've got a bit of an image problem.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"You realize that the death penalty isn't available in civil cases, don't you?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't care who you are. I still have to execute your case.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Im not sure how to tell you this.... but they gave you death.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Oh man, you smell like... forget it."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I’m sorry. I thought you would be okay with pleading to the death penalty.
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"You're not proud, are you?"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Will you stop asking for the death penalty!
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"He's going to ask for whom the bell tolls. Whatever you do, don't answer!"
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"I know, but please just say, ""Not guilty, Your Honor."""
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Being sick of talking heads is not a defense.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,I didn't realize Hell had a law school.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"There latest deal is eternal misery in the burning fires of hell, plus life."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Is that your only suit?
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you not to wear your work clothes.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,I should warn you that everyone is trying to cheat you
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Only YOU could think the death penalty is a slap on the wrist.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"It could be worse, it could be the death sentence..."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's see if I can talk them down to accessory after the fact.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look whose calling who an ""empty suit""....."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"They're offering you life, but we can probably talk them up from there."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,You could be looking at life.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,They're sentencing you to life.
758,1,1,4,6,1.5,0.3415650255319866,517,"Now, whenever I object, I want you to give an innocent look to the jury."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Juror #4 is asking that you stop staring at her like that.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We're all requesting a continuance
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,Your request for a chess match has been denied.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,We're changing your name.
758,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,517,"I'm sorry, the best I can get you is life."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,"Worst case, they give you life."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I'm sorry to say this case is taking a grave turn.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"I think we're okay, we've got 3 Zombies on the Jury"
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,Wait - I thought I was here to defend you.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times: you reap what you sow."
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember ""just doing my job"" is not an affirmative defense."
758,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,517,I think we have to drop the self-defense plea.
758,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,517,"what do you mean anything but the ""death"" sentence ???"
1624,1,3,7,11,1.4545454545454546,0.2073046227452978,517,I completely agree. There's no way they'll recognize you without the scythe.
1624,1,3,7,11,1.4545454545454546,0.2073046227452978,517,Could you try to look less grim?
1624,0,5,6,11,1.4545454545454546,0.15745916432444337,517,We have to play the 'troubled childhood' card.
1624,1,3,7,11,1.4545454545454546,0.2073046227452978,517,"Hey man, If you had just paid your taxes, we wouldn't be here....."
1628,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,517,"With this jury, you could get life."
1628,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,517,"I would consider ""aggravated stalking"" a win."
1628,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,517,All of our witnesses are dead.
1628,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,517,It will be easier now that we succeeded in getting a separate trial for Taxes.
1628,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,517,"Clients don't usually ask me to argue for ""Death""."
1633,0,3,4,7,1.4285714285714286,0.2020305089104421,517,They're blaming you for the hung jury too.
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,"When the Prosecution asks you to take the stand, do that evil laugh thing."
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,"No, despite what you may think, a hung jury does not mean you can go back to work."
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,My strategy is to just buy us a little more time.
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,Can you get me out of this?
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,I think I can get them to take death off the table.
1633,0,3,4,7,1.4285714285714286,0.2020305089104421,517,Take my advice and don't smile at any of the jurors.
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,They found a scythe at the scene.
1633,0,3,4,7,1.4285714285714286,0.2020305089104421,517,"Understand, you're looking at life."
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,"Cheer up, you could get life."
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,It's about who you didn't kill.
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,I AM the death penalty
1633,0,3,4,7,1.4285714285714286,0.2020305089104421,517,Suppose I plead guilty to taxes.
1633,0,3,4,7,1.4285714285714286,0.2020305089104421,517,The judge believes he can try you in absentia.
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,This looks tough. Do you have any character witnesses we could call?
1633,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,517,"It's looking grim, Reaper."
1649,2,1,9,12,1.4166666666666667,0.22890825651118377,517,I think we have a pretty good shot at a mistrial. You're scaring the crap out of the jurors.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Don't let them intimidate you!
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"Worse case scenario, they give you life."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Stop looking so grim and we can win this.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Try not to look so vacuous when you testify.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I'll be brief...
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Remember, no eye contact with the jury."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"I don't think parole is an option here, buddy."
1650,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,517,The good news is if you take the stand we might end up with a hung jury.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I know its your image - but you have to ditch the hoodie!
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"I told you to lose the 'hoodie', and wear a suit."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,We're down to 7 million first degrees and 3 counts of manslaughter.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,I think we have a good shot at avoiding a life sentence.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Remember, we're trying to highlight your cuddly side"
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"To be honest, I'd be surprised if you get life."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"If any of your past is found admissible, you'll have to take a plea."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,You sure you want to enter a guilty plea...You'll be sentenced to 'Life'.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"If you're sure they won't testify against you, then don't take the deal."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Just don't touch me until after the verdict is read.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,We may be looking at life!
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,The judge doesn't see why you need to be in the witness protection program!
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Not gonna lie, Mr. Reaper. It looks grim."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Don't worry...the death penalty is off the table, the most you can get is life."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,The statute of limitations has expired on your case against Methuselah.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"Scalia? He's the one in the middle, next to Roberts."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,It's tricky--you might get the death penalty.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"Just because I wear hoodie, people assume I'm guilty."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Calling you ""He-who-must-not-be-named"" might weaken your defense."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I'd like to save you until the end.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,I don't think we should put you on the stand
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Sorry you have to go empty-handed. My client took the life sentence deal.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,File a motion to kill this next witness.
1650,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,517,It's not the hoodie itself that I'm worried about.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Pretend like you're holding an invisible baseball and the gloves won't fit.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,It would have helped if you hadn't shown up looking like death warmed over.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,I assume you're okay with the death penalty.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Can't you just hang the jury?
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"As your accountant, I told you it was inevitable."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,What are you pleading? Not guilty or not here?
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,We're going to go with an identity theft defense.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,We have to prove they weren't premeditated.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Not your actual work suit - a suit you would wear to work.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Unfortunately that's not what they mean by habeus corpus.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Well, the fact that you're already dead might work in our favor."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Bad luck; this judge is pro-life.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"This is your first offense, right?"
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Good news! He's a hanging judge!
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I really thought his time was up!
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"As your lawyer, I'm advising you not to say anything about your support for the death penalty."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Finding an unbiased jury might be a problem.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,No. The death penalty is not just a time out.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"If we're lucky...they""ll offer a death sentence"
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,You do the final argument.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"'Now look, that makes two judges, four jury members and one bailiff. I think they get your message, OK ?'"
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,It's looking pretty grim.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Just say you are self employed.
1650,0,4,6,10,1.4,0.16329931618554516,517,"As your tax attorney, I have to tell you, the outcome looks pretty certain."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I think a saffron robe would look friendlier.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I don't suppose we'll be able to find any character witnesses.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,o.k. - just try to look innocent like we practiced.
1650,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,517,"I hear you, but innocent until proven guilty just isn't going to work for us here."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,What was it you said your name was again?
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Well, we can't really deny that you did it."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"In your case, you'll receive the life penalty."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,You're not helping!
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,For the trial I said formal dress not normal!
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Remember to give the jury your killer smile.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Now's your last chance: Have you ever killed anyone before?
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"So, ummm, how do you feel about the death penalty? I would advise you to refrain from calling the death penalty, simply another day at the office."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,If only we didn't have jurors 3 and 7 ... just sayin'.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I still think a suit and tie would work better.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm going to push the rationale that a death sentence would be superfluous.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,You do realize this may mean life.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,How is it not a penalty?
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"Just a reminder, the death penalty is on the table."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Hard to find a sympathetic jury.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Try not to appear excited when they ask for capital punishment.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I told you to stop pointing at Juror #5.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Yes I think at least one juror is intimidated
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"""Don't be offended if they refer to you as an empty suit."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"You're looking at life, pal."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"I'm sorry, there is no death penalty in this state."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"Just remember, they cheated you."
1650,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,517,Concurrent or consecutive sentences: does it matter?
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Um, yes I did say wear a dark suit."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"I advise you to take the 5th, as well as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,It's a deposition...not an inquisition
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,The restraining order is for stalking.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,You'll have to dump the hoodie if you want to impress this judge.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"You promised the next time we're called in front of the Senate, I could wear it!"
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Lucky for you everyone's wearing them.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"To tell you the truth, I don't know how they would handle the death penalty in your case."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"Well, maybe if you didn't look so grim, we could get the jury on our side."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Looks like your only chance is a hung jury.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I doubt you'll get life
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"I agree, losing the scythe should help your defense"
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,I'll assume you will be seeking the death penalty.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Stop it. I’ll handle jury selection.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Would it kill you to wear a suit?
1650,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,517,They're enhancing the charge to aggravated reap.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"""sure, but I don't think self defense is on the table""."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,I'm afraid you got life.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"Don't worry, I've never lost a case on facial insufficiency."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Sorry to waste your time but we decided to go for Life without parole.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Yes, I'm sure 'absence of malice' will not be effective here!"
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,Coincidence? You've identified at every crime scene!
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"No, I don't think calling The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as character witnesses is a good idea."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Great, give them the vacant look when they ask you where you were the night of the murder."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,You'll get off no problem- I was on O.J.'s defense team.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,I'm with the I.R.S. And you are...?
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"With the number of prior convictions, I recommend you plead."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"You needn't ring your death knell every time I say ""I object""."
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,No problem. The death penalty would be double jeopardy.
1650,1,0,4,5,1.4,0.39999999999999997,517,"You're looking at 100 billion counts, but I'm pretty sure I can get the Hitler charge dropped."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"I know there's nothing wrong with a hoodie, but could you try to wear a suit when you testify?"
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,Nice to finally meet you face to hole.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"I'm not sure calling Pestilence, War and Famine as character witnesses was the best idea."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"I don't think you have to worry, they have taken the death penalty off the table."
1650,2,0,8,10,1.4,0.26666666666666666,517,Damn. It's Prima facie. Death and taxes.
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Given ALL of your priors, I have to say, it doesn't look good."
1650,0,2,3,5,1.4,0.24494897427831774,517,"Lucky for you, it's a hung jury."
1770,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,517,"If nobody turns up the scythe, you could walk."
1770,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,517,Death penalty? You’ll have to be more specific.
1770,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,517,I'll do the talking.
1770,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,517,"No, I don't think the robe makes you look ""judicial."""

1770,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,517,You couldn't have worn a suit? You just look guilty.
1770,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,517,The line up was clearly biased. The witness couldn't even see your face.
1770,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,517,"Remember, I'll do the talking."
1770,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,517,"I have to be honest, it's going to be very hard for you to get a fair trial here in Florida."
1770,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,517,"I told you, no hoodies in court."
1770,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,517,"If you'll plead out the scythe charge, I can make the rest of it go away."
1781,0,4,7,11,1.3636363636363635,0.1521200048243774,517,It looks pretty grim.

1782,1,0,5,6,1.3333333333333333,0.33333333333333337,517,The bad news is the judge supports the You Penalty.

1782,0,1,2,3,1.3333333333333333,0.408248290463863,517,I'm pretty sure that would be contempt of court.

1782,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,517,I asked you not to dress like the judge.

1782,0,2,4,6,1.3333333333333333,0.210818510677892,517,I understand--but do your best to make eye contact with the jury anyway.
1868,0,3,7,10,1.3,0.15275252316519472,517,In your case the death penalty is probably moot.
1868,1,1,8,10,1.3,0.213437474581095,517,You should plea 'guilty' and hope for the death penalty.
1868,1,1,8,10,1.3,0.213437474581095,517,I'm afraid the jury doesn't like the look of you either.
1868,0,3,7,10,1.3,0.15275252316519472,517,"""Death comes for us all"" is not a good defense."

1868,1,1,8,10,1.3,0.213437474581095,517,I thought we talked about the hoodie.

1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,The Devil made you do it? That could be a defense!
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,I'm going to try to get him to waive the death penalty but you'll have to plead guilty to aggravated assault with a sickle.
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,You didn't tell me about your record.

1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,Relax--you know you'll never serve life.
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,That's not exactly what I had in mind when I said to wear a killer outfit.
1874,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,517,There may be some lingering resentment.
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,I think it's best you don't testify.
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,"Why yes, I do see you getting life without parole as being rather ironic"
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,The death penalty is the least of your worries.
1874,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,517,They want to impose the Life Penalty.
1874,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,517,Stick to the story. You are personally opposed to the death penalty.
1874,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,517,How ironic - they're asking for the death penalty.
1874,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,517,My last lawyer seemed more optimistic!
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,"Now, let me get this straight ... you prefer to settle out of court and bargain with the devil?"

1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,As your attorney I have to advise you against telling each member of the court the date of their demise.
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,"No, punishable by death does not mean you get to pick your own sentence."
1874,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,517,You look surprised..

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I need you to say you feared for your safety.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The trial ahead is looking Grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember to tell the truth but don't bring up that death stuff
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad idea telling the jury ‘All will come to me in the end’
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, no habeas corpus without a corpus."

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,To gain the jury's sympathy I advise you to be not proud.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think you can plea bargain for the death penalty
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You want the death penalty? This is tax court.

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought we agreed that you were going to wear a suit today.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They've offered you a great plea--I think you'll really reap the benefits.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,'Their time was up' is not a good defense.

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They're calling a fingerprint expert for the scythe.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you want people to believe you're innocent, the hoodie has to go."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You must have misunderstood. I said I am deadly in court.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you to wear the blue cloak.

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's just say it looks suspicious when their witnesses keep dying.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You won't have a chance if you sit thru the trial just looking so guilty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's put you on the stand and hope for a hung jury.

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""God made me do it!"" is not a defense that's ever worked before."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Like I said, this outcome is not dead certain."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,If you didn't kill him then who did?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It looks like a hung jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, you can't claim Habeas Corpses."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Will you be involved with jury selection?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Take it easy. We have a good I.D. defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, but there's no statute of limitations on murder."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think taking the fifth is going to do it.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just think of it this way, a life time career doing what you love."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What game of chess?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How could you not know you had to pay taxes?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember to let the jurors see your loveable side.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""Profiling"" will not be an adequate defense in this case."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,He said it's looking pretty grim for you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, I’d say it DOES look bad for you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's talk about your body language.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Is there anything missing from your testimony?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"OK, I get you 30 years and you give me 30 years and we'll call it even."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,My top priority is making sure you don't get the you penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Now that denial and anger are out of the way, they should be ready to bargain."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No eyewitnesses, but you still don't look innocent to the jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry--there's no life penalty in this state.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How do you want to plead?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Any potential character witnesses?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's not the hoodie that worries me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I have repeatedly said there is no dress code here!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try to look likable for the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your check bounced
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Worst case scenario, you get a life sentence."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,A concrete metaphor comes to mind....
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Can you arrange for a hung jury?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Levitate to the stand and show the jury that you're not just another ass in a costume.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Thank god, any mention of Death penalty is off the table."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ok, my case is that unless they can come up with the scythe, there's reasonable doubt"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How did you manage not to escape detection?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's not mention your regular job.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think the second amendment covers your scythe
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We're seeking the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How are you not in jail yet?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know you're an expert witness, but this is a TAX case."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Your moral objections to the death penalty are surprising, but duly noted."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Keep your mouth shut.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Fortunately, this State does not carry the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, sir, but I don't own a blue tie."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Take the plea bargain. Trust me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to look so grim.

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What made you think the sickle would get through security?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, no . . . _you're_ going to be executed."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, the scythe was next to the body when you arrived."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The prosecution has agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Worst case scenario, you'll be sentenced to life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't look so grim, you reap what you sow!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Listen, Leroy. Quoting the Unabomber is not helping your case."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Can we try jury selection my way?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember to smile and make eye contact with the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ya. I just think scythe or no scythe, you're doomed."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, you could accept the plea deal to become a Life Coach in Canada."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Stop pointing at the jury and telling them that one day you will be coming for them.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They can't acquit, the hood actually fits"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,No. No. No. ...No Darth Vader defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Any chance for parole?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Good news. The jury is deadlocked.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Deal. Pro bono, pro life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I say, cop a plea and go for Eternity with chance of parole."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It was inevitable that one day you'd be sued for censoring someone's Facebook post.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I advise that you don't take the stand.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We're hoping for a hung jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Death is different.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Lots of guys look like me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm gonna recommend the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, they can't accuse you of being a two faced liar."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I though I was off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Trust me; loose the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, you can't be judge, jury, and executioner."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I understand you are cold, but a sweater would have been a better choice."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yeah, I said you don't have to testify, but you do have to appear."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What's with the outfit? Do you have a death wish?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This issue has been briefed to death.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Did anyone see you in Samarra?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Good news, you're eligible for the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Strange how we keep getting hung jurors.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm going for taking the death penalty off the table. We've got a good chance with 'time served'.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Maybe dress more liberally for the sentencing hearing.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I really don't think we should use Satan as a witness.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're missing all of your 1099-DIE forms.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's tough, defending a serial killer."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Couldn't get a jury of your peers . The morgue was empty
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The DA nixed the chess match deal.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm dying to hear the verdict too
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm glad you ditched the scythe, but couldn't you have worn a suit?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's important the jury doesn't know where you're coming from.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We've got em.....with double jeopardy.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What do you mean this IS your most professional look?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Well you knew what they say about death and taxes...
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you get me off, I will guarantee you a cushy afterlife!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They've agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,But the scythe does fit.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you are not that street artist, take off that hood and prove it."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought we talked about wearing a hoodie to court...
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think we convinced then it was justifiable homicide.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Going with reasonable doubt. You good with reasonable doubt?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll need a review of all 50 thousand pages.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, it would be ironic if you got the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You have no peers.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you should have gone with a navy blazer.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Okay, when the new judge arrives, please let me do all the objecting and pointing of fingers."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"All in all, your chances are pretty good...considering they didn't find a sicle."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,A guilty plea will get you life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,At this time the defense rests.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We can't lose. You're eternal.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Geez, are you that afraid to face the jury!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's hard to put a good face on this.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think I'd like a new tax attorney
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I say we go for heaven
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We could argue they were at your door.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let me tell you about my repeat customer discount.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should probably consider actually letting this jury live.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"May I call you Grim, Mr. Reaper?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,No magistrate in the country will convict you—you were just supervising.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Hung jury is supposed to be a metaphor.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You'd be dead if it weren't for me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,At least you don't have to worry about getting the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,No you won't testify. They will have to take things at face value.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think the best option is to plead guilty and ask for the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I think you should be quiet and take the deal, if convicted you will get natural life plus ten years, that could be an eternity in your case!!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know, I know, Death waits for no man. But we gotta break for lunch at some point."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury would see right through you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If we lose this case, can you at least wait 20 years before you come for me?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The presiding judge is pro-life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I contacted your list of character witnesses, but they all said ""Go to hell!"""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Even if they drop the charges you could still face a wrongful death suit in civil court.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry. If they don't dismiss the class-action after these hearings, we're simply going to ask for some class members to appear in person."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry - the death penalty is still on the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just try not to look guilty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When I took your case I said be transparent, not invisible!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So you have no objections to an insanity defense?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This IS what I wear to work.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You know, a suit and tie would have made a better impression."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know you have been doing this job for eternity but as I told you before, “I was just doing my job” is not a defense the jury is going to buy."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You Honor, I've told him a hundred times that this is pro bono, but he keeps insisting that someone is going to pay for all this."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, it seems you have some priors....."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sorry -- they never found your body.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Take the deal. It's only two days in heaven.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we're in trouble. They're going to call Taxes to the stand.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The sentence might be life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm told the DA really wants to win this one.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, not going well...not well at all."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll ask for separate trials on each count.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Stop looking at the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You got this. They're all afraid of you. Everybody in the room is afraid of you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This case is going to kill me
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge thinks you're a freight risk.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, all they have on you is loitering."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should be happy the death penalty is off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"His early death was a simple case of mistaken identity. Occupational hazard, right?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to look so smug.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yea, it will be a hung jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I have good news. The worst punishment going to hell.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Well at least I can help you save face.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you want the jury's sympathy, try no to look so grim."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's a capital case! You might have to 'do' yourself, mister I'm so tough!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You want how many other offences taken into consideration?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I get it, believe me, 25 to life is ironic."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Have you signed a book deal yet?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You're fired, Counselor, I need a fresh face."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You will need to explain why the death rate is still one each.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suggest you plead the Fifth Circle of Hell.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought we said less ghastly.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,She wants to keep the house.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How come the Judge never overrules YOUR objections?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're dead to me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm basing your defense on no proof of intent.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The scythe didn't fit.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,My scythe couldn't get through security.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, we can't ask for the death penalty"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When I said we wanted a hung jury, I didn't mean it literally."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Before I start I have one last question. What happens to me if I lose?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's working. You're scaring the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If we lose, you get life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"What do you care how I dress, I'm doing the case pro bono!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We could use the death penalty as a loop hole.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just between you and me . . . did you do it?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, not a word about the chess match."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'd can't stay and handle your case because I've got an appointment in Samarra.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I said you may take the fifth not Judge Fitch.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember - during cross-examination, stay grim."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,it's because everyone does agree that you 'just kill' in that hoodie
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, if I win this case, you'll pay a visit to the senior partners?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"What do you mean, you never lose?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think smiling at the jury is helping our case
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We probably should have plead out.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They're calling it a wrongful death.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Life without parole. I wish I had better news.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We can beat this.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"We might be over playing the ""pain and suffering"" bit ..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think 'it's inevitable' is a winning defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Good news. One of the jurors is an undertaker.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When I said you should hide your head in shame, I didn't expect you would take it literally."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I recommend you take the plea bargain
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll use your internet entrepreneur status in the character defense.
1909,1,1,10,12,1.25,0.17943514064131835,517,Let's challenge Juror number four. Her grandma died recently.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You're in luck, they're seeking the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Request a death sentence?Clever.
1909,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,517,This jury will not sympathize with 'a downtrodden black man in white gloves.'
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just remember, you might be facing death...but so is the judge when he talks to you..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm already on the dark side
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your situation looks grim but I'm guessing you're used to it.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Wrongful death is really not a good way to boost your numbers
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's not meant as an insult. Around here death IS a penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm glad you came, I didn't have a shot in this case."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What's wrong with my tie?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, at least we can be assured that Capital Punishment is off the table."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Will you be picking the jury or shall I?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Whatever you do, don't bring out your scythe."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Maybe we should settle out of court.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don’t do anything that might turn the jury against you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"All things considered, LIFE without parole is pretty generous."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What do you mean by natural causes?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We might have some trouble explaining the scythe found at the scene of the crime.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,in Under no circumstances do I want you to look directly at the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think a change of venue would do you much good.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They found the scythe, but there weren't any prints."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sure you do indeed find it comical to be told by the judge that your case looks grim - but I really do need you to focus right now.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They're not going to care if it's your job, it's still tampering."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to show any emotion.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This is a murder case. You need to show more emotion.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Please don't take this the wrong way, but I feel that your representation in my death penalty case is not in my best interest. I am going to ask for a new lawyer."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It would help your case if you smiled!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Have a snickers when court recesses...you're not you when your hungry.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't like where this is headed. What do you think?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Whatever you do, don't look up."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll open with Dante.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"As your lawyer, I'm advising you, don't take the stand. Didn't you see the OJ movie?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Because you're a family friend I'll do it pro bono
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Gotta say, these are the most amicable divorce proceedings I've witnessed!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'd say your case has all kinds of holes in it.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,He's offering you life.....I'd take it.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If we lose this, the judge'll recommend the life penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Good work. They’re looking for a scythe instead of a 38.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I won't tell the judge her time is almost up."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Their case is strong. Brace yourself: You may get life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Relax. No jury would dare find you guilty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So getting you a Life sentence would be a good thing.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's all good. Ted Cruz is going to come in and sit next to you so you won't look so creepy.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. Everyone knows you are certain.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury room is off limits. Eat you lunch at recess in the hall.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Given your history, citing diminished responsibility might not be the best way forward."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Bad news, the prosecution is asking for a life sentence."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Help me. I do not approve of capital punishment.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How would you feel about a sentence of life without parole?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, it's called a ""wrongful death"" case, but could you try to take it a little less personally?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you and I have a different definition of hung jury
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm sorry Mr. Reaper, ""You were just doing your job"" is not a defense we can win with."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, I'm certain that these are my taxes...why?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How do we plead if everything you say is a lie?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The optics aren't working in your favor.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"First thing, lose the hoodie."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,At least we don't need to worry about the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I told you, lose the hoodie."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"In my estimation, it's unlikely you'll get life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I swear I have New York values and I didn't vote for Cruze
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Please....no more jokes about a 'hung jury'.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just because that particular sentence is named after you doesn't mean we're doomed from the start.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"In the event that it's even possible, be sure to never make eye contact with any juror."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, I know you're usually the penalty, but you've angered the wrong people this time."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"All things considered, I'd advise you not to testify."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think they'll push for the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I think you lost the jury when you ended with ""Have a nice day."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Can we get Scalia back, just until November?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's not looking good, is it?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, am I defending you as the Grim Reaper or the Grim Rapper?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The whole ""'till death do us part"" thing didn't seem to work so well for us this time."

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Hopefully you can get credit for time served.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Really, what you do is indefensible, but I'll try."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know it hurts your brand, but we should consider the manslaughter plea."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The outcome looks grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's a hung jury...literally.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you business casual!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I say its worth the risk. If the Scythe is too short, they can't possibly convict you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"All I'm saying is that the hoodie looks menacing, Karl. Would it have killed you to put on a suit like I asked?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Our case looks grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The Jury finds the defendant, Death, guilty of the murder of 93 billion people."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They would like to know where you were between 1665 and 1666.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,That's not really a fitting punishment for jay walking.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Ironic. They're seeking the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""Yes ironically a ""hung jury "" would be in our favor."
1909,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,517,"The offer is""Death without the possibility of parole""."

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,But it just isn't happening at the other campaign rallies.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Best case scenario; you'll get life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You can't give up now. My wife just took out a million-dollar life insurance policy.

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just let me do all the talking.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yeah, but they'll kill you on cross."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Somehow I don't think this is the best way to avoid suspicion, governor."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge said that feeling hollow inside is not an adequate defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"What do you mean, ""they can't identify me because I'm faceless"", that's HOW they identified you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,My shrink tells me that they are naming the new syndrome after me!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Contrary to your objections, I still intend to argue for life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, we want the jury to like you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They're obviously going to have a tough time implementing capital punishment without your cooperation, but there's no getting around the fact that you really have taken a lot of lives."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news. They're going for the life sentence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So you're saying I could get life for this?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't look any juror in the eye. And it would help if you could be a little less grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, it's not a hoodie, it's an expression of your religious freedom."

1909,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,517,Just try to look innocent.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Can you work work with me here? I'm not asking for tears, but we're doomed unless you can come up with a contrite expression."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""Self-defence"" may be a very tough sell."
1909,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,517,"OK, usually it's good to make eye contact with the jurors.............."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You would be too grim on the stand.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm thinking the death penalty would be win-win.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,...and if I loose your case?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,A death sentence will not change your life in any way.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Normally, I'd counsel you to take the life sentence offered. But it does not become you."

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Look kindly.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sorry—it looks like a life sentence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,That's not exactly the dark suit I had in mind for you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You'd rather get the death penalty and not a life sentence?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,death becomes you but let's not rush it.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You can take that off now. They 've taken the death penalty off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The whistleblower defense might have worked...but that was before you went and killed Scalia.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I always knew this job would kill me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I recommend you plead the fifth.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They think that you should have had the foresight to not look in the rear view mirror.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, he is known as ""The Hanging Judge""."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It looks like you are going to have pay those taxes
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just sign on the line and I'm fully insured?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's a you penalty case.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This must be serious. You sent a partner instead of an associate.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm dying to hear the verdict.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Inevitability is not a defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The judge won't accept the ""trying to find yourself"" defense."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When you're on the stand, try to look affable and fun-loving."

1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you're being a little overdramatic—it's just a parking ticket.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,If you want to win this thing please be not proud.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Face it. The verdict may be grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your prospects of winning are grim....unless it's a hung jury
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury will like you better if you wear a suit and tie
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think they can produce any witnesses.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"And then you say, ""Tobacco? What's that?"""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, you actually weren't wearing a hoodie that night?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You better let me do the talking.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ok, we're going to introduce you as an 'expert witness' in your field...."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Maybe if you pull the hood back you'll appear less demonic to the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,My client would like to plead not guilty by reason of nihilism.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, you can't reap a hung jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The ruling is final; you will be replaced by 2017
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Tomorrow, wear a suit."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Let's not kid ourselves, the IRS is a tough opponent."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I hope we get a liberal jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,My objection was overruled. Your turn.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look Mr. Reaper, we can't just keep using the old ""it's my job"" defense..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You WANT the death sentence?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So you thought he said ""today"" rather than ""not today""?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,''You need to wipe the smile off your face.''
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I don't know, I've never asked for the death sentence before."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I can't promise that you won't get life
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The prosecution is going for eternal damnation but I'll plead it down to being a super delegate at the Republican convention.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I don't think using the untimely death of Mildred Potter as an alibi will help your case."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Some bad news, your alibi is alive."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If we get an acquittal, you will have cheated, well, yourself."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"This time, don't hang the jury until after they announce the verdict."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try to look remorseful.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"As your lawyer, I recommend the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I already told you. I couldn't find any character witnesses."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, we've got a jury to die for."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember your in the witness protection program. Don't give your real name.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The devil made me do it!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What happens if the sentence is life imprisonment?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They found the scythe.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You've got nothing to worry about---this state doesn't have a Death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'll try my best, but that's a load of parking tickets."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Once again, that you only hired the hit man is not a viable defense."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"For the last time, pleading ""death sentence"" is not an option!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,OK. Check that. Maybe don't look the jury in the eye.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,they will ask you to state your full name for the record
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When I get close to you, I can hear the ocean."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What did you say would happen if I don't get a reduction in your alimony?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, witness protection can be withdrawn at the judge's discretion..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Though in your case, 'life' might be a good thing."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just so we're clear — in this room, you leave the soul-sucking to me."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know you're facing the death penalty, but in your case I think we can risk a jury trial."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ask the judge if you can approach, maybe it'll sway him."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So as you can see, your Honor, my client, who shall remain faceless, could not have been at the scene of the crime."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You do know ""kill me now"" is just a figure of speech, right?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Do you have your voter I.D. card with you?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I can't believe the outcome of this case is a life or death matter for you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You know, this whole case hinges on the jury being able to see what you're really made of."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't say anything about your plans for tonight.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll stipulate your scythe is a deadly weapon.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Absolutely not! No threats to the prosecutor.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""I was just doing my job"" is not going to be a winning defense."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think I can get you eternity without parole.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, but I usually don't recommend the death penalty for petty theft."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"In a word, grim."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry... I have a Plan B.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't look so grim. I'm sure I can get you off with just the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This may be a rough go. The judge is pro-life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,If only we could stop the next witness from testifying.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Be sure to make eye contact with the jurors.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"According to my file, the prosecution rests tomorrow."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm going to try and get the death penalty off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Wear a tie, take the fifth."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I assume avoiding the death penalty isn't a priority.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury's here... look innocent.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"By the way, I really wouldn't mind if you chose to go ""pro se."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,ECHO ... Echo ... echo ...
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm here for you. This is Texas!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, ""The pending legislation does NOT create death panels."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I though we agree you would smile
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The death penalty is not usually considered a reward here.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to give the jury a blank stare.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should take life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I hate to tell you this, but you don't have a ""chance in hell""of being acquitted."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It seems counter-intuitive but a death sentence is not actually in your favor.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I don't think I can sell the jury on, ""Come on baby(Don't fear the reaper.)"""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Would it have killed you to wear a coat and tie?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Please stop referring to it as the ""you penalty""."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll plea-bargain for death.
1909,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,517,Wear gloves when you place your hand on the bible.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Really ? This again. I told you I am not going to call you Mr. Grim Reaper. Just Mr. Reaper. It works better with juries and I think is just sounds more professional.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, this crime doesn't qualify for a death sentence."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Off the record, does that come in a pinstripe?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The recess is just until your face grows back.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I’m pretty sure we can’t ask for the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge wants to know what your reaction to a death penalty would be?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry. No body, no habeus corpus."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, senatorial confirmation is scary but I still think you should give them your name."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Soon you will be free to show your face.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought we agreed on a navy suit.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just don't make eye contact with the jurors.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Unfortunately, I'm having trouble getting in touch with your alibi."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What about juror no. 666?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Juror number seven? Tonight? Wow, what are the odds?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This is a civil case. We can only ask for monetary damages.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Do not pull out the scythe when you're being cross-examined.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You have a right to remain silent.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Not to worry. Your face doesn't show up on any of the security cameras.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Being dead is usually a good alibi.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No. They're not sentencing you to ""just be yourself."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"And don't forget, whatever you do don't look the jury in the eye."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, Death, the hoodie’s not helping your case here."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember to look the jury in the eye.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,That necktie makes you look too sinister.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You couldn't find a nice suit and button down shirt to wear?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think the jury would buy that you lost your head.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mr. Reaper, there is still the outstanding issue of your bill."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The verbal contract does state ""til death do us part""."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, but the irony of your getting the death penalty would be amazing."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"We all have a job to do,"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you to get a new suit !
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Relax! There's no way they'll be able to make a positive ID.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we should cop a plea and hope for the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You may want to lose the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Now try to look cheerful.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, you say you were at your club playing squash."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we'll go with the 'I was just doing my job' defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Yes. Definitely no witnesses.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's admissible as a dying declaration
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If a jury can find O.J. innocent, I'm sure you'll be fine."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Jury selection is not going well.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Their case is kaput once the DA's witness has to ID you!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember Eye Contact
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's a slam dunk. This state has no death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's opt for the death penalty. It'll give us grounds for appeal.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We're going to plead insanity.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"What exactly do you mean, ""bored to death""?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The it's-my-job defense has no legal precedent."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Fortunately, the death penalty is off the table."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're losing face!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, things look grim."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The best I can get you is life without parole.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's better for our case that you agreed to leave the scythe at home.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm sure the prosecution will not go for the death penalty, it would be redundant."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Cheer up-- the death penalty is off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"That's not exactly what 'hung jury' means, but I still think it's our best chance."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,From one lawyer to another.....
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm feeling sort of grim about the verdict.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Say what you always say. Tell them exactly what happens.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're my legal aid attorney?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It might work to your benefit if we say you own a startup company.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You understand that life is not an option, in prison or anywhere else."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're not-guilty-self is going to be much more helpful here.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This judge is reasonable. I think we can plea bargain the charges from 110 billion counts down to 80 billion or so...
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm going to win this case if it's the last thing I do.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I am worried about the way you are dressed before a conservative judge. He normally rules against men wearing nail polish.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Lucky for you, we don't have the death penalty here."
1909,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,517,"If you cooperate, they'll take you off the table."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"We need the jury on your side. Relax, smile, and stop killing them."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I want to win one of these before I die.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's very important - for both of us- you learn to pronounce ""mesothelioma."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I do not think you have one of those faces people trust."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The IRS will never collect- its either Death OR taxes.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"To this jury, you're not death incarnate, you're just a white guy with a hoodie - you'll be fine."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry about it. They can't even spell ""scythe""."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If they give you a life sentence, try not to laugh."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I get it, 'Death and Taxes'!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We plan to appeal on the grounds that you cannot be sentenced to yourself.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Darn it, I really shouldn't have jaywalked."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You may be a good teacher, but you still killed all your students."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You call that your smile?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You know on the stand, you'll have to bare your soul"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Have you got a nice suit? This is a tough jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Eventually, you know, they'll want to de-pose you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It helps that you're active in the community.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,He wants a stay of execution.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, the worst you can get is death."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Please stop pointing at the jurors.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Gassed or electrocuted ?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It doesn't look good. Instead of the death penalty, they're offering life in prison."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I've got to be honest...your case is looking grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They don't take kindly to hoodies in the courtroom.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I guess you don't have a problem with the Death Penalty here.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,OK. So you'll take the Fifth.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Their facial-recognition evidence is pretty thin.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yeah, it's the truth, but saying ""No one here gets out alive"" does nothing for your defence."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your chances look grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Are you sure you're disclosing everything?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,ALL of them?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"She wants the scythe, too."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I really don't think the chair is such a bad result.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm thinking hung jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Look straight ahead and don't worry about any eyewitnesses.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, our relationship is strictly privileged and confidential. But after this is over I expect to never, ever see you again."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I know that is the name you prefer and have always gone by but I feel it prejudices the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm not worried if YOU get the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They call me the Grim Briefer.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The cloak is not helping your case.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You don't have much color and a neck tie would have been nice
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No fingerprints on the sickle, right?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Now they've got some character witness who says you hustled him at chess.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They can't see past the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"O.K!, O.K!, pro bono it is."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your mouthwash ain't cuttin it!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Not sure they'll think the death penalty plea will make it even.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The ""Force"" is with you..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Hung jury, not hanged jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,No witness. No DNA. No case!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,And please stop telling me things are looking grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Keep your mouth shut, that hood up and let me do the talking"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You will need to convince the jury that you're sorry and will never do it again.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I should have mentioned my fees earlier--$500 an hour, and eternal life. And I get the scythe if we win."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Dave, I think this is the right moment to tell you that I've been having an affair with your wife. But I'm going to have to fire you again."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,At least you won't need to worry about the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What do you mean you don't believe in the death penalty?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The court won't accept the name ""Grim Reaper."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm telling you, you have to face the facts."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Then again, maybe we should have stuck with the jumpsuit."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,There's no getting around this. You're going to have to put your hand on the Bible.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So I think we stay with the hood. Yes, the judge hates it, but juror number 3 keeps smiling at you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I keep telling you . . . the prosecution has six nuns who saw you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Trust me! If the court can turn a corporation into a person, it can turn you into one, too."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Does my elbow touching your elbow count as me being dead?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'd say your prospects look grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Death Penalty? Really?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ok, I got them to take the You Penalty off the table."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'd actually recommend not making eye contact.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm not sure that a plea of ""not guilty"" is your best bet."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Unfortunately, they abolished the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Now, when you ask if the death penalty is an option, how exactly do you mean that?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's going to be hard to get a fair jury in Miami
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know you are homesick, but you can't get the death penalty for speeding!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You are lucky. Death has not been outlawed in this state.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Wouldn't you rather take the penalty that's named after you?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Let me guess, you never settle either."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, one thing's for certain, there's no possibility of a death penalty verdict"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just remember, you're the one who was cheated."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I thought we agreed on sweater vest with button down and tie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we should ask for life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Your Honor, Death pleads Guilty to tax evasion."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Well at least death is off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,At least the death penalty is off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I told you three times, the DA won't agree to the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""Cross my heart and hope to die"" isn't going to cut it."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's not looking good. Throw a kiss to Juror #6.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I know you don't do bargains but would you make an exception for this plea?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We've only a ghost of a chance.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Of course, you are aware of the what the maximum penalty would be."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your case isn't as grim as it looks.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think the scythe is what killed us.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, I can buy you some time, but you're gonna have to pay those back taxes."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you this job was soul-sucking.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think we have to worry about the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Did you have to wear that?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When the plaintiff takes the stand, try to avoid eye contact."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, I know what happens if we lose."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I will not let you speak in your own defense, Mr Reaper."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ok. Now, remember. The key is to make sure you don't get life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think I can get the judge to agree to a 10-to-life sentence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Change of venue? To where?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"But really, would the death sentence be so bad?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It doesn't look good but at least there's no death penalty in this state.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,In your case the death penalty is beyond ironic.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's just that the hood has sort of a connotation.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Your scythe may only be symbolic, but it is admissible."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I asked you not to wear your hoodie to court.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, we're not in Silicon Valley. Here you look like the Unabomber."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suggest we plead diminished reaponsibility.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No Mr. Reaper ,with your record a deadlocked jury is highly unlikely ."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"By the way, I wouldn't mention anything about that large scythe of yours..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Trust me, nolo contendere in civil court."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. The life penalty is not legal in this state.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Nothing is certain in tax cases.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Your case is looking grim, Mr. Reaper"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Stop staring at the jury -- there are no more alternates.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Thanks for your vote of confidence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Something tells me you know which way the jury is leaning.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"In this case, the death penalty is not a good thing."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So you think self defense is the best way to go here?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No matter how many souls you've already taken-- deny, deny, deny, & plead ""not guilty."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, it's better than yesterday's SS uniform."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, we have to let the jury see the real you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No....""Death Penalty"" isn't an insult."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think I can get it down to manslaughter.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Okay, so remember to smile at the jury"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Try to look earnest, but not too earnest."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Gee Rob, I'm glad it's not your sense of humor that's on trial here."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,That would be a *hanged* jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, 'Habeas Corpus' is Latin for ""you shall have the body,"" but they don't mean it literally."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't mention your occupation.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just take it as face value! I think we can win this case.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't look so grim! Reap trials almost always come down to he said, she said."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Wait. You want me to ask FOR the death sentence?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This should be a breeze - all my other clients are faceless corporations...
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suggest an Alford plea.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Naw, trust me on this one - let's leave your sickle in the car."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll try to get the death penalty off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know you feel cheated, but demanding the death penalty in this case is, frankly, absurd."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You cannot ask for the death penalty for your traffic citation.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, so these claims go all the way back to the beginning of time; it turns out there is no statute of limitations for what you did."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They want to know where your body's buried.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Consider yourself dead
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"In my youth ""The Invisible Man "" was wrapped in bandages!!!!!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suggest you take the Fifth.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,She'll return your scythe in exchange for her The Walking Dead DVDs.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you don't testify, you might get the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I wont lie to you..things look pretty grim. Do you have something else you could wear to court?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Well..do I even have time to finish this brief?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge thinks it is a hollow argument
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You didn't do yourself any favors with that cologne.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Looks like you're getting You
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They can't touch you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mr. Death, as expected, they're asking for the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They're going to push for the you sentence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm sorry, but it seems that you are still liable despite being dead."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's just like we practiced: ""Not that I recall."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Why so grim? They gave you life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't know if the death sentence is viable in Judge Judy.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, I understand that a life sentence is not your first choice."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"In your case, capital punishment may not apply"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Reaper, you can have your scythe back after court."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Death penalty. Didn't see that one coming'.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If it's any consolation, I believe you're innocent."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When I put you on the stand, just don't look at the jurors."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm certain taxes will be here.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I don't care what you have on your business cards, for this trial you will be known as Billy Reaper."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I may have to tell you something GRIM.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you are a little premature.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You can't convict what you can't see . Worth a try.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we can avoid the death penalty if you promise not to do it again.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Reaper has an eco-feel to it, but the grim as got to go."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, it's a no win situation here. She picked you out of a lineup. Plead guilty or go to trial....either way, we're all dead!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Just to make sure I understand you, are you hoping the jury reached a Death Penalty verdict?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"When you take the stand, tell them how the whole thing left you mortified."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"In this case, the death penalty is basically just house arrest."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Fortunately, they weren't able to lift any fingerprints off the scythe."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Trust me: You'll kill up there.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Of course I believe you
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suggest a little fire and brimstone in your closing remarks.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You probably could've gotten away with it if you didn't post those photos on Instagram.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We discussed this. You're not testifying.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Tell me... are you absolutely certain?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, you do not get to 'help with the hangings' if it's a hung jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I've researched your case thoroughly and find that I can no longer defend your actions.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Quit putting the death penalty back on this table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,When you ID the perpetrator it'd be best not to point.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"What do you mean, you always win?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So how do you feel about the color orange?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, there is a chance that it'll be a hung jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"And remember, I've never had a client with a rap like yours."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You may get life for killing that chess player.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You could've at least put on a tie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,At least there's no death penalty!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,next time leave a witness
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm worried that the prosecution will be asking for the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It would really help if you lost the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It is going to be easier if you confess.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They're having trouble finding a jury of your peers.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you to wear the blue suit.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'll go after her on Benghazi and the emails. If that doesn't work, you're up."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Death was the best I could do but I thought you'd be ok with that.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Relax, you had to leave your scythe at the metal detector. Now, you're just a random guy in a hoodie."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you plead guilty, they'll drop the death sentence."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think you will be getting a jury of your peers.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, I guess the death penalty is off the table."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Frankly, you've got the face of a killer."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm the lawyer. I make the closing statement.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I said it was best to look grim during a homicide defense, not look like the grim reaper."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. You won't get life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"We've discussed this already, that would be considered Jury tampering."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to touch anyone else on the way to the stand.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Five 99-year sentences, running consecutively, sounds harsh, but I doubt you're in more than 70 years tops."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,it's not looking good...
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I WANT A DIFFERENT LAWYER.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This is not what I meant when I said I needed a dramatic closing.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Apparently you can't stand your ground with a scythe.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you that black hoodies don't play well with juries.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Stop snickering. The death penalty is a real thing.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Worse case scenario, it won't be cruel and unusual for you."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I hope you don't think I'm doing this pro bono just to get on your good side?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Keep in mind: O.J. was acquitted.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Bad news, they gave you Life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So we're going to challenge eyewitness identification?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You of all people should have known that taxes are inevitable!
1909,1,1,10,12,1.25,0.17943514064131835,517,I hear the jury is pro-life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, at least we know the prosecution wont't seek the death penalty..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,No... I'm afraid it's life... without parole!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,try to look on the bright side
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll argue the death penalty is a conflict of interest.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Anything you say may be used against you in the afterlife.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They're willing to take the death penalty off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,And don't bring up 'death panels' again.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Lets face it, no pun intended, things look grim Mr. Reaper."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You got anything in there that could pass for charm? The jury hates you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Why are you always so grim about everything??
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, he was already dead when you got there."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's the state that asks for the death penalty, not the defense."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news - they're offering life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It doesn't really matter, right?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,A hoodie! Couldn't you wear something else?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,As an expert witness try smiling less.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I don't think carrying out the death penalty will be part of your community service."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Nobody's ever tried to plea-bargain for the death penalty!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should be happy the charges were reduced to manslaughter.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should be more worried about the tax evasion charge.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Duck? No, I ordered chicken."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This really seems like Double Jeopardy.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's stay real here - And that means no more 'ghost-of-a-chance' opinions.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How do you feel about capital punishment?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're sure you're not guilty?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Since this is your first trial for the firm, I will tell you when to go for the kill."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sorry the verdict didn't allow you to save face.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, we can plea down to misdemeanor possession of a scythe, but I can't do anything about the murder charges."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The eye witness could be a problem.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Leave the objections to me, ok?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I got you a backstage pass to the Justin Bieber concert.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're looking at the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""It will go better if you don't say ""over your dead body"" to the judge again."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The average age of the jury is 85. What do YOU think the chance of your getting a favorable verdict are?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They'll have a hard time convicting without a scythe.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I think we should be focusing on bigger issues, but the answer to your question is ‘yes’ – if you're cleared of all charges, they will very likely return your scythe."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How many billable hours do I have left?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I say we ask for the death sentence, with time off for good behavior."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. The numbers are on your side.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry if we lose. They keep calling it a penalty but it'll feel more like a slap on the wrist.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm not sure that your claim that you are the Grim Reaper is going to clear you of a murder one charge.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, it would appear that there is a third certainty when you wear a hoodie on the streets of America"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Let me be clear about this...even if I lose this case, I still retain possession of my soul"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Seriously, let me do the talking. No one has ever beaten Death."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Good news! Their eye witness testimony might be a problem.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I saw this coming."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, there's no death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You couldn't have worn a suit?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Fortunately the judge has a macabre sense of humor.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, evenen though you're Death, you still can't escape taxes..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They can't find the bodies you buried, but they've got you on tax evasion."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"First off, I'll only refer to you as 'Mr. Grim.'"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I advise you to plea, ""Let me be me."""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""Maybe you shouldn't wear that on the witness stand."" '"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Unless you're thinking of penalizing yourself, they're bluffing."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Fidel who?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Unfortunately, this is not a death penalty state."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm sorry, looks like it's going to be the life penalty..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I knew the public defender would be the death of me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You could get life. It's unfortunate, but you have to appreciate the irony"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"you'd have to admit, these cases are becoming more grim"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think I can get you off. But we can avoid the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we can plea bargain for the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I can't touch that Bible. You know that, right?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Keep a poker face, the jury will be watching."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm not sure ""he was at peace with it"" is our best defense."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So, you are telling me that the death penalty would be a complement?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Now you'll have to show a face to the case.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news--you got the death penalty. Good news--that's a conflict of interest.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If all else fails, challenge the Judge to a game of chess."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I guess we don't have to worry about the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Please, please, please, if he mentions ""The Death Sentence,"" try not to laugh."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, I'm a tax attorney."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We'll just tell them you have a great track record filing habeus corpus.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. Reaping is totally legal.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Wait, I'M just an empty suit?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,so tell me about your depression
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We'd be in better shape if you hadn't taken Scalia.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Between you and me, it's hard defending someone who brings a scythe into the courtroom..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"All things considered, 30 years isn't so bad."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Why strike him? Seriously, ""Angel"" isn't that uncommon of a name in this community."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm death. That's what you want nme to go with?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Are you still there?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury sent out a note asking what the death penalty would mean in your case.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, yeah, I probably could get a plea deal for manslaughter. But with tens of billions of counts, the sentence would still be quite a kick in the pants."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The Prosecutor is asking for a life sentence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,That's what you're wearing? Work with me here.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember. You have the right to remain silent.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, ""It was their time"" is not a valid defense."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So we'll ask for clemency. They've got you dead to rights on that shell game business.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Did you just call me an 'empty suit'?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Taxes? Are you certain?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's not your fault, she was a heavy sleeper."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"What do you mean, you were framed ?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They want to know if Grim Reaper is an alias?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know it's ironic, but they're giving you life."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, I suppose the death penalty would be redundant."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Do you appreciate the irony of my plea bargaining in exchange for 'life'?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Yes, it does look different from this side of the table Mr. Scalia."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They don't understand that you would welcome the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's about the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm afraid your DNA results are not encouraging.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"He said up the river, not across the river."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm not saying it's you, but the whole jury died on sentencing day."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you to dress for court!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The best you can hope for is 20 years to death.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This is a big thrill for me. I usually handle taxes.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Unfortunately, it's death AND taxes."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's going to look like you don't want to face your accuser!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think Habeas Corpus is the best way to go here...
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,What happened to the ghost of Christmas past? He was Scrooge's key witness!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I know you're trying to make a point here, but we really should have settled out of court."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, Grim, I told you - you're just a humble farmer. The sickle had beat juice on it."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,There's not much we can do. You were clocked going 90.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,- I took the scythe cause it might adversely affect the jury! - But they can't convict me when it's my job!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. I'm requesting an anonymous jury. They will relate to you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We're trying to get the scythe found at the scene ruled inadmissible.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Look. Accepting payment obligates you to transport.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Is it possible to lose the hoodie? The jurors can't relate to you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Tell them you were just following orders.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Fortunately, the state just repealed the eternal life penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just remember. We're pleading ex post facto.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""This is not going well""."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Would it kill you to lose the hoodie?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge denied your Writ of Habeas Corpse
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news. The prosecutor isn't seeking the death penalty for you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Remember: Don't look the jury in the eye.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, keep your answers short and I'll lighten things up on redirect."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The prosecution took the death penalty off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Could you try looking a little less grim?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"We can appeal, but I don't think a different judge will grant you the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Would you be mad if you heard I don't believe in the death penalty?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The DA says he won't plea bargain with death.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. All they care about is the Panama accounts.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think the jury is going to buy the 'Dead men tell no tales' defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Cross your fingers, I think I can get you the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,we'll call your scythe as the next witness
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We lucked out. The judge is dead.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You know, it's not like pleading guilty is going to kill you"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I came to take your life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Get rid of the hoodie. It makes you look guilty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge and jury may not look too kindly at your professional success.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you were the devil, we could create sympathy."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"And keep calm on the stand; remember: no scythe, no proof."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It wouldn’t hurt to smile a little when you testify.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you want a shot at winning this, you really should consider getting a new suit."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It might help if you didn't say ""Yes!"" whenever the prosecution recommended the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think the jury will buy the self defense argument
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't kill me, but I can't seem to find your birth certificate."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"To be honest, I've never handled a death penalty case before."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you cop to the first billion counts, I might be able to get your sentence reduced."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"As your attorney, I don't recommend requesting death."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I told you not to wear that outfit for the trial.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,No! No! No! You are NOT starting with the same fan base as OJ!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm confident the prosecution won't be able to positively identify you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm pinning our hopes on re-branding.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Really?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm sorry, but the judge thinks you're a risk to the community."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news. You're getting a life sentence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I don't think we have to worry about them seeking the death penalty
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If things go wrong, you might get the you penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try to be more upbeat when you take the stand.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They want you to serve life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we should file a petition for habeas corpus.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't worry, I'm going to get you the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just don't react when the judge mentions the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Gender bias is the least of our problems.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You may be the Grimm Reaper, but it's still Murder 1."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Slowing overpopulation is a weak defense, but it's all we got."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The souls were nonexempt
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Stop, stop. . . he said griM, not griN."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You get weekends and Easter.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your look is not helping our case.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"don't worry, we are going to appeal your live penalty sentence"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You'd think the right to remain silent wouldn't have been so hard for you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Evidently, Face Time is dead."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge would like to hear your thoughts on the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's still considered a penalty in the eyes of the law.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your death sentence is being appealed.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Know anything about a scythe?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just stare at the judge and we'll be fine.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Life without parole seems more humane.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You will take "" life in prison""!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Trust me. 'Wardrobe malfunction' is not the best way to go.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It would really help your case if you could remember where you left your scythe.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You'd have had more luck if you'd gone with the plaid shirt and sport coat like I said.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This is why it's so hard to come for a lawyer.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Tell him you have a vow of silence.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Not one character witness will speak in your defense?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mr. Reaper, I would advise against you taking the stand in your own defense."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just when did you first realize that you were dead?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Two things - I think you should take the stand, and what was Elvis like?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The jury might be more sympathetic if you didn't insist on wearing that hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Is that business formal where you come from?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suggest a habeas corpus defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Life is certainly not on the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your being here today will assure they can NOT positively identify you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I have to advise you to keep a low profile.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I know the death penalty thing appeals to you but this is only a minor traffic violation
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"C'mon, man . . . the trial hasn't even started!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, killing the judge right now would not be looked upon favorably by the jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So what part of 'my client has nothing to hide' didn't you understand?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Listen, Eminem, the Unibomber's intellectual property suit is not just going away; I really think we should offer a settlement."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should take the deal
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm glad you brought your game face.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So the deal is I'll get you probation if you give me another 60 years. And you do something about my mother-in-law.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm here for the hung jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,These wrongful death cases can be tricky
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The best I can get you is life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You;ve gotta stop pointing at the jurors and shouting 'You're next!"""
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. There's no death penalty in this state.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sorry, forgeting to recycle isn't a capital offense yet."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge says it's the worst case of identity theft he's ever seen .
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Seriously? You want me to tell them you didn't reap the benefits?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The thing is ... courts in this State are pro-second Amendment and 'open carry', but a sickle, that's a whole different issue."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You look like murder.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I can try arguing self defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Okay tomorrow wear a 3 piece suit
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, the prior Remember the ten billion prior deaths can't be admitted in this case"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Show your compassionate side.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I got them to drop the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"You are the Grim Reaper."" ""Well this time, I'm innocent, so prove it, or you will be my next victim."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're right - you should do the closing argument.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'll claim you're being framed because of the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think it's time to put a scare into juror number three.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Its a pretty big list. Can't you just pick out the famous ones?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, I know how to pronounce it, but I'm still going to call you Dr. Deeth."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge may perceive the death penalty as a conflict of interest.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They're leaning toward the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should have told me you once worked for the IRS.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I would take the life sentence if I were you.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you should drop the lawsuit. They're not going to repeal the helmut law
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Might help with the jury if you had a nickname other than ""Grim."" How do you feel about ""Scooter""?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I don't think ""If the hood don't fit we must acquit"" defense will work here."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Counsel for the defense, you may step down."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I guess if all else fails we can try the no face defense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They threw out 106 billion of the counts against you based on the statute of limitations, but that still leaves 1 billion."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It's do or die, not open and shut."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just say you manage retirement plans.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't count on a sympathetic jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"It looks grim, Reaper."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your image problem is killing us.
1909,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,517,I think the best we can hope for is life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They're asking for the death penalty, but I don't think they've thought the logistics through properly."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Jury No. 3 has the same outfit!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suggest we petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I advise you not to take the stand
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's hope for a hung jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, yes. Scientology does enforce that Billion Year Contract."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We're good-this judge is pro-death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Of course in your case the death penalty is not a viable option.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The stages here are similar to what you're used to seeing. Deny everything, argue, plea bargain, but ultimately accept the verdict."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think I get you life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The judge is in poor health. He'll listen.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You really killed them in your cross-examination
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"We'd like to request a brief recess to, uh, kill your Honor."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Listen--if you want to have a shot with the jury, you've gotta drop the hoodie."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I can't put you on the stand. We both know you killed him.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't you think you're getting a bit overzealous? It's only an embezzlement case,"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm afraid they're seeking the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Nothing extrajudicial this time, ok?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your membership in Grimm Reapers Matters is not helping
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"What do you mean you didn't bring the scythe?! Great, the prosecution is just going to kill you up there."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The death sentence is off the table.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Things are looking pretty grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,There is no higher court.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, I think we can plea it down to a life sentence."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Can I testify on my behalf?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The good news is it's not a capital offense.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your chances would improve if you wore a tie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Because I think if we bring up your zombie days you'l have a better chance.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They're seeking the life penalty
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sorry; life without parole. I know you had your heart set on the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How do you know their lead witness won't testify?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think we have a better chance if we go with your middle name - Larry Reaper'
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to sneeze. It only annoys the jurors.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, they won't give you the death penalty for tax evasion."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The problem is mainly the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Mr. Trump had to blame someone for killing his campaign!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Ok, we’ll make a go at it, but you shouldn't really count on a sympathetic jury."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Take. The. Stand.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Lucky for us they got no fingerprints off the scythe.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Are you sure you want to seek a life sentence?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't answer any questions about taxes. Death you can talk about.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Get over it - there's no way to get your scythe through security.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,My advice? Lose the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to mention anything about your past.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"This is our last appeal, so please stop referring to your sentence the 'me penalty.'"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Are you certain?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Life is the best we can hope for.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. I think they will have a hard time finding a jury of your peers.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's completely circumstantial; it could have been anyone's scythe.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Bad news. Famine just turned state's witness.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Our only chance is if you can make eye contact with every juror.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Bad news, looks like your getting life..."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"NO, no, my services are free if you promise me not to visit me for at least a hundred years or more. Oh! would you go by and visit my mother in law later today?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Is the death penalty fine with you?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your attire might be a little grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Good news: you got the death penalty
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"""After you testify it’s witness protection with a new identity as an Italian geriatric nurse?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The prosecution is now claiming your DNA is all over the scythe they found at the scene.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Know of any newly available rent-controlled apartments?
1909,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,517,I'm glad I've got you as my lawyer.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"That's fine, but then you'll need to do the taxes phase of the trial."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Care for a breath mint?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try to connect with the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you should try losing the hoodie.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Is there something about losing a chess game that you didn't tell me about?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You can't keep doing that to the jury!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,They had it coming
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Well, I wouldn't have chosen it but then again, I'm not guilty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Death....you need to take the stand....You are facing life.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're killing me here.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Remember, you were just the lackey who delivered fresh souls to Satan. Eternal damnation was his idea."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"No, the teeth are fine. Juries like toothy. But let's just get you some wax lips, eh?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We just have to convince the jury you were on holiday.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Mr. Death, as your counsel I STRONGLY urge you to plead the fifth."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Tax evasion? I mean, you of all people."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So the plea is, you go free and everyone lives, right?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let me get this right....you WANT the death penalty?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Worst case scenario eternity without parole.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The bottom line is....you didn't pay your taxes.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We're going to try to plead it down to being the anthropomorphic personification of involuntary manslaughter.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Look, I'm the editor of this magazine, and I get to say which stories get killed. Case dismissed."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Plead not guilty then we'll implicate Father Time.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It's a wrongful death suit.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Frankly, grim does'nt cut it."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Keep it up and the outcome will be grim, too."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Its true people can't cheat you, but corporations can."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,But the most hurtful part was being accused of lacking judgment.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The death penalty isn't much of a plea bargain.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think you should pick the jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Your tonsure is telling
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Just need to make sure we agree on what we mean by jury 'selection' . . .
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should face the jury before they vote.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,How do you feel about ankle bracelets?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I think I can get the death penalty off the table!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm glad you ditched the scythe, but would it have hurt you to put on a tie?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,This should be a slam dunk. The prosecution has no eyewitnesses!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I'm sorry I'm not familiar with the Grim Reaper clause.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They have 100,000 years of evidence...Our chances look grim.."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Don't worry. They can't get a positive ID on your face.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"As your tax attorney, I hope to subtract one item from that so called two-things-for-certain list."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You should have appealed earlier.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I really wish you wouldn't take the phrase ""face your accuser"" so personally."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I wasn't able to locate any of your alibis.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"The penalty is death, but we'll argue for time served."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"So I told him, 'Not til Hell Freezes Over!'"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Max von Sydow refused to be a character witness.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"If you agree with the involuntary manslaughter plea, nod your hood."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Let's just agree that the death penalty is a moot point
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,So - are you okay with the death penalty?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Death Lives Matter!
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I hate to say this, but we're probably looking at the death penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,It looks like we have a hung jury.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I have to be honest, there's a very good chance you could get the dea... the you penalty."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Habeas Corpus not Rigor Mortis
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You're killing me.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Sir, this is a tax case--I am certain we can win on appeal."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,Try not to giggle if they give you the death penalty.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Don't forget, don't smile at the jury!"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,I suppose that an appeal is unlikely.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Pro bono, not pro bone."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,You can't take a holiday--your trial starts tomorrow.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They have you dead to rights, I'll see if we can settle."
1909,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,517,So what it's a death penalty case. What do you care?
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"They've dropped the murder charges, but the tax evasion charges stuck."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,We think that your visitation rights should be limited.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Listen, can you get me out of this profession?"
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I am sure the scythe is fine, just keep track of your claim ticket."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,The verdict is looking pretty grim.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"I'm not so confident the jury will buy our not guilty plea with the whole ""death personified"" look you've got going on today."
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,When you testify be sure to face the jurors.
1909,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,517,"Relax, Christmas Past and Present have agreed to testify for you."

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Maybe I should not have hired a lawyer who was in the witness-protection program.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Don't worry, this state still has the death penalty."

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,We'll try to avoid the you penalty....
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"No, the death penalty does not apply to parking violations"

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,We're sticking with mistaken identity.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,At least you look less menacing to the jury without your scythe.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"You death, me taxes. Together we'd be unstoppable."

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,We'll just tell the jury you're from the hood. It doesn't sound as grim.

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I know you feel strongly about the hoody but generally a jury is swayed by some positive eye contact.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I wouldn't take the plea. It's life without parole.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"With a little luck, you’ll get life."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,You didn't tell me there were multiple counts.

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I think we should plead insanity
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Don't worry, orange is the new black."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Either way it's a death sentence.
3099,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,517,The case is circumstantial at best. No one ever saw your face.
3099,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,517,"You are right, it does look grim."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Your Honor, my client pleads not guilty on the grounds that he was just doing his job."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Well, they're giving you life."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,What? You're not certain about your taxes?

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Look, I know the Death Penalty doesn't frighten you, but I've got a reputation to defend."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"So we're sticking with the ""Trick or Treat"" alibi?"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"As your lawyer, I strongly advise that your case will go better for you if you lose the hoodie."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I was thinking maybe life without parole
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Not a problem. Your scythe tested clean.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"You were right, we have a hung jury."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"When they call you to the witness stand, you want to be a little bit more forthcoming."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,They're offering a life sentence.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"It's a little bizarre, but it may help convince the jury that you were a victim of identity theft."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"No, you can't try on the scythe. It's not a glove."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"I told you to wear the navy, I can only do so much."

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,We'll appeal if you get life.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,They have the right to face their accuser.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Legally, doing every other death ever doesn't mean you did this one."

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Of course, for you death isn't a penalty."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Remember, we are going for a temporary insanity verdict."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Remember, your an actuary, not Death, plays much better with the jury."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Just keep your poker face.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Do I still get paid if you don't get a death sentence?
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Please stop requesting a hung jury.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,They're going to have a devil of a time making a positive ID.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Don't worry. The death penalty was repealed here years ago.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,No you can't tell the judge you have met Justice Scalia.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Perfect! And I'll handle the tax issues.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,My client pleads not guilty by reason of inevitability.
3099,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,517,But wouldn't taking the judges soul just prove their case?
3099,1,0,9,10,1.2,0.19999999999999998,517,"So, you're telling me that the death penalty isn't even on the table?"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I think we can do better than the death penalty for a traffic violation.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"She may have said it, but where's the evidence that she agreed ""until death do us part""?"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're above the law.

3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Yes, the hoodie stays on. Now let's drop it."
3099,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,517,your hoodie will just prejudice the jury
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"After this, I'm getting my taxes done. Wanna come?"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,You can't plea bargain a death sentence for a parking ticket.
3099,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,517,Are you my new public defender?
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,The judge has just told me that when sentencing you he needs to take into account the other one hundred billion cases of murder
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"It's ""inevitable"" and ""would you rather pay taxes"" are not good defenses."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"He’s simply here, Your Honor, for a “meet and greet” with the defendant."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Just to play it safe, let the judge see your face."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,You can't hang the jury yourself.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Like I said, you can’t plead 'its my job.'"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Let's put it this way: The scythe of justice cuts slowly, but it cuts really deep ..."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I recommend that you take the Fifth.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Tax evasion, huh?"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,At least capital punishment is out of the question.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,You are not in witness protection yet.
3099,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,517,I know you want the death penalty but this is traffic court.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Just one juror not on your list, and we are home free."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"I'm sorry, but you don't have a snowball's chance in hell."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Try to look friendly.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"I'm so sorry, I know what a life sentence means to you."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I think the hoodie sends the wrong message.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,You should have gone with the grey suit and blue tie.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,You should have picked out a different colored hoodie.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Remember, this is just a formality."
3099,0,2,8,10,1.2,0.13333333333333333,517,"Sorry, I think they are going to give you life!"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"No pun intended, but our chances look grim."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I think we may have a problem finding impartial jurors.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"So, you're claiming the guy was dead when you got there?"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"We're going with a Lawful Capacity of Office defense, you were just doing your job"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,This is not a good time.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Can you come back tomorrow, after closing arguments?"
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Take it! You'll be out in a 100 years with good behavior.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"This is the first time anyone has tried the ""necessary evil"" defense, so we'll see how it goes."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Telling Juror #8 that his time is near did not help your case.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Let's put you on the stand in your defense.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Just say that you weren't there.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Are you seriously asking me if you're going to get the death sentence?
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"I'm thinking the hood defense--If it doesn't fit, you must acquit."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Remember, without fingerprints, they can't prove anything."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"Not now, Death - I have to finish this trial."
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Your best defense is that you are a myth.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I think it will be abundantly clear to the jury that growing up in the 'hood had a big impact on your identity formation.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,I think I can get it knocked down to 107 billion counts of manslaughter.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,The only way you will get the jury to like you is if you take out Shkreli.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,So is this your first time as the plaintiff?
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,Remember to maintain good eye contact with the jurors.
3099,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,517,"No, that won't fly; it really was worse than taxes."
3225,0,2,9,11,1.1818181818181819,0.12196734422726127,517,I think I can get the murder charges dropped down to aiding and abetting.
3225,0,2,9,11,1.1818181818181819,0.12196734422726127,517,"Okay, John Doe, here we go again."
3225,0,2,9,11,1.1818181818181819,0.12196734422726127,517,"Don;t worry, the bailiff forgot to bring a bible"
3225,1,0,10,11,1.1818181818181819,0.18181818181818182,517,I don’t care if it’s your “brand.” We’re trying to beat a wrongful death charge and you’re not helping.
3225,0,2,9,11,1.1818181818181819,0.12196734422726127,517,"Don't worry, we'll put forward a spirited defense."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"I’m not sure if it’s irony or synergy, but I started out as a tax attorney."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You're lucky our firm does pro bono work.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"So much for that Witness Protection Program, huh?"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Another continuance, right?"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Death, be not proud-especially when you take the stand..."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Remember, if the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Jurors tend to look at someone like you as just an empty suit
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Are you there ?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,I think there's a hole in our case.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,I don't swear in.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,No chance in hell you'll win on wrongful death.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You look like a 'New Yorker Cartoon'
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Saying you were just doing your job won’t work.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,What's the trick to holding up that hood?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"If your priority is the scythe, I'm afraid she's gonna take all of the pale horse."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"We're unlikely to get parole, given your record..."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,I suggest a plea of not guilty by reason of inevitability.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Death be not your name?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Did anybody see you do it?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"OK, no scythe is good, but I told you to wear a suit and tie."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,I prefer my clients to show more optimism!
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You're being charged with aiding and abetting.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"I see you're wearing an American Giant hoodie... waited six months for mine but it was definitely worth it...fantastic product, don't you think?"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Tell them it wasn't a weapon you just wanted to cut down their high grass.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You've been accused of wrongful death. How do you want to plead?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Try to lose the smirk, will you?"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Usually I advise against plea bargaining for the death penalty for a parking violation.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,I told you to put on a suit and tie and get a haircut. What's up with this?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"No, there is no glove you can try to put on."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"I cannot advise ""I had to see a man about a dog"" as your best defense."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Trust me. If anyone has standing as a sovereign citizen, it's you!"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You have got to tell me now. Do you ever carry a scythe?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Well, the IRS is certain you did not pay these taxes."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Maybe a suit and tie tomorrow.
3230,0,2,10,12,1.1666666666666667,0.11236664374387371,517,I'm afraid that your case looks rather grim.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You may have taken Habeas Corpus a bit too literally
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,remember to put your best face on for the jury.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Mortal coil? Not me, lawyer client privilege!"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Don't worry, they couldn't pick you out of the lineup!"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Grim, you've done it again. You're in the wrong courtroom. This is traffic court and that outfit has to go."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You're telling me this now?
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"But you never actually killed anybody, right?"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,We need to save face on this
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,I asked the judge for community service.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Remember, what happened in the hood stays in the hood."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Please don't take him until he pays my bill.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Good point. The death penalty would be a bit redundant.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Just be yourself.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,You’re my first client to request the death penalty.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"For the appeal, I'd suggest you wear a suit and tie."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"I understand you are cold, but, in this case, a sweater would have been a better choice."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Mort, where are the jurors? You didn't..."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Piece of cake. My firm represented Ted Kennedy.
3230,0,2,10,12,1.1666666666666667,0.11236664374387371,517,"Do I have to go right now, or can I call my wife and say I won't be home for awhile?"
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Character witnesses are going to be a problem.
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"On second thought, the maximum sentence might be OK."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,"Remember, try not to over-react."
3230,0,1,5,6,1.1666666666666667,0.18257418583505536,517,Why in the world would I want to plea bargain for life imprisonment?

3407,0,0,3,3,1.0,0.408248290463863,517,"So, should we seek the death penalty?"
3407,0,0,3,3,1.0,0.408248290463863,517,"So our defense is that if the scythe was a lethal weapon, it was therefore a tool of your trade"

3407,0,0,2,2,1.0,0.7071067811865476,517,The charge will be reduced to manslaughter if we can prove it was an accident.
3407,0,0,3,3,1.0,0.408248290463863,517,I wouldn't use that expression with this judge.

3407,0,0,3,3,1.0,0.408248290463863,517,No. I would not recommend that you testify.
3407,0,0,3,3,1.0,0.408248290463863,517,I don't think you have much of a chance but at least you don't have to worry about the death penalty.

3407,0,0,2,2,1.0,0.7071067811865476,517,It would behoove you to not look into the eyes of the jury.
