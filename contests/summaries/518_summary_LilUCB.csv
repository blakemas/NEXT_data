422,4,8,30,42,1.380952380952381,0.10196889230033897,518,He should try thinking outside the box.
422,3,10,29,42,1.380952380952381,0.09610522780331827,518,He comes here for the Jersey shore experience.
422,3,10,29,42,1.380952380952381,0.09610522780331827,518,I think he just meowed. Let's get out of here.
422,3,10,29,42,1.380952380952381,0.09610522780331827,518,Did you tell him we've found the shovel?

422,4,8,30,42,1.380952380952381,0.10196889230033897,518,The wavy line over his head means he smells bad.
422,3,10,29,42,1.380952380952381,0.09610522780331827,518,"I'd like to help him, but we're just mirages."

436,3,8,26,37,1.3783783783783783,0.10506219630351894,518,Now if only we could get him to stop spraying.
436,4,6,27,37,1.3783783783783783,0.11198020625816267,518,Is this what a midlife crisis looks like?

442,5,7,33,45,1.3777777777777778,0.10194516692557685,518,He thinks he is Lawrence of Exurbia.

442,4,9,32,45,1.3777777777777778,0.09686442096757054,518,I think he just realized it's a litter box.
442,2,13,30,45,1.3777777777777778,0.08580509325897093,518,I guess burying Dad's bottles in the sandbox completely backfired huh?
442,3,11,31,45,1.3777777777777778,0.09150199472843042,518,There must be a grain of truth in here.
442,4,9,32,45,1.3777777777777778,0.09686442096757054,518,We should open a lemonade stand.
442,3,11,31,45,1.3777777777777778,0.09150199472843042,518,He catastrophizes everything.
449,5,5,30,40,1.375,0.11144447853021608,518,We should've known adult coloring books would be a slippery slope for John...
449,2,11,27,40,1.375,0.09259437320225214,518,Should we say something?
449,5,5,30,40,1.375,0.11144447853021608,518,He's also been talking about going gluten free
449,3,9,28,40,1.375,0.0992762269164639,518,He can't see the sand for the box.
449,4,7,29,40,1.375,0.10553587310872314,518,My dad has bigger hangovers than your dad.
449,3,9,28,40,1.375,0.0992762269164639,518,My teacher said the deserts in Tokyo are even smaller.
449,3,9,28,40,1.375,0.0992762269164639,518,He only thinks inside the box.
449,3,9,28,40,1.375,0.0992762269164639,518,This could get ugly. He identifies as a cat.

1226,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,518,He's looking for his raison d etre.
1226,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,518,Does he know it's only for cats?
1226,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,518,Think he'd mind if we jumped in?
1226,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,518,It must be a case of arrested development.
1226,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,518,"Poppa, I'm going to ignore, for the moment, the pail, and the shovel, and the sandbox you apparently think is a wasteland, and just point out that you seem to have a sans serif 'S' floating over your head."
1226,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,518,"He said it's the latest physical fitness craze, Death Valley Crawl."
1226,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,518,"Can't explore the Gobi on a teacher's pay, dude!"
1226,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,518,"I don't know what you've been feeding the cat, but we need to get to the vet as soon as possible."
1226,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,518,"Not ""contract"", ""contact."" He's upset because he lost a contact."
1226,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,518,"Whew! He's Lawrence of Arabia, today. Since he's not Felix the Cat, we won't need the shovel and pail, after all."
1226,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,518,It's for my report on the California drought. I believe in hyperrealism.
1226,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,518,I heard you were never supposed to wake up a Sleep Crawler.
1226,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,518,He's paid to check for needles.
1226,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,518,Why don't we just bury him up to the neck.
1226,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,518,Now lets see how he reacts to a bucket of dry ice
1226,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,518,"He also failed ""Rithmetic""."
1226,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,518,Dude!? This is our beach.
1274,2,4,25,31,1.2580645161290323,0.10336012766191757,518,Try giving him your juice box.
1274,0,8,23,31,1.2580645161290323,0.07988892740217941,518,Shouldn't we tell Mommy?
1274,0,8,23,31,1.2580645161290323,0.07988892740217941,518,I thought desert cross training was just a fad too until my dad replaced my sandbox with a crawlmaster 5000.
1274,1,6,24,31,1.2580645161290323,0.09237303911791196,518,Fair's fair. He got here first.
1274,1,6,24,31,1.2580645161290323,0.09237303911791196,518,"""If we bury a Metro Card, maybe he'll move on to Coney Island""."
1274,0,8,23,31,1.2580645161290323,0.07988892740217941,518,"By the time he finds the nickel he lost, it will only be worth a penny and a half."
1274,2,4,25,31,1.2580645161290323,0.10336012766191757,518,Please tell me that this is just another mirage.
1274,2,4,25,31,1.2580645161290323,0.10336012766191757,518,"And here he is, 'Midway on our life's journey.'"
1274,1,6,24,31,1.2580645161290323,0.09237303911791196,518,It's cat scratch fever.
1274,3,2,26,31,1.2580645161290323,0.11328659949304021,518,"Just shout ""There's a parking space at Trader Joe's!"" and the sandbox is ours."
1274,1,6,24,31,1.2580645161290323,0.09237303911791196,518,I'd have waited till sundown.
1274,1,6,24,31,1.2580645161290323,0.09237303911791196,518,During tax season this is the closest to the shore he ever gets.
1286,1,7,27,35,1.2571428571428571,0.08543371446816023,518,I told you it wasn't a good idea to bury Dad's Adult Channel pin number.
1286,1,7,27,35,1.2571428571428571,0.08543371446816023,518,"Excuse me sir, we reserved this sandbox for this time."
1288,1,9,33,43,1.255813953488372,0.07510069472064661,518,I told you not to invite Lawrence.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,He just totally misses the concept of manscaping.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,He's going for the Guinness World Record for the longest Pub Crawl.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"Mother says its imperfect, but he does keep the cats out."
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Johnson never could think outside the box.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,I guess no man really is an island
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,"He identifies as catwoman , she legally can use this as a litter box ."
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,wine...wine...
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"Sure he's listening to his inner child, but his adult is so big!"
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Isn't that his contact lens on the sidewalk?
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Your dad is so 'method'.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,"Well, this is as close to the beach as I'm ever going to get."
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,So this is what you meant when you said beach day...
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,"Performance art my ass, I want the sandbox!"
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,The Corporate Litterbox
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,"Trust him, he knows a shortcut."
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,My mom says this is what’s called “imaginative play.” My dad is acting out his search for meaning.
1289,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,518,"Three more days, and he gets the promotion."
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,I think he's having trouble thinking outside the sandbox.
1289,2,1,17,20,1.25,0.14281014264436986,518,He comes here to practice. He's going to a casting call for a role in a cartoon in The New Yorker.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,He asked me how far Malibu was.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,I remember hiding my lunch money in here.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,I guess you have to do more than think outside the box.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Dad?
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,I think he's looking for his dignity.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"Performance art, my ass. He's looking for the Xanax he dropped up here during our playdate yesterday."
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,It's my Ben garden.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He says he won't stop until he finds his contact lens.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He always wanted his own private beach.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,It's his annual Passover reenactment.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,He's always losing his keys.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,He'd better start thinking outside the box.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Show him the oasis.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"On the internet, nobody cares if you're a cat. But here? It matters ...."
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,"He was laid off weeks ago, but by law, they can't physically remove him."
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,I guess we could make him an oasis.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Mom said the Condo Board made him get rid of his camel.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,In a previous life he was Lawrence of Arabia.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Are you seeing that too?
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Dad Got kicked out of hot yoga for being too dramatic.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,He's trying to adapt to global warming.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Method actor.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He still digs his early years.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Dad! Can you practice your part for your theater group's play somewhere else?
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,We should check the pool.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"He was a terrapin, yesterday."
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,"Mr. Drysdale, you said the desert study wouldn't get in the way of recess!"
1289,1,6,25,32,1.25,0.08980265101338746,518,Mr. Martin has a dry sense of humor.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Take Your Dad to Play Day is just wrong.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,You know there is no coming back when they mistake the sandbox for the litter box.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,I't's titled 'Man Seeking Lost Youth'
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,I'd lend a hand BUT he looks Syrian.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,"Oh we must be early, he’s usually only here until the bar next door opens"
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,He's been playing in there for a long time.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He said our turn would come after graduate school.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,"Well, he did say he wanted an 'Oasis in the City'."
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Looks like we got the pick of the litter box again.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,It's his safe space.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Will he figure out New York is just a mirage?
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He claims to be the sole surviving investor in 'Ishtar.'
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,His first choice was a lap pool.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"I don't want to play ""Death Valley"" today."
1289,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,518,Better him than the cat.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Court is in recess.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,You got to crawl before you can walk!
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,He really needs to think outside the box.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,He's taking all the fun out of it for me.
1289,3,1,24,28,1.25,0.12198750911856665,518,Just another old guy trying to navigate the social media of a younger generation.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,"Dad looks dry, must be time for happy hour."
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Are we just a mirage?
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,"It's called a ""Man Box."""
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,That's what repeating kindergarten eight times will do to you.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,I hate actors.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,I heard free range sandboxes are really trending among city dwellers.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,We should have gotten a puppy.
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,"and for a mere $5.2M, you can get this motorized infinity desert installed on your private deck."
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,This is the closest he's gotten all week.
1289,3,2,27,32,1.25,0.10998533626601496,518,You can take a bum off the beach...
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Grown-ups have trouble thinking outside the box.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,The buzzards are here. How much longer for recess?
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Early fascination with Lawrence of Arabia.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,They say he never could think outside the box.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Well my father's nervous breakdown is off the charts compared to yours.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Dad really needs a vacation!
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,I wish I had his stamina.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,He leaves at 3:30 when happy hour starts.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,I preferred it when the only thing that caused us alarm was the orange tabby.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,He's training to be in the New Yorker.
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Should we tell him this is not the little stretch of beach he's worked for all his life?
1289,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,518,Can't get past being voted off the island on the next-to-last show.
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,Adults are so dramatic! There's a drinking fountain on the other side of the playground!
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,Not an other conceptual artist!
1289,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,518,You think this really is an episode on SURVIVOR?
1289,0,7,21,28,1.25,0.08333333333333333,518,It's an installation called 'Lawrence of Bronxville.'
