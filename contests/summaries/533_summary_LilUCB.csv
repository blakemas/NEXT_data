1393,5,14,61,80,1.3,0.06511917021211132,533,I'm afraid having your martinis stirred is not an option.
1393,4,16,60,80,1.3,0.06264224319827152,533,You want the other platform—this is express.
1393,5,14,61,80,1.3,0.06511917021211132,533,"To start, may I suggest the steamed mussels with fennel, tomatoes, and cream, served with two sets of our signature corded earplugs."

1393,5,14,61,80,1.3,0.06511917021211132,533,"Can I suggest the ""Midnight Special?"""
1393,8,8,64,80,1.3,0.07204077607661873,533,"Anyway, the service is good. The waiter comes every four to five minutes -- unless there's an 'incident' at 34th Street."
1393,5,14,61,80,1.3,0.06511917021211132,533,If you close your eyes you could almost think you're in Paris' subway.
