1097,1,5,15,21,1.3333333333333333,0.1259881576697424,519,I guess a bird in the hand is really worth more than two in the bush.

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,We must be in 'Portlandia.'
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I bet this is the last time he plays truth or dare with us.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Too bad, it's tails; he lost."
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Watch out, Farmer Brown is using the old decoy game again."
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,He's never distracted by a tweet.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Poor, nearsighted thing."

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Suck up.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I think we need to have a talk with him. I don't like this new friend he's hanging out with.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Keep watching, he's gonna sit on the guy's hat next!"
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,It all makes sense once you've met his wife.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"That's him, Elmers's stool pigeon."
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I thought heli-skiing would get it out of his system
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,That's absolutely brilliant! He found the safest place to be when a bird hunter is on the loose.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,You gotta give her credit...denial suites her
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I heard that he got laid off at the coal mine
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,He sold us out for some grains and seeds.

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,I guess it's like having eyes in the back of your head.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,"That reminds me, I need to check my Twitter feed."
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Some type of young pigeon---a stoolie, I think."

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Be assured: we will get a bang out of this!!!
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,These crazy kids nowadays. They call it a 'perch-in.'
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,How does that saying go?
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Well that's one way to ""flip him the bird."""
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,It thinks he's Bernie.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,A pilot bird. They never go extinct.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,"Wait? I thought a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush?"" ""Yea, but the guy walking his dog over there is a blind as a bat"

2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Kids today!
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,He's feeling confident after that Bernie event.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,That could be a cardinal sin
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Clearly no flocking together with that one!
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,He always was a problem child.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"That bird needs to bite the bird seed, not bite the bullet."
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Somehow... its a symbiotic relationship
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I don't think he noticed us giving him the bird.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"I think it's a bird in hand...not ""on gun."""

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,She forgot her selfie stick again.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,That hunter's really got game.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Well, it's something to strive for..."
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,"Yeah, he likes to show off a lot, but is he a good provider?"
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Told you it was him - the bird in the hand.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Looks Like Patti & Elmer had another fight.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"One, maybe two, more solid pecks and ""Jackhammer Ralph"" should have that front sight misaligned."

2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Ever since the mine closed he was out of work.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Petey always had a death wish.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,He must be from Portland.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"And that's how the expression ""bird-brain"" originated."
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Bill just doesn't get the idea of 'a good guy with a gun.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I knew her yellow feathers spelt trouble.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,That's what I call playing hard to get.

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,I think it's a chutzpahtridge.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,That bird is right up Lapierre's butt.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,We need cool hats.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Must've been a double-dog dare.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,He lost the bet.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think!"
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,"Obviously, we have our own Benedict Arnold!"
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Is this your first trip to Switzerland?
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,"What does he think we are, Dodos?"
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I don't think Edward is clear on the concept of bird hunting.

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,This pretty much ends our reconciliation.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,He's farsighted
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Loneliness makes strange bedfellows!

2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I saw it on TV. It's Popeil's new vertically integrated hunting system: decoy and shotgun in one compact unit.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,He called it.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I thought Elmer Fudd was just a myth.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I prefer he sticks to Bernie rallies
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,"""Your dad can be embarrassing sometimes. Especially when he lets his boyfriend play in the sandpit""."

2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,He's just not that in to you
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,It looks like Tweety has joined the enemy as an observer.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Robin actually convinced him to go vegan except for the occasional worm.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Want to fly over and see if it's a decoy?

2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,Doesn't look like he'll be contributing to the gene pool
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,We assume his third genie wish will not have an ambiguous Twitter abbreviation.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,You have to assume that hunters in the dodo bird era were a tad sharper.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,What a sight.
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,How many tweets could a twitter twit tweet if a twitter twit could tweet tweets?

2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Only invasive species will do that job.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,Looks like the NRA is trying to soften its image!
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,I suppose a bird on the rifle is worth...
2398,1,1,14,16,1.1875,0.13597640726733934,519,That's the bravest form of protest.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,I told you not to trust that bird.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,So much for flocking together.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,At least now we know who's the double agent!
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,We taught her well about turning an enemy into a friend.
2398,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,519,He needs a better lookout!
