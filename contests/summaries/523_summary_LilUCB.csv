2206,2,6,41,49,1.2040816326530612,0.07130699079332185,523,There was a sale at Crate & Barrel Of Monkeys.

2251,1,12,56,69,1.2028985507246377,0.052958951374245035,523,You just had to open the barrel.
2253,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,523,Monkey business is booming.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,Inviting your family over will not change my mind about Creationism.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,I thought I was getting a deal on wine.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,Of all the mail-order courses to take you had to pick primatology.
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,I liked them better when they were just jumping' on the bed.
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,This marriage is driving me bananas.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,"This is not what I meant when I suggested ""12 Monkeys"" for date night."
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,You should be flattered - Bobo never gropes a face on the first date.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,When did you say Tarzan and Jane were coming back??
2253,0,14,56,70,1.2,0.04815434123430769,523,I trust that's the last time you'll refer to me as Curious George?
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,It's time to call a professional.
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,What happened to the typewriters?
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,I'm sorry. I could only afford half a barrel.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I think they like your place.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,They're merely chaotic extensions of my finely tuned sex drive.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,I hope you remembered the bananas.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I don't think this is fun at all!
2253,3,9,63,75,1.2,0.05694947974514994,523,I can't help but think you're up to some monkey business.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,I thought they were only talking about cage free chickens.
2253,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,523,YOU didn't want kids...
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,This is your idea of monkeying around?
2253,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,523,I thought you said this would be fun.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,Perhaps a barrelful was too many.
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,These pre war apartments always have a pest problem.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,Not what you had in mind for that swinging group from Airbnb?
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I checked Amazon- they don't sell Jumanji.
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,I wish the vet hadn't recommended in vitro.
2253,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,523,This is not working. I'll put them back in the barrel.
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,You said they would stay in the barrel.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,Jeffery you promised not to bring your work home.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,But which one stole my yellow hat?
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I liked it better when we were the only primates living here.
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,Tell him you just want to hang out.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,Did the barrel come with a guarantee of fun?
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,It only makes sense if you are Jane Goodall
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,Kids made the point. They are not worse than a troop of monkeys.
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,So much for abstinence education.
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,I can't remember the last time I had a banana on my cereal.
2253,0,7,28,35,1.2,0.06859943405700354,523,It's your turn to put the monkeys back in the barrel.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,You're the one that wanted pets.
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,I told you your breath smells like bananas.
2253,0,6,24,30,1.2,0.07427813527082072,523,Where are the other two monkeys?
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,Have you noticed it's getting harder to keep bananas in the house?
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,For my prime mate.
2253,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,523,I told you home schooling was going to be a challenge.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,I think almost anything is more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,It’s confirmed - a barrel of monkeys is not fun.
2253,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,523,We really need a barrel to make this more fun.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I told you not to invite your whole family.
2253,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,523,Let's do some monkey business of our own.
2253,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,523,Don't worry ... They know we are on the endangered species list!
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,I have to get these monkeys off my back.
2253,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,523,Stop with your monkey business!
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,It's only till they find a new habitat.
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,Wait till I teach them to file our tax returns.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I asked you to order 12 Monkeys.
2253,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,523,I didn't hear you complaining when you spent the money we saved on barrel assembly fees
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,No. We should not get a cat!
2253,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,523,You were right . I should have ordered the full barrel.
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,I can't resist a BOGO.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I really wish you wouldn't bring your work home with you.
2253,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,523,Pandora - I told you not to open the barrel.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,At least we didn't get Dalmatians!
2253,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,523,How many monkeys jumping on the bed?
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,"Just look at the camera and say ""cheese."""
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,I thought you were supposed to get the bananas.
2253,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,523,But they only mimic people they like.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,This monkey business is getting out of hand.
2253,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,523,How do you keep all their names straight?
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,How many bananas did you get last week?
2253,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,523,This is the best maid service you could get?
2253,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,523,I didn't say it would be more fun IN a barrel of monkeys.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,Yes. I'm certain the barrel came with a dozen.
2253,3,3,39,45,1.2,0.08164965809277261,523,i think you misunderstood. i said would you like to monkey around
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,Rainforest Cafe....Thank God we didn't go to Hooters!
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,It's an app. It's called Delivery Chimp.
2253,0,9,36,45,1.2,0.06030226891555274,523,Just what monkey business exactly are you referring to?
2253,2,5,38,45,1.2,0.07521014330903551,523,The doctor said that we just have to keep them from jumping on the bed.
2253,1,7,37,45,1.2,0.06816498108607269,523,I told you we shouldn't have opened that barrel!

2335,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,523,Sometimes I miss them jumping on the bed.

2336,1,8,42,51,1.196078431372549,0.06274509803921571,523,"So this is what you meant by ""I love monkeys"" in your dating profile..."
2336,0,10,41,51,1.196078431372549,0.05614831789520141,523,One more and I can actually prove they're cheaper by the dozen.

2336,2,6,43,51,1.196078431372549,0.06871143320758917,523,I hate to inform you that we're out of monkey chow.

2343,1,7,38,46,1.1956521739130435,0.06680829316878904,523,I found No. 12 trying on your makeup in the bedroom. He won't be doing that again.

2343,0,9,37,46,1.1956521739130435,0.05913682829884976,523,I didn't say 'more fun than.' I said 'about as much fun as.'
2343,0,9,37,46,1.1956521739130435,0.05913682829884976,523,Why do you always buy in bulk?

2343,0,9,37,46,1.1956521739130435,0.05913682829884976,523,Do you ever get the feeling like you're being monkeyed with?
2343,1,7,38,46,1.1956521739130435,0.06680829316878904,523,At least we won't have to pay for their college degrees.
2343,2,5,39,46,1.1956521739130435,0.07368535547180384,523,You told me to take care of the mice.
2343,0,9,37,46,1.1956521739130435,0.05913682829884976,523,Good. Acceptance has progressed to the grooming stage so you might want to get undressed.
2343,2,5,39,46,1.1956521739130435,0.07368535547180384,523,I told you never to touch my barrel

2343,3,3,40,46,1.1956521739130435,0.07997321542795012,523,Somehow I thought they would be more shinier.
2343,2,5,39,46,1.1956521739130435,0.07368535547180384,523,This is way less fun than a barrel of monkeys
