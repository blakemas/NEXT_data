2168,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,521,Do you still think we should downsize?
2168,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,521,"When I'm outdoors in the rain, that's when I really need my space."

2168,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,521,You should see the size of the drink I got it from.
2168,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,521,If we live in Seattle we need more than a tote.

2168,2,4,26,32,1.25,0.10040241611281235,521,"""Its sustainable, made up entirely from repurposed batman costumes""."
2168,1,5,22,28,1.25,0.09792827523216718,521,It was hard to find one big enough for my ego.
2168,2,4,26,32,1.25,0.10040241611281235,521,"I bought the ""climate change"" size just in case."

2168,2,3,23,28,1.25,0.11061396718068535,521,I just want to be sure I'm ready if this shower is part of climate change.
2168,2,5,29,36,1.25,0.09236745114890868,521,"Sure, it keeps me dry, but taking it on the subway is a huge pain in the ass."
2168,0,8,24,32,1.25,0.0777713771047819,521,I got this from my donation to the Trump campaign.
2168,2,4,26,32,1.25,0.10040241611281235,521,This jacket is suede.

2168,1,6,25,32,1.25,0.08980265101338746,521,My ex thought I was overcompensating for something.
2168,2,4,26,32,1.25,0.10040241611281235,521,"Yeah, but the slightest breeze..."

2168,1,6,25,32,1.25,0.08980265101338746,521,Do you think it strikes the right note of middle aged whimsy?
2168,0,8,24,32,1.25,0.0777713771047819,521,"Now remember, grab my arm at the first sign of a strong gust of wind and don't let go until we've touched down again."
2168,3,2,27,32,1.25,0.10998533626601496,521,It's not my fault you didn't come prepared. Get out.

2168,1,6,25,32,1.25,0.08980265101338746,521,This must be what they meant by 'shrink-resistant'.

2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,Should we talk about the weather?
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"Say what you will, it's good to be part of an umbrella organization."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Does our umbrella coverage include public embarrassment?
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,On days like this I get sentimental about my time as a paratrooper.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I couldn't resist.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"Expensive, yes, but it doubles as a hot tub."
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,And if it rains hard enough I can flip it over and it turns into a boat.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,Or....We could play golf.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"Honey, now that we are empty nesters, we should really consider downsizing"
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,It's always good to be inclusive.
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,It wasn't this big until I stood next to you
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,I have a very large family.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Really tough getting this back in my briefcase.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"So, we'll just have to find an Uber car with a sunroof; it's still worth it!"
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,Does your insurance provide sufficient coverage?
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,"I call it ""Godbrella"""
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,You laughed when I first bought it but who's got the last laugh now?
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Do you always have to overcompensate?
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,It's worse than you think. The spec we gave the Defense Acquisition guys was for a cocktail umbrella.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"In a stiff wind, it makes me feel like Mary Poppins'."
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,Singing in the rain doesn't do it for me!
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,How many kids do you see yourself having?
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,"Ever since the great cats and dogs flood of '86, I don't take any chances."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,It's how I make friends
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I choose to keep my circle small
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"You know what they say, ""Big umbrella, big feet."""
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,I donated the house to public radio.
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,I also own the largest SUV in its class.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"I bought it at Shaq's yard sale, why?"
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,It's one of those silly promotions for Viagra.
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,It doesn't help with cabs but the double decker buses always stop.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,It's a freebie from my insurance company
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I've been promoted to Risk Management.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"Well, *somebody* has to be the responsible one."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I saved up for a raining day.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,The smile wasn't working so I got this instead.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I only promised it wouldn't rain on you; I never said anything about a parade...
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I see they finally made an umbrella proportional to your ego.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"You can never be to rich, to skinny, or have too much insurance!"
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Were ready in case it rains cats and dogs
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,And this is why we needed the umbrella policy.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"Intimate, environmentally conscious, and far more cost effective than Uber."
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,"Of course, the key to our own happiness is leaving others out in the rain."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"Marty Poppins at your service, ma'am."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Trump left it in my car.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,You never know what you'll find in the subway.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I got this after winning the lottery. . . for all those relatives I didn't know I had
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,"No, you hold it!"
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,I work for Travelers Insurance.
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,I miss your dry sense of humor.
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,"...and I don't usually speak poorly of your family Linda, but I still think your brother is compensating for something with that new truck..."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"This is just the prototype, the finished Poppins 2000 will be come in a variety of colors."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Some do it with cars others with boats. I find that umbrellas are a far more practical way to over compensate
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"Be assured, there's no gap in my umbrella coverage"
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"I agree, Susan. The recent rise in shady umbrella corporations is becoming a large-scale problem."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,It compensates for my little hands.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,In no way is this a metaphor for our marriage.
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"You've heard 'Never shop for groceries when you're hungry'? Well, the same goes for rain gear in a thunderstorm."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"It keeps me dry, but tap dancing is out of the question."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"Clearly, it also repels women."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"With a strong gust, I can do a Mary Poppins."
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,"Yes, but it was just right before the kids all left home."
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,What color is your parachute?
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Mr. Trump will be bringing so many people under one of these fantastic umbrellas.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,You do care about my hair-do
2408,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,521,I come from a large family
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,I'm finding there are some drawbacks to the sharing economy.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,Microphobia my entire life.
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,"You know, it does take HUGE, strong hands to hold up such a large umbrella."
2408,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,521,How did you know I am an insurance salesman?
2408,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,521,I could go for a wet one.
2584,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,521,"Actually, I'm an introvert but it was such a good deal, I couldn't pass it up."
2584,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,521,I don't want to be dry. I want to be an internet meme.
2584,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,521,My insurance agent sold it to me...
2584,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,521,Does this look too macho?
2588,1,6,28,35,1.2285714285714286,0.08286583553358688,521,I guess I have lost a little weight.
2588,2,4,29,35,1.2285714285714286,0.09245225236621893,521,Yes- I actually would melt.
2588,2,4,29,35,1.2285714285714286,0.09245225236621893,521,I have big hands too.
2588,0,8,27,35,1.2285714285714286,0.0720144043214405,521,When it floods we can use it as a boat!
2588,0,8,27,35,1.2285714285714286,0.0720144043214405,521,I got at a patio furniture sale.
2588,1,6,28,35,1.2285714285714286,0.08286583553358688,521,I see it as a cost-free way of maximizing my real-estate holdings.
2594,1,8,35,44,1.2272727272727273,0.07170261260935148,521,But it's STILL always me that ends up getting wet.
2594,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,521,Everything is yuge this year.
2594,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,521,I was expecting more rain AND a larger crowd.
2597,2,3,26,31,1.2258064516129032,0.10063964694019434,521,"I promised to love, honor and always have you covered."
2597,0,7,24,31,1.2258064516129032,0.07633651333031764,521,They call this a small at McDonalds.
2597,2,3,26,31,1.2258064516129032,0.10063964694019434,521,I picked this up on Kickstarter.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,It's a good thing I packed the spare in my brief case. Never know with this weather.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,"Yes Mary, size does matter."
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,"It's a big enough umbrella, but you're still all wet"
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,I'm afraid of cats AND dogs.
2597,2,3,26,31,1.2258064516129032,0.10063964694019434,521,I was raised Mormon.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,Where did they all go?
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,My ex-wife had a big head.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,I have a very generous umbrella policy
2597,2,3,26,31,1.2258064516129032,0.10063964694019434,521,It's an all-inclusive umbrella.
2597,0,7,24,31,1.2258064516129032,0.07633651333031764,521,It's for when it rains cats and dogs.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,I got it from Trump Tower.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,Obama Care
2597,0,7,24,31,1.2258064516129032,0.07633651333031764,521,This is nothing. You should see my rainy day fund.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,This ought to give us some sidewalk space.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,... plus it repels bike messengers.
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,I found it in a cab. n
2597,2,3,26,31,1.2258064516129032,0.10063964694019434,521,don't complain about me not putting a roof over your head
2597,0,7,24,31,1.2258064516129032,0.07633651333031764,521,Don't ask where I kept this.
2597,0,7,24,31,1.2258064516129032,0.07633651333031764,521,"I know, but it's one way we can assert some personal space."
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,"If you have an inkling as to what this might be compensating for, please do tell."
2597,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,521,The audit says we have a large overhead.

3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,I found it in a dumpster. Apparently it had something to do with a Big Tent campaign idea.

3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,It's a pain taking this on the subway.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,I still have this from when I use to shop at the Big and Tall Store.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,I call it the ‘climatizer’. It also serve as a lifeboat for the low-lying areas.

3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,I told you we didn't need the extra-large.

3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,It's still too small for the typical American waistline.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,It's just because whenever I am with you there's a rain cloud overhead.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"Oh, I've had it forever. It was raining, I was in a hurry, so I grabbed it before I slid back down the bean stalk."

3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,I got this at McDonald's.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,I used to be a big-tent guy.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"It's the newest premium gift in our public radio station's spring membership drive. I should've realized that a hybrid rain & beach umbrella might be a bit awkward to use in most instances. At the time, it sounded like such a cool thing!"
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"By the way, I increased our umbrella policy."
3452,2,0,23,25,1.16,0.11075498483890765,521,My therapist tells me I should take more risks.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,You should see my tent.

3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,You didn't know big hands means big umbrella?
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,I made it out of a parachute.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,"It's multipurpose: up for rain, down in a drought, and sideways as a shield against car exhaust."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"I may have small hands, but I have a big umbrella."
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,It was half off.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,Do you have umbrella insurance?
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"Well, they said it's mortgage related, which makes me wonder how well you listened."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,Well they did say rainageddon.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"Hon, don't worry. We're more than covered."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,It's really applicable to everything - Make Umbrellas Great Again.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,They call this model 'The Dugger.'
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,"This is the greatest, most wonderful umbrella, OK, it's a Republican umbrella and it is going to make everything great again, little hands, big umbrella, great again OK."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,I suppose we can both take umbrage in the fact that this day cannot get any worse.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,They said it would rain cats and dogs...
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,Bob explains the unexpected benefit of their umbrella coverage.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"Well, I think it's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,You said you had dryness issues.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,My hope is that one of them will be grateful enough to donate a kidney.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,"Honestly, I picked it out of his trash container! He threw it out during the Primaries, because it automatically opens to a size inversely proportional to the owner’s privates."
3452,2,0,23,25,1.16,0.11075498483890765,521,Amazon 'one-click' still needs some work.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,We use it for choral singing in the rain.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,It's my umbrella policy.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,Have you heard about Traveler's umbrella policy?
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,My therapist says I'm overprotective of women.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"It's really bigger than I can afford, but with Airbnb it pays for itself."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"Yeah I bought it from the family who lived under it, they just never got used to the 'ups & downs' of umbrella living."
3452,2,0,23,25,1.16,0.11075498483890765,521,Where you gonna put it?
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,My wife is extremely fertile.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,You were expecting a parade?
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,I brought it back from my trip to Dallas...
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,Trump said he'd be back in a flash.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,You should see my insurance policy.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,Why is everyone cursing at us?
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,But you ALWAYS tell me that I'm over-reacting!
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,Just wait until it really rains!
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,"The Umbrella store asked if I wanted to ""biggie size"". I said yes."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,It won't be long before we have children.
3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,I know it's out of style but it works.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,"I'm not too superstitious, but it is bad luck to open an umbrella indoors."
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,They offered me a free side of fries if I supersized.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,It's like UberPool but for umbrellas.
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,My big tent campaign isn't working either.

3452,1,2,22,25,1.16,0.09451631252505216,521,what if it stops raining?
3452,0,4,21,25,1.16,0.07483314773547882,521,I got one heck of a deal on this. The salesperson was practically giving them away!
