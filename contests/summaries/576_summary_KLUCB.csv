215,7,25,67,99,1.393939393939394,0.062283526276788556,576,Her Majesty requires an appointment.
215,11,17,71,99,1.393939393939394,0.0685843269166877,576,I'd rather be in the doghouse
215,7,25,67,99,1.393939393939394,0.062283526276788556,576,My healthcare plan dropped acupuncture.
215,9,21,69,99,1.393939393939394,0.06550972272909764,576,... and then one day the beekeeper becomes the beekept.

226,10,17,68,95,1.3894736842105264,0.06905981444629114,576,It beats being Press Secretary.
226,13,11,71,95,1.3894736842105264,0.07376415436075039,576,That dress isn't working. Do you have one with sunflowers or lilacs?
226,10,17,68,95,1.3894736842105264,0.06905981444629114,576,I told you my family aren't typical wasps.
229,6,26,66,98,1.3877551020408163,0.06090808204577228,576,But I didn't lie on my dating profile. I said I was very WASPY guy.

231,12,13,71,96,1.3854166666666667,0.07158878622288199,576,I told you I came from a large family of WASPs.
231,9,19,68,96,1.3854166666666667,0.0668360649352084,576,The doctor said this is the worst case of hives he has ever seen.

231,8,21,67,96,1.3854166666666667,0.06517485197842307,576,Just seeing what all the buzz is about.

231,9,19,68,96,1.3854166666666667,0.0668360649352084,576,"Honestly Honey, the Queen and I are just good friends."
231,11,15,70,96,1.3854166666666667,0.07004038882852852,576,"I would advise against pissing me off, Louise."
231,8,21,67,96,1.3854166666666667,0.06517485197842307,576,What did you think I meant by WASP?
231,10,17,69,96,1.3854166666666667,0.06845697788857924,576,So I guess it's only cool when Jane Goodall does it.
231,9,19,68,96,1.3854166666666667,0.0668360649352084,576,You don't look anything like your profile picture.

255,6,22,63,91,1.3736263736263736,0.06376152082611433,576,But it's in our price range AND it has a great view of the park.
255,8,18,65,91,1.3736263736263736,0.06748282764125625,576,"Well, you don't exactly look like your dating profile picture, either."

266,7,18,62,87,1.367816091954023,0.06763848452873501,576,"If anyone calls, just tell them I'm busy."
266,6,20,61,87,1.367816091954023,0.06563273865215431,576,I got a job with Buzzfeed.

279,6,19,60,85,1.3647058823529412,0.06662546098458755,576,So this dude tells me he has this pill that will guarantee a constant buzz.
279,5,21,59,85,1.3647058823529412,0.06448906889226166,576,Why can't you just buy a pinata like everyone else?
279,11,9,65,85,1.3647058823529412,0.0764167015481461,576,Now you can tell your father that you're engaged to a WASP.
279,7,17,61,85,1.3647058823529412,0.06869544450854602,576,It's time to come out as the raging queen that I am.
279,9,13,63,85,1.3647058823529412,0.07265871032341945,576,I identify as a bee.

279,8,15,62,85,1.3647058823529412,0.07070485231612221,576,I can explain.
279,8,15,62,85,1.3647058823529412,0.07070485231612221,576,To bee or not to bee--I chose the former.
279,5,21,59,85,1.3647058823529412,0.06448906889226166,576,Sorry I haven't called. I've been busy as a ... never mind.
279,3,25,57,85,1.3647058823529412,0.05998846486579746,576,I'm sure I mentioned the hornet's nest in my family tree.

294,7,16,61,84,1.3571428571428572,0.06909557754415957,576,Sigh. This feels like a New Yorker cartoon.

294,7,16,61,84,1.3571428571428572,0.06909557754415957,576,It's not as roomy as some affordable housing options but it comes stocked with food and its own security system.
294,7,16,61,84,1.3571428571428572,0.06909557754415957,576,Honey?
294,6,18,60,84,1.3571428571428572,0.0669875891752801,576,This hammock looked more comfortable in the catalog.

304,7,15,60,82,1.353658536585366,0.07021271765870794,576,Working. You?
304,8,13,61,82,1.353658536585366,0.07232523655871284,576,Why are you always such a buzzkill?
304,9,11,62,82,1.353658536585366,0.07437777870793202,576,I'm part of a sting operation.
304,6,17,59,82,1.353658536585366,0.06803463528798478,576,That's not the question.
304,4,21,57,82,1.353658536585366,0.06345457709467803,576,"When Buzzfeed included free housing in their offer, how could I refuse?"
304,5,19,58,82,1.353658536585366,0.06578447747392063,576,"Yes, I'm Sting. Don't stand so close to me."

304,5,19,58,82,1.353658536585366,0.06578447747392063,576,"It was a steal, but the shared bathroom is always swarmed."
304,1,27,54,82,1.353658536585366,0.05588506945068098,576,The good news is...I don't have tinnitus after all.
304,5,19,58,82,1.353658536585366,0.06578447747392063,576,So much for plan Bee.
317,6,16,58,80,1.35,0.06912655794018842,576,I think they have begun to accept me as one of their own.
317,6,16,58,80,1.35,0.06912655794018842,576,"Just kiss me to break the spell and I'll pay for the bee stings, the Epipen and your Medic Alert bracelet."
317,5,18,57,80,1.35,0.06679839306791514,576,"No, it's not in here. Check your bag again."
317,5,18,57,80,1.35,0.06679839306791514,576,I can't leave now. I just made drone.
317,5,18,57,80,1.35,0.06679839306791514,576,Would you mind getting the benadryl?

317,5,18,57,80,1.35,0.06679839306791514,576,"The bee's knees, my ass...they wanted it all."
317,7,14,59,80,1.35,0.07137882535360719,576,I'm sorry. Could I bother you for a spoonful of Benadryl?
317,5,18,57,80,1.35,0.06679839306791514,576,"You technically get three wishes, but we highly recommend 'don't sting me' for the first one."
317,6,16,58,80,1.35,0.06912655794018842,576,We're just a little busy right now.
317,8,12,60,80,1.35,0.07356216694105258,576,Just because I hang out with other wasps doesn't mean I don't appreciate your temple friends.
317,6,16,58,80,1.35,0.06912655794018842,576,"And so instead of simply trying to save them, I became one."
317,5,18,57,80,1.35,0.06679839306791514,576,I've had just enough of you always being the Queen Bee
331,7,13,58,78,1.3461538461538463,0.07259731851098938,576,Have you seen my yellow jacket?
331,8,11,59,78,1.3461538461538463,0.07485566770783876,576,It's still bigger than a New York studio apartment.
331,6,15,57,78,1.3461538461538463,0.07026642385937759,576,"There's a reason I left you, honey."
331,3,21,54,78,1.3461538461538463,0.0627564285391123,576,"Actually, it's less painful than going back to Washington."
331,5,17,56,78,1.3461538461538463,0.06785550816982638,576,You've never heard of a King bee?
331,7,13,58,78,1.3461538461538463,0.07259731851098938,576,Just keep walking. I'm working an undercover sting operation.
331,3,21,54,78,1.3461538461538463,0.0627564285391123,576,"Say, could you be a dear and grab my epipen?"
331,5,17,56,78,1.3461538461538463,0.06785550816982638,576,"Sure, it's smaller than the other apartments we've seen, but the 24hr security is terrific!"
331,7,13,58,78,1.3461538461538463,0.07259731851098938,576,"But honey, I'm in the middle of an undercover sting operation."
331,8,11,59,78,1.3461538461538463,0.07485566770783876,576,"Well, you don't look like your profile photo either."
341,3,20,53,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06366753442675108,576,"It’s over, I’ve found my queen"
341,9,8,59,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07847813770647384,576,I'm the head of the colony.
341,6,14,56,76,1.3421052631578947,0.0714575854540923,576,I'll move back in the house when your mother moves out.
341,5,16,55,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06895875090187209,576,Has your mother left yet?
341,4,18,54,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06636589585746575,576,Think about how I feel.
341,6,14,56,76,1.3421052631578947,0.0714575854540923,576,"I can't hear you, I have this weird buzzing in my ear."
341,7,12,57,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07387194130325368,576,I said be-HAVE yourself.
341,9,8,59,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07847813770647384,576,Absolutely love the dress.
341,5,16,55,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06895875090187209,576,"I'm just saying, dressed like that you're kinda asking for it."
341,5,16,55,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06895875090187209,576,What if I waive the broker's fee?
341,7,12,57,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07387194130325368,576,"I thought you said, ‘beehive yourself.’"
341,5,16,55,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06895875090187209,576,"Staying busy, how about you?"
341,8,10,58,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07620984782095955,576,"I don't mean to be all weird about it, but I really could use my EpiPen sooner rather than later."
341,6,14,56,76,1.3421052631578947,0.0714575854540923,576,I have to tell you - I don't think a kiss is gonna do it.
341,5,16,55,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06895875090187209,576,"Eat your heart out, micro-apartment hipsters."
341,3,20,53,76,1.3421052631578947,0.06366753442675108,576,Do you have any allergies?
341,7,12,57,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07387194130325368,576,Now you tell me about the birds.
341,8,10,58,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07620984782095955,576,"Well, you don't look like your profile picture either."
341,6,14,56,76,1.3421052631578947,0.0714575854540923,576,I'm through with all the lies and the pretense...I'm a queen.
341,6,14,56,76,1.3421052631578947,0.0714575854540923,576,I wanted to live in a Waspier neighborhood.
341,7,12,57,76,1.3421052631578947,0.07387194130325368,576,Did you bring the EpiPen?
362,6,15,58,79,1.3417721518987342,0.06950951625150825,576,Must I get you out of every sticky situation?
362,6,15,58,79,1.3417721518987342,0.06950951625150825,576,"No, you buzz off."
362,6,15,58,79,1.3417721518987342,0.06950951625150825,576,Don't you think you've taken this 'Small Houses' thing a little too far?
362,6,15,58,79,1.3417721518987342,0.06950951625150825,576,Out there I had no friends.
362,7,13,59,79,1.3417721518987342,0.07180628659345781,576,Do the little dance to show me how to get home.
362,6,15,58,79,1.3417721518987342,0.06950951625150825,576,It's Brooklyn; it's affordable.
368,7,11,57,75,1.3333333333333333,0.07433387871977033,576,When is your mother's visit over?
368,8,9,58,75,1.3333333333333333,0.07671952740916672,576,Still feel like bashing my face in?
368,5,15,55,75,1.3333333333333333,0.06931669932133816,576,"I'll explain later, just go get my EpiPen."
368,6,13,56,75,1.3333333333333333,0.07186908351415902,576,I'll buzz you in.
368,5,15,55,75,1.3333333333333333,0.06931669932133816,576,"Well, nice trick but can you do anything else?"
368,7,11,57,75,1.3333333333333333,0.07433387871977033,576,"Sometimes, the bees keep you."
368,6,13,56,75,1.3333333333333333,0.07186908351415902,576,Never seen a B type?
368,5,15,55,75,1.3333333333333333,0.06931669932133816,576,My profile said I was a Wasp.
368,6,13,56,75,1.3333333333333333,0.07186908351415902,576,Please bring me an epi-pen.
377,6,12,55,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07313067295911857,576,What? I'm nesting!
377,4,16,53,73,1.3287671232876712,0.06772784006480057,576,Who knew man-keeping was a bee thing?
377,7,10,56,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07568760024772044,576,"That's right, I booked it through HairBeeNBee.com."
377,5,14,54,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07048104584672663,576,I also plan to float like a butterfly.
377,8,8,57,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07816092588412643,576,They have accepted me as their queen. These are my people now.
377,4,16,53,73,1.3287671232876712,0.06772784006480057,576,'Money'? I thought you said get off your butt and make some 'honey.'
377,3,18,52,73,1.3287671232876712,0.06485786626183465,576,I think I might be adopted.
377,8,8,57,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07816092588412643,576,I finally feel at one with nature.
377,5,14,54,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07048104584672663,576,"Honey, when you said there was a queen inside you, I had no idea."
377,6,12,55,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07313067295911857,576,"What do you mean, ‘Tinnitus is the least of my issues’?"
377,6,12,55,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07313067295911857,576,They'll never accept you because you're Catholic.
377,5,14,54,73,1.3287671232876712,0.07048104584672663,576,"Home, I'm honey!"
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,Sorry I can't hear you. I have this constant buzzing in my ears.
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,It's a sting operation.
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,Remember when I was your queen?
389,7,9,55,71,1.323943661971831,0.07710727818451199,576,I may have misrepresented myself on JDate and for this I apologize.
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,"Since you ask, I'd really like it if you'd bring me my epipen."
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,I'm pretty much completely off grid now.
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,"You're no queen, Helen."
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,To bee or not to bee-- I'm still deciding.
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,"Believe me, it wasn't easy."
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,What'd you expect? The Cheshire cat?
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,What else can I do to prove Russia's involvement?
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,Please don't give me away. I'm part of a sting operation.
389,7,9,55,71,1.323943661971831,0.07710727818451199,576,Pretend you didn't see me. It's a sting operation.
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,"Honey, what did I say about bothering me at The Man Hive?"
389,7,9,55,71,1.323943661971831,0.07710727818451199,576,The Queen invited me.
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,"""...so I laughed and said, 'No, I don't believe in magic,' and, well, here we are."
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,I realize that seeing me like this must sting a bit.
389,3,17,51,71,1.323943661971831,0.06584735682878701,576,Can we at least agree that the children will be raised as pollinators.
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,Really bad case of hives.
389,7,9,55,71,1.323943661971831,0.07710727818451199,576,What do I have to do to get you to stay away from me?
389,8,7,56,71,1.323943661971831,0.07967400351397719,576,"Loraine, the best way to effect change is from inside the system."
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,Shhh...I'm playing hive and seek.
389,7,9,55,71,1.323943661971831,0.07710727818451199,576,No. I said I was feeling hornet.
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,"Hi, I'm Burt. I have a cosmetic line you'll love."
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,"Honey, this isn't what it looks like.."
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,I can't wait to be an empty nester.
389,2,19,50,71,1.323943661971831,0.06271730155560007,576,"I'm not avoiding you-I've just been really, really busy."
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,I serve a new queen now.
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,Did you kill the spider?
389,3,17,51,71,1.323943661971831,0.06584735682878701,576,This may sting a little.
389,1,21,49,71,1.323943661971831,0.05942260030909574,576,"I told you to take it easy on the ""Burt's Bees"" products. Now look what happened."
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,"I can safely say, ""Honey I'm home."
389,3,17,51,71,1.323943661971831,0.06584735682878701,576,"Well, if I did have a body and if I didn't live in a beehive, would you go out with me?"
389,7,9,55,71,1.323943661971831,0.07710727818451199,576,That is the question.
389,3,17,51,71,1.323943661971831,0.06584735682878701,576,It gives me a real sense of community.
389,5,13,53,71,1.323943661971831,0.07169869855988086,576,"I'm not going to the doctor. It's one hive, not hives."
389,2,19,50,71,1.323943661971831,0.06271730155560007,576,"That's not what I meant by ""Plan B"""
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,What makes you think that I don't want to talk about it?
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,Then I told the genie that I wanted to have a queen and thousands of servants.
389,6,11,54,71,1.323943661971831,0.0744521179154911,576,"You were right, honey. That buzzing sound I kept hearing really was all in my head."
389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,Have they left yet.
389,7,9,55,71,1.323943661971831,0.07710727818451199,576,"Now listen carefully. Go into my laboratory and bring me the formula for ""attracting money"". I think there may be a typo."

389,4,15,52,71,1.323943661971831,0.06883522999350791,576,"It's small, and temporary, but the rent is too low to pass on, and I really feel part of a community here."
433,7,9,56,72,1.3194444444444444,0.07616181215688536,576,I'm simply saying 'Don't quit while you're a head.'
434,4,14,51,69,1.318840579710145,0.06999194212295723,576,I'm afraid I have a natural tendency to drone on.
434,6,10,53,69,1.318840579710145,0.07583789871267847,576,I think I preferred the dog house.
434,6,10,53,69,1.318840579710145,0.07583789871267847,576,Your mother will handle the birds part.
434,4,14,51,69,1.318840579710145,0.06999194212295723,576,This is still better than being in the house with your mother.
434,5,12,52,69,1.318840579710145,0.07297348437377056,576,Maybe YOU'RE a disembodied face protruding from a hornets' nest.
434,4,14,51,69,1.318840579710145,0.06999194212295723,576,"You know, ""Hive Mentality"" is a lot more nuanced than people think."

1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Turns out the second B in Airbnb doesn't stand for 'breakfast.'
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Sometimes dear, I want to be the queen bee."

1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Susan, am I high or just buzzed?"
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Next time I'll just go with the allergy shots.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Would you get me some calamine lotion, honey?"
1650,3,1,34,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0912631693795409,576,Does this hive make my nose look big?

1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I guess the initial attraction was getting hooked up with a real queen.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Of course you are still my queen.

1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,I tend to break out in hives.

1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Tiny space, mediocre school district, slight insect problem -- but wow -- take a look at this view."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,It's symbiotic. They give me honey and I do their taxes.

1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Honey, can you grab me the Benadryl?"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Pardon me, is this the house at Pooh Corner?"
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,It seemed safer than dealing with the kids.
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,Don't even think about it.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Does this branch look too tight?

1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,Not only did they cut off my head they put it in with all these bees so I'm getting stung like a motherfucker.
1650,3,1,34,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0912631693795409,576,Can you hand me my epipen?

1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, and you?"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I'm embracing my WASP heritage.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,What? You knew I was a W.A.S.P. when you married me.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Go ahead, lean in."

1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Idiot! I said you're a WASP, not a wasp."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Except for the buzzing it's very restful.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,It's hard being a WASP these days.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"It soon became clear that Robert was only interested in Gwen's body, or more specifically the flowers pictured on her dress."

1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,I'm sweet for that flower print.
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,"For this illusion, I used more smoke than mirrors."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"""I never promised you a Rose Garden."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Mike, 32 Entrepreneur. ""Avid golfer and rock climber. Work hard play hard. Nantucket summers. Alpha Phi Alpha forever!"" *sighs and swipes left*"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Bee happy, honey."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,And I'm allergic to humans.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Yes, we do need a queen. I'll buzz you in."
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,You just gonna stand there or are you gonna come in and vote?
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,You said you wanted an adventurous outdoorsman.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Natalia, are you sure Don Jr's wants a party pinata? It is really, really great. The country really needs this party."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Some ladies like waspy guys.
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,"Honey, it's none of your beeswax, now head home."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,That's a bad case of the hives.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,The circus closing stung more. What's a contortionist to do?
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,It doesn't always have to be a frog.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"I'm Jewish, but I've always wanted to be a WASP."

1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,She gets me.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"The inside buzz is he's bored and plans to resign or be impeached within six - eight months, maybe sooner if he can figure how to fabricate CNN's role in either event."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I got tired of being your pinata.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Miss, you've got the knees and I've got the bees. Now all we need are the birds."

1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Hard to hear you with all the buzzing in my ears, dear."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"On-line, you didn't admit to being a WASP."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,How did you get that bee sting lips look?
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,But I thought you said we should catch a buzz together
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Yes, it's true. I'm your birth mother."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,The ad just said 'gets to work directly with the Queen.'
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Just a moment, I'll see if she's in."
1650,3,1,34,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0912631693795409,576,"The grocery store honey is perfectly good, Dave."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Honey, have you seen my keys anywhere?"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"So the ""Man on the Moon"" is fun, but the ""Guy on the Hive"" freaks you out?"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Still working on your nest egg I see......
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Stop calling me ""honey""."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"$12,000 a month with no utilities but it has park views and good schools."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,... and it's rent-controlled!
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"No room here, this is strictly a WASP neighborhood."
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,I had to know what all the buzz was about.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Buzz
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Not until you call me Honey.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,...and then tell Spock to throw Mr Scott in the brig.

1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,Are you telling me to buzz off?
1650,3,1,34,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0912631693795409,576,"Did you borrow my comb, honey?"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Don't worry—it's organic.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"This is good-bye, Denise. The queen and I have ... ouch! ... something special."
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,Now all we need is the birds.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,What? So now you don't like outdoorsy guys?
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,My summer home is in the Hamptons.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,They brought back the TV show 'Queen For A Day'. And I won!
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"I hate to say it, but you were right."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"I'm sorry honey, but the place looked bigger on AirBeeNBee."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Hold on, I'll buzz you up."
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,They respect my space. I'm hung but never stung.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Are you ready to bumble?
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,My hives are acting up.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"You're very sweet, but the answer is No."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Help! I've fallen into a wasp's nest and I can't get out!
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,It's not what it looks like.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I thought you were joking when you said you lived in wasp neighborhood.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"Honey, Freud would say the hornets nest is a metaphor for our relationship and the absence of my body indicates you are dreaming"
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,I have been very busy lately.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,If you can't beat 'em...
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Ok, you've pulled yourself together, but you still have a bee in your bonnet."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Smaller than we're looking for, and way too busy."
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,We met on Bee-Harmony.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Couldn't I just sleep on the sofa or in the doghouse?
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,I look on them as pets
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,"A bee in my bonnet? No, quite the reverse!"
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,I don't know. How did any of us get here?
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,I was looking for my yellow jacket.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"You've really gone method for your stinging rebuke, haven't you?"
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,I've moved on to Plan B
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"""Not to be"" was never really an option."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,So I did buzz off.
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,"Yes, I did get your text but did you forget I really can't text you back."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"I told the genie, I wanted to be good in the sack."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,Just mind your own beeswax.
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,Can't you see I'm busy?
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Bee with me.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"I don't care what you say. In our relationship, I'm the Queen bee."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Just hanging out. You?
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"It's not so bad here, the rent is cheap and lots of free food!"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,This isn't what I expected when I signed up for Bumble.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"No, it's not a bonnet."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Oh, you said beHAVE"
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I got it on airbnbee
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,The Queen and I have an understanding
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"For honey, Honey."
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"The bigger question is, how do I get out?"
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,It has a sweet view of the park.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,You said you'd leave me if I didn't get us more honey.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,I told you I was a WASP on our first date; remember?
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I think I figured out what the buzz is all about.
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,"You said, ""BEHAVE?"""
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Couldn't you just put me in the doghouse?
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"...but honey, they're our kind of people...White...Anglo Saxon...Protestant...."
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I wear my yomacfa so they know I'm not a Wasp
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,Why can't you just let me be?
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,You told me I need to learn more about the birds and the bees.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"I can't, they made me Queen."
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,Believe me when I tell you.
1650,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,576,You're still my queen.
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,I'm Anne Bolyn .. bee headed awhile ago .
1650,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,576,"Oh, there you are. Do you think this dress makes me look fat?"
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,This conversation is making me uncomfortable.
1650,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,576,"I wanted to what ""the buzz"" was all about."

2719,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,576,"We could make a bid on it, or we could just wait to see if there's a die-off."

3128,0,3,25,28,1.1071428571428572,0.05952380952380955,576,Don't worry. The hive's gender neutral and I've been chosen as their queen.
3128,1,1,26,28,1.1071428571428572,0.07866756984761514,576,Honey is an excellent moisturizer.
3128,1,1,26,28,1.1071428571428572,0.07866756984761514,576,I was thrown off Twitter. Now I have to buzz on Hive.

3128,1,1,26,28,1.1071428571428572,0.07866756984761514,576,I self identify as a queen bee now.
3128,0,3,25,28,1.1071428571428572,0.05952380952380955,576,"It's not you, it's me. I just have a hard time getting close to people."
3128,0,3,25,28,1.1071428571428572,0.05952380952380955,576,I got a sublet.

3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Hi Honey, hive got a lot buzzing around in my head today, can we talk later?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"No. ""Why would you ask if I have been smoking weed?"""
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"They drained the swamp, so here we are."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Does this make me look fat?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"No, I said you should ""behave"""
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,It's supposed to be great for your skin.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Yes. I was lying when I said I wasn't a wasp.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I assure you this is 100% organic.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Please say you'll bee mine.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Hive sight is 20/20.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I'm hiding from the Customs and Border Protection
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,They swarm you'd come back to me.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"As long as Trump is in the White House, I'm safer in here."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Come into my hive. We'll get buzzed.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I guess the hive is breaking out in me.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,You should have realized all along that I am a WASP.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"They like me so much, I took up residence."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Well it's a lot roomier in here than it looks like from the outside.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Couldn't we just get a dog house?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I'm not in a position to argue about it right now.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,My analyst says I'm afraid of people getting too close.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"When I said I'd rather be stuffed into a beehive than go to your parents, I wasn't kidding."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Worst case of hives I've ever had!
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Please bee mine, Honey!"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"You will meet a tall, handsome doctor, who will then treat you for anaphylaxis."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Yas Queen!
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,You feeling the buzz too?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"At least now I know what makes you so ornery, Fred."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Honey , I was looking for honey, then I got stunk and I blacked out...!"""
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"And now, I'm not allergic at all!"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Are you sure this is where you last saw it?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,For god sake honey...in collusion with the bees ?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"You can make fun of the ""hive mentality,"" but, finally, I've got the support structure I need."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I swear baby, you're my only queen."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"It's not so bad, the queen likes me."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,You left out some important details on your dating profile.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,You're dumping me? Well that stings.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Sorry, my Queen says I can't have any visitors after nine o' clock."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I'm their security guard. Go away!
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I would kick myself, but shouldn't."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Don't bee like this.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Because I am a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"For the last time, stop calling me ""Honey"""
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,What's all this buzz about?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I always said you where my honey. Where did you think I get it from?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,It looked much bigger on the website.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"Sorry, I'm only attracted to birds."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,This is how much I hate helping with the laundry.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Admittedly my match.com profile did say that I was looking for a honey pot
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I broke out in hives
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"Sorry, I'm a bit bzzy at the moment..."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Not my dream home, but it would be crazy to give up a rent-controlled apartment."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"What I said at the party, Neil, was 'BE-HAVE' yourself!"
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"They have better knees, that's why."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,They say its good for your skin
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,- Give me a kiss - Give me a buzz
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Have you heard the buzz about me?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"After I told them I belonged to a tony country club, attended the Episcopal church and went to a prestigious boarding school, they invited me in."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I'll let you talk to Junior about the birds.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I heard you're looking for some honey. You're in luck because I am too.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Two bees or not two bees; that is the question.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,You wish to know what from the mighty Bee-Keeper
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,This can't be bad...
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,They decided to List it.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I guess my chronic hives in the previous life carried over into this life.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Honey, the bees said I can stay the night. Can I, can I?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Most people would have taken the meeting .
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,You have your bridge club and I have this.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I was once a princess too.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I'm getting into character to play Robert Redford in The Sting.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"the buzz is, no pain no gain"
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"You know I appreciate your commitment to sourcing locally, Herman, but..."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"After that explanation of the bees, how will you explain birds?"
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,This isn't the spelling B
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I like the bee gees too !
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I am one with the bees.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,In a past life I was a peacock.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Don't knock it, it's a natural buzz."
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,There is nothing funny about it.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I don't know, honey, it's a bit cramped for a 500-bedroom."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Have you heard the expression, 'Bee in your bonnet'?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,none of your bees-ness
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I'm just more comfortable here than inside with your mother.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,Let me know when the buzz wears off.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"""I warned you I was into honey""."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I'm sorry, the Queen can't see you right now. Give us a ""buzz"" to make an appointment."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Tell your parents I am beezy.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"You take birds. I'm doing a demonstrative presentation on bees for little Joey, honey."
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,Last thing I remembered was sniffing the lilacs.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Oh behave, honey"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Honey, why are you hiding in that beehive?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I knew you were going to take this personally.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,The honeymoon's over.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I finally decided: to bee.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"No, not a wish! I was just thinking..."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,This is the only way to ensure it's organic.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I already tried the birds.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I asked for a beehive at my hairdresser's.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I just want you to call me ""honey""."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Marsha, will you bee mine?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,If I fell for you we'd both get stung.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"What do you want, honey?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I heard you can attract more fly honeys with bees.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Honey, I think we need to talk your shrink about exposure therapy."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,But you told me to beehive myself.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,It still stings less than counseling.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I'm sorry for leaving you and the kids ,but I have returned to my roots as a wasp"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,So when is your mother leaving?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,You're not the only one that likes to be treated like a queen.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I want you to bee with me, honey."
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,I thought I'd give Bumble a try.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I'm sorry, you'll have to speak louder. I have a terrible buzzing in my ears"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,You said we're DONE—mind your own beeswax.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Take solace, dear Ellen, in knowing that we all have clearly defined roles."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,It's the latest buzz
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I'm not going to drone on about it, honey. Suffice it to say that I've got to BEE me."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Let me tell you about the Burt and the bees.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,There's only one queen.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I just prefer it here, that's all. I'll be back the minute your parents leave."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"So near, but yet so far."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"I swear, if you kiss me I turn into a prince."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I just wished I could be your honey.
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"Hi there honey, wanna hang with me?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"""You Tube will show me how,"" you said. Wait until you see the video I make of you in there!"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Honey, where are the birds?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Are you the Queen Bee?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Is it over?
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"And don't call me ""Honey""."
3962,1,0,24,25,1.08,0.08,576,"You're totally harshing my buzz, babe."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"It takes a bee to know a ""B""."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,The doc said I have hives.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,The queen has abdicated. I was asked to be the temporary regent.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"...well, for me 'not to be' was never an option. You know?"
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Honey, we have to talk."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,I asked for a buzz cut.
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,"Once you get the hang of it, it's really comfortable."
3962,0,2,23,25,1.08,0.055377492419453826,576,Have you read Hamlet?
