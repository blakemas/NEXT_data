40,1,3,4,8,1.625,0.26305214040457564,511,What next? Some sort of machine that blows it out of the way?
40,1,3,4,8,1.625,0.26305214040457564,511,"No, thanks. It just needs a trim."

40,1,3,4,8,1.625,0.26305214040457564,511,Don't laugh. I escaped from prison this way.
40,2,1,5,8,1.625,0.3238992347717331,511,I'm very good at micromanaging.
40,1,3,4,8,1.625,0.26305214040457564,511,Because that's Daddy's 401(k) shovel.

58,2,0,5,7,1.5714285714285714,0.36885555678165877,511,Sometimes a snow shovel is just a snow shovel.
58,1,2,4,7,1.5714285714285714,0.29738085706659045,511,"Dad, is there a moral in this?"

64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,I’ll use it after Mommy’s family leaves.
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,You can't use that. We're Amish.
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,I charge by the hour.
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,Great! I'm almost done now. Where were you three days ago?
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,"Yes, the snow shovel would be faster. But global warming has been linked with using those."
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,Get a smaller shovel. We're creating jobs.
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"""...Then use this micro shovel for more intricate detailing of your shoveled path.. Got it?"
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,It's the journey.
64,0,5,4,9,1.5555555555555556,0.1756820922315766,511,Mine's a gift from my cardiologist.
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,You missed a flake.
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,This way is more artisanal.
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,I was hired by the hour.
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,Your shovel will get smaller as you get bigger. Mine did.
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"Ok, Son...Daddy's turn to be middle manager."
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,"Shoveling is a journey, son, not a destination."
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"Since last Sunday, and you?"
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,It is all in the knees.
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,Have you found your brother yet?
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"Son, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to let you go."
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"It's not snow, it's a metaphor for how the 1% pay taxes."
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,...and that's how Social Security works.
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"On average, they're both perfect."
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"Mathematically, we should finish at exactly the same time."
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,Keep looking. I know grandma's out here somewhere.

64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,"Remember son, use this shovel when they're paying you by the hour."
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,I get paid for each shovelful.
64,2,1,6,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2939723678960656,511,"Thanks anyway, kid, but I get paid by the hour."
64,1,3,5,9,1.5555555555555556,0.2421610524189263,511,"And this, my son, is how to make the most if you are paid per hour."
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,"I'm union, kid."
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,I could have used you three weeks ago.
97,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,511,The joy is in the journey.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Anyone can move snow. It's only a true artist that can shape it and let it tell it's own story.
97,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,511,You remind me of Jeb!
97,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,511,"It's not the size of the shovel, it's how you use it."
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,This debunks that myth…size doesn't matter.
97,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,511,What matters is how you use it.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,It's all about the technique.
97,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,511,"I told you; low weight, high reps!"
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Switch?
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Little goes a long way.
97,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,511,"Your grandfather, the archaeologist, taught me how to shovel snow."
97,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,511,Still wanna take turns?
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Because your father is a trained archeologist.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,When I was a kid we shoveled the walk both ways.
97,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,511,Help! Having...tiny...heart attack....
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,"Yes, the whole lawn! That's why you have the BIG shovel!"
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,And once the edges are perfect I like to finish up with some 100 grit sandpaper
97,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,511,It's a matter of perspective.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,I charge by the scoop.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,You sound like your mother. It's not about size.
97,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,511,This spatula turned a retirement job into a retirement career.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,"See, it's easy. Just step, lift, turn, toss."
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,"Bar mitzvah, bar shmitzvah, Neil; today you are a man."
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Sometimes being paid by the hour is a good thing.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,I have less character to build.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Maybe bigger is better.
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Optical Illusion #10 - The shovels are the same size!
97,2,0,6,8,1.5,0.32732683535398854,511,"I saw it on ""Escape from Alcatraz."" What's your excuse?"
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,Where's your baby sister with the snowblower?
97,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,511,See! It's not the size of the shovel that matters!
97,0,4,4,8,1.5,0.1889822365046136,511,"Thanks, but I'll be done in a couple more days."
97,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,511,The groundhog lied.

132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,No thanks. I'll stick with the one I've used since I was eight.
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,"Because when I started, all I could find was 'Malibu Barbie's beach shovel'"
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Quit complaining! When I was your age, we didn't even have shovels."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,What do you mean I'm a micro manager?
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Watch me carefully, son, I'm about to teach you the value of pointless toil."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,And you promise we can switch after ten minutes?

132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,"Yea, but when i'm done it will be spring."
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,"It may be small, but I know how to use it."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"You ARE the best snow shoveler in the whole, wide world, Tommy! Now can we trade back?"
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,It helps if you bend at your knees.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"If you wanna make some big money, you need to charge by the scoop."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"I named my shovel ""El Nino"""

132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,Earl was determined to prove that size doesn't matter.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,The union won't let us use that one.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Thanks, Jimmy. I'll take it from here."

132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Snow, stocks, life, whatever. It's all about leverage."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,I get paid by the hour.

132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,I suppose you're going to tell your mother about this?
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,I was wrong. It doesn't build character.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,Lift with your legs.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Because they're paying me by the hour, that's why."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,You call it unfairness. I call it seniority.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,Why use that when I've got this app on my phone?
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,It's what you do with it that counts.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Well son, size matters"
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Shovels don't clear sidewalks, people clear sidewalks."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,Shoveling is like making love. But I forget why.
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,Put that thing away. I get paid by the hour.
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,"Thanks, son. But I prefer this one as a metaphor for my life."

132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Son. The key to success, is to do more with less."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Everyone, son, has their own path and their own journey."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"No Dad, not until you tell me where babies really come from."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"When you get older and have kids, you too can be unfair."
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,The path of least resistance? Never heard of it.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,""" What ever you do don't let mom know you found it""."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"It's not the size but how you use it, son!"
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,I'm not sure what the lesson here is anymore either.
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,A good worker never blames his tools.
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,That hole was meant for the next door neighbour's kids
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Here, dad, try this one."
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,My character is sufficiently built .
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,It's not the size of the shovel...
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Darn, that's not our house."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Don't look so smug, I charge by the hour."

132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,How much more demonstration do you need?
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,I'm paid by the hour.
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,So how do you like Canada so far?
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"And that, son, is the history of Social Security."
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Hey, I let you pick first."
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,When I was your age I was twelve feet tall.
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,"Nice job with the walkway son, we will switch shovels again before your mother gets home."
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,I have no idea why your mother says I'm always doing things the hard way.
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,"Son, you'll never get a government job with that kind of thinking."
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,I prefer small-batch shoveling.
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,"Okay, son, it's your turn."
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,"And no, you will not be getting a participation trophy."

132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,this is Trump-onomics in action
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Sure, but my way builds character."
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,Want to trade again?
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,Did I complain when you got first pick on lawnmowers?
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,"Put that away, Son. We're getting paid by the hour."
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,Does this shovel make my butt look big?
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,"Technically, I don't think we're violating any OSHA rules."

132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,Yes it's lighter but I'm doing more reps
132,0,4,5,9,1.4444444444444444,0.1756820922315766,511,"Work smaller, not harder."
132,2,0,7,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2939723678960656,511,"See, it's how you use it that really counts"
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,Now you come?
132,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,511,"Because I'm management, that's why."
213,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,511,"I wanted a more hand-crafted, artisanal look."
213,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,511,"Son, as I told you, size doesn't matter."
213,0,3,4,7,1.4285714285714286,0.2020305089104421,511,"You've got the driveway shovel, so get started!"
213,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,511,Is that shovel big enough for you?
213,0,3,4,7,1.4285714285714286,0.2020305089104421,511,"It's not the size of the man, it's his equipment."
213,1,1,5,7,1.4285714285714286,0.29738085706659034,511,No thanks--I've joined the slow movement.

221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"No thanks, I'm good. I've got kind of a Zen thing going on here."
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,It's not the size-it's the motion.
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,I get your drift.
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,It's a Daddy heart attack preventer.
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,Objects are larger than they appear
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"Some is good, more is better, my dear."
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,My snow removal incentive plan is based on the number of shovelfuls.
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,"Because you haven't had two heart attacks, that's why!"
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,Laugh all you want but the Fitbit won't lie.
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,I told my wife that I would help out around the house after I finished shoveling.
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,"Because, Timmy, I'm much more detail-oriented than you are."
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"I appreciate your effort, son. But the sidewalk is over here."

221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"The right tool for the right job, Son. Now go see if you can find the driveway."
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,It's not all about size.
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,Let's just stick with the plan.
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,"See son, contrary to what your mother might say, size doesn't matter."
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,Before my operation that was my shovel.
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"Brownie, you're doing a heckuva job."
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,You kids are always rushing to get things done.
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"Remembering back, Jack realized that his father always found ways to make him feel small and incompetent."

221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,I thought this was taking more time than usual
221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,I'll stick with mindless persistence.

221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,Dad there's something wrong with this picture!
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"You know, son, it wasn't too long ago, that I would have needed that big shovel for a job like this. Now I can do it all with my smart phone."
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,It's not the about destination it's about the journey
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,My doctor said 'no heavy lifting'

221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,The doctor suggested smaller portions.
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,Put some elbow into it.
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"Remember son, it's not the size of your shovel that counts."

221,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,511,"That's not cardiologist approved, son."
221,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,511,"No, you can use that one. I don't mind."

314,1,1,7,9,1.3333333333333333,0.23570226039551584,511,Take this job and shovel it.
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,Faster.
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,Think of it as preparation for the 2036 Winter Olympics.
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,I'm good at detail. You're a big-picture guy.
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,I suppose you want a participation trophy.
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,Kids these days are so spoiled.
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,But the flakes are so small!
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,Do ya wanna trade?
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,Did Tom Brady complain about the size of his shovel when he was drafted in the sixth round?
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,"No son, I said ""bring me the blow dryer""."
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,"Thomas, you look tired? Would it be alright if Daddy uses the big shovel for a while?"
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,Really pushing for that inheritance aren't you?
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,Just grip a little further back on the handle.
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,I can't wait for this 'Freaky Friday' thing to get undone.
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,I suppose you're still using a landline too.
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,Someday you'll understand -I work for the city...
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,This cross-training thing isn't working.
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,I told you: size isn't everything.
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,Isn't it your nap time?
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,"Thanks, but your mother isn't always right."
496,1,0,6,7,1.2857142857142858,0.28571428571428575,511,"In my day, we cleared the snow from miles of sidewalk with just a spatula."
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,"As a matter of fact, ""YES"", I am trying to make a point."
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,"Yes, but see I get paid per hour."
496,0,2,5,7,1.2857142857142858,0.18442777839082938,511,This sucks. We need to join the tiny house movement.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I accidentally brought my Florida sand shovel.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Are we having fun yet?
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Now who's laughing at my shovel app?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Son, the hourly worker needs to pace himself."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"If you know so much about shoveling snow, why aren't you doing it?"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Aren't you the same kid that offered to shovel my walk two weeks ago?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,No thanks--I've downsized.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"When I was your age, we used our hands for shovels!"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,How many more houses?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I'm wearing my fitbit.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Son, please don't question my mid-life crisis..."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Someday you will understand and appreciate the difference in ""hourly wage"" and ""salary wage"""
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,The shovels are the same size. It's just an optical illusion.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Thanks, but I’m looking for Mom’s wedding ring."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Sunny Boy! A credit card on a popsicle stick is all you need!
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"When I was your age we had to shovel our way to school, two miles each way — uphill in the snow!"
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Sure, son, we can go sledding, but let Daddy finish his chores first."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Where were you nine hours ago?
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,So how much powder DOES the washer take?
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,The weather forecast did call for a chance of erasers today.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,My normal job? I work for the government.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Sure, now you show up..."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Flick the wrist, Jr. Flick the wrist."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,The key is to lift with your legs...
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Remember kid, it's not the size of the shovel, but how you use it."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Tell your Mom that I am not being stubborn.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Sure, it takes longer, but artisanal small-batch shoveling leaves each sidewalk truly unique."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Remember, son, it's not the size of your shovel but how you throw the snow!"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Go tell Mom she made her point; size does matter!
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"God loves a lonely hero, son..."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Stop saying your thing is bigger than my thing!
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Stop sighing. I'm doing my bit.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Mine was that size when I was your age.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"You know what they say about men with big shovels, don't you?"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Downsizing.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,It depends on your perspective.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I said I liked the 'concept' of role reversal.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"As I told your mother, bigger is not necessarily better."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,... and that's why they call it Management.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I'm an archaeologist. Why do you ask?
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Er, thanks, but I prefer the Conservative approach."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"No more ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"". Ever!"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Well, at least I have one important thing bigger than you."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Size doesn't matter. It's the enthusiasm that counts.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"I guess it's true, it's not the size of the shovel, but the size of the shoveler !"
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Nope.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Be ready with my chopsticks.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Wrong! Slow and steady does NOT always win the race.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Do you think you've got it now?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Ha ha, yeah that's right ""No place like Gnome!"""
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"I told you, let me do the edges first."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"You'll understand when you're married, Son."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,At least you can use yours as a sled.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Don't just be a Yard Gnome, get to work!"
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"And when it all melts, I have a shot glass you can use to clear away the flooding."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Yes Son, nothing seems as it was since Trump."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Piece of cake, son. Why don't you finish up."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,You must be from the Dept of Public Works.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Thanks son but this allows for a more chiseled look
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,You don't think salt will do it?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Put your back into it.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Oh, is this what you were looking for, Dad?"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,If I upgrade to the larger one I may get stuck holding it for 4 hours
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"It's the journey, not the destination, that matters."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,We get paid by the hour you know.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Archimedes would have loved this.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,The inverse-square law is real.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Good system. One full shovel for you, one for me."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,I think your right. In this case size does matter.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Size isn't everything. Ask Mom.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,It's all relative.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"I'm doing cardio, not strength training today."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Yeah...well you tell Mommy that Daddy will use the regular shovel when he finally sees bacon back on his breakfast plate
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Just more proof that size doesn't matter.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Shoveling my way to the store. Need anything?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Like I tell your Mom son, bigger is not better."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Picasso didn't shop at Sherwin-Williams, Billy."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"That's not a shovel, this is a shovel."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,You shoveled the heavy snow now let me handle the light snow.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Hey, I borrowed your ice cream scooper."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Where's the challenge in that?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Put some muscle into it, son. Like this."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Things seem bigger when you are young. When you are older it will seem small.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Since I only get you on the weekends, I need to be creative with the character building exercises."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Son, smaller shovels equals fuller employment."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"It’s not that hard, you’ve just lost your perspective."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Hey dad! Mom told me to bring this to you. She thinks you are avoiding her!!!
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,It's not quantity. It's quality.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Smarter not harder? Where do you come up with these things!
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Can you get me the salt shaker?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I charge by the hour not the job.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Think of this as a virtual demonstration.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,It's not the size of the shovel that counts. It's what you do with it that matters the most.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Its' called trickle down economics.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Are you going to ask it to Prom or are you going to finally help out here?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"As you grow older, it just gets smaller."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Hey, I thought I told you to pick up a shovel at the union hall!"
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"We make a great team, son!"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"You see, Jeremy? Size doesn't matter!"
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Oscar, run inside and get Daddy the salt shaker."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,My purpose? My purpose is to make a man of you.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Is that what they've been teaching you at that fancy school of yours?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Remember, my boy, it's not the size of your shovel but how much Elvis is in your pelvis..."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Can we trade back now?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Pathfinder. Please.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"I'm a southpaw, so your right-handed shovel is useless to me."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Well... you can tell your ""real"" dad that your mom is very pleased with my little shovel."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Ok, Eugene. Size does matter."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Thanks, but this is my way of avoiding election coverage."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,It's the spoon nine out of ten escaped convicts recommend
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,The cold truth about perspective.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Hey kid, get off my lawn."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Honey, like I always tell you, it's not about the size."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Why, yes - I am a lawyer."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Complain softly and carry a big shovel.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,This is almost as frustrating as the New Yorker caption contest
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"When you grow up, I promise you can use the little shovel."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,You have to follow through. Like this.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"""Get out of the well. Stop playing with that ceiling roller and give me a help""."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Your mother says she thinks you might be gay.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Is it big enough now Edith?
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"It's not about the size of your shovel son, more in how you use it."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,I got it at a convenience store in the city. They weren't allowed to sell me anything larger.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"NOW, you find the shovel?"

519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,A shovel? Why didn't I think of that?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"No, Tommy. Today we're working on your fine motor skills."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,You're doing a great job Brownie.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,See how easy it is? It's all in the wrist.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,It's not about size.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Son, remember quality trumps quantity when offering bespoke snowflake removal services."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,This must be what it's like to enter the New Yorker cartoon contest.

519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,See. It doesn't matter how big it is.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Dad, remind me one more time how Socialism works !"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Remember, I get first choice of beach umbrella."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,First one to shovel out the car gets to drive.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,So now they're making iShovels bigger?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I think I've made my point how ridiculous our 2-party system has become.

519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Sometimes, size really doesn't matter."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Don't believe women who tell you that size doesn't matter.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Next you will be demanding a snow blower.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,What did you say about switching shovels?

519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Sisyphus who!
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,I would swap shovels with you but my sciatica wont let me.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,You should join the union.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I really don't want to go to work.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Wouldn't you say we've lost our sense of perspective?
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"No matter what your mother says, size does matter."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Who says that size matters
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,okay that's a big shovel and all but seriously where did the sky go
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"I told you when we met, I'm a beach person!"

519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,... it's what you do with it.

519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Sure?! Now you find the shovel!!!
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"It's not the size of the shovel, it's how you use it that matters."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,I guess not everything is too big to fail.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,It's not the size of your shovel but what you do with it.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"My, aren't we passive-aggressive today."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Because the hard way builds character, Timmy."
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,See? The cold DOES cause shrinkage.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"You're a shrewd trader, young Thumb!"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Get ready to come back in; I've almost finished the touch-up work.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"No, this is not what I meant by ""division of labor""... This is what I meant by ""Job Security"""
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,The problem is you are always looking for a shortcut.

519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"This is one of those perspective puzzles, right?"
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,It's all about the reps.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Trust me. In time you'll live to make moments like this last.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Put that thing away, we charge by the hour."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Just five minutes and then I get the big boy shovel again.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,Don't fall into this overachiever trap.
519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"From each according to their ability, to each according to their need."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,Son when I was a boy my father didn't help me with snow removal.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"Remember son, it's not the size of the shovel in a man's hand, it's the size of the man holding the shovel."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,See son? I told you it's not the size that counts.
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"""Your mother said we should be spending more time together""."

519,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,511,"Son, I know it takes a little longer but I find a spatula to be more precise."
519,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,511,"You see son, this is socialism. This is why Sweden is covered in snow."

716,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,511,Switching our shovels just before Mom looks out the window never gets old.
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,And this is what would happen if Washington bureaucrats told us how to live our lives son.

716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,"I believe in quality, not quantity."
716,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,511,"Told ya. It's not how big it is, it's how you use it."
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,Because I'm proving to your Mom that size isn't everything.
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,Apparently you don't know how to use yours.
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,"Technique, my boy."

716,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,511,It's not the size of the tool that matters.
716,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,511,"Sorry, but I need the small shovel for precision digging."
716,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,511,Showoff!
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,"It's because I expect big things of you, son."

716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,Where do I get one of those?
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,So... you working for scale too?
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,"It's not the size of the shovel, but the speed in your heave."
716,1,0,8,9,1.2222222222222223,0.2222222222222222,511,A bad workman always blames his tools.

716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,This is one of those Goldilocks moments.
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,When I was your age we didn't have big shovels. We had garden trowels AND WE LIKED IT!
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,I prefer incremental change.
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,"I'm not shoveling the snow, I'm looking for my keys!"
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,Your mother doesn't want me hurt. Only humiliated.

716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,I'm proving a point to your mother.
716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,It's all in the wrist action.

716,0,2,7,9,1.2222222222222223,0.1469861839480328,511,"When you get bigger, you can have this shovel."
