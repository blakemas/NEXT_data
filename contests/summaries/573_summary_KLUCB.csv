1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"They said I can't ""drink"" beer while in the hospital."
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,It's all our insurance would cover.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,How is THIS a drinking problem?
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,The doctor told me to stop drinking beer.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,I promised you no alcohol shall ever pass through my lips again!

1629,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,573,"We're not covered for blood, so they put me on a Dr. Pepper drip."
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"For starters, no, ""Critical Condition"" does't mean you finally get to freely comment on my choice of beverages."
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,It was the nineteenth inning and the last thing I remember was being out of brewskis.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"I don't know why, but I feel like I have an explosive headache."
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"Yes, it's beer, but it's gluten free."

1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,One of them is vodka. The other is orange juice. I could stay here forever.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,I had to use my wellness days and I had a case of vodka about to expire.
1629,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,573,"Yes, it's awkward, but it's better than my old hearing aid."
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,What?!
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,"Miller Lite, of course. Why do you ask?"
1629,0,11,44,55,1.2,0.05443310539518172,573,"When you promised not another drop would touch your lips, I didn't expect this."
1629,4,3,48,55,1.2,0.07521014330903548,573,Apparently anesthesia is not covered in my new health plan.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,Fortunately I also have full coverage on the catheters.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,The doctor said it's all in my head.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,Turns out I'm low on IPA.

1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"Thanks, mom. What else have you got in that bag?"
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"It's a pretty serious case, so it's strictly prescription-strength brewsky for me."
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,This was the only way I could stop the slurping.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,Turns out the surgeon was in my college fraternity.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,I think Narragansett lager would work better!
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,And she wondered for a moment why she'd ever thought having his jaw wired shut would slow down his game day consumption.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,Yes! I can hear you now!
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"No it's not the carrot juice infusions Christine, I only have popped out eyes for you!"
1629,0,11,44,55,1.2,0.05443310539518172,573,They call it an IVA.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,I wish. It's just drip coffee.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,"Hospitals are getting crushed with this ""patient satisfaction"" stuff..."
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"My heart says one thing, but my head says another."
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,Who knew? Cold beer is good for fever.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,didn't you hear? Redbull gives you wings.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,The doctor said my IPA level was too low.
1629,0,11,44,55,1.2,0.05443310539518172,573,Will this make me right-handed?
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,It's only until I'm allowed to use my tongue again.
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,It's always just in one ear and out the other with you.
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,Craft Brewed is the latest therapy

1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,"I was hesitant at first, too. But it's all in-network!"
1629,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,573,"It's Republican health care. Instead of opioids, they prescribed a beer hat."
1629,4,3,48,55,1.2,0.07521014330903548,573,Who won
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,The specialist stated it was 'exophthalmos' and that was a real eye-popping diagnosis!
1629,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,573,"Wow! When you frown, the feedback loop speeds up - awesome!"
1629,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,573,I told them my blood type was IPA.
1629,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,573,"Wait, isn't this what ""draining the swamp"" means?"

1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,They said liquid diet only
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,The doctor says it's not technically drinking. It is intravenous fluids.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"goes in one ear, out the other"

1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,And the nurse says I can have as much ice cream as I want!
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,Doctor's orders. Did you bring the chips?
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,They misunderstood me when I said pop ran in my blood.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"Mind running to the vending machine for me, honey? I'm feeling a little light-headed."
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,Just be happy I don't need a quadruple bypass.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,I was at a tailgate party. It was all they could find.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"Well, we should have seen this coming when they announced the new 'Foxworthy' wing at the hospital."

1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,Don't look so surprised dear! This is improving my night vision.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"Dear, I feel like my head is about to explode."

1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,I told you I needed a beer.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,We're just going to have to get used to having Christo in our neighborhood.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"No, two a day is good for you."
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"It's called "" Psychodialysis""."
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,The doctor said I needed plenty of fluids.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"I have a confession, my love. I am a Coke addict."

1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,What? It's V8.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,These Cancun hospitals sure are cutting edge.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,"The doctors said it was almost ""Game Over""."
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,Honey...It's the only man-flu treatment out there that exists.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,My new doctor is a sports medicine specialist.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"Recovery is a marathon, not a sprint"
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,Now all I need is a pretzel catheter.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,i don't think this doctor knows what he is doing
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,These beer I.V. tubes haven't cured my alcoholism or my liver failure but they've done wonders for my social anxiety disorder.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"No, it does not make you look like an elephant."
1898,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,573,You might be a redneck.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,I feel fine but the doctor said there were complications with my hysterectomy.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,Turns out my doctor is a sports fan too
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"They asked me if I preferred a traditional IV pole or the new ""Redneck Drinking Team"" option."
1898,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,573,I requested the Bose headphones but our plan didn't cover that.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"I DON'T KNOW, THE DOCTOR SAID HEAL THYSELF"
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,How else do you think I get my liquid courage?
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,Not enough oomph in the blood.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,I STILL don't like Wagner!
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,Of course it was a male nurse.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,Another Obamacare Lie
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"This give new meaning to ""brain drain""!"
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"It's the Giants, babe. It's the Giants."
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,..and you laughed at me when I bought this drinking contraption! Who's laughing now!
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,Bros before HMOs.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,I think we need to rethink your choice of a sports medicine doctor...
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,IV poles recalled. Failed tip-test again...
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,It's the new colonoscopy prep.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,I'm really looking forward to the seventh inning stretcher.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,"YOLO, babe."
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,I'm looking for better mental health coverage.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,We need to find a way to sneak this out come check-out!
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"On the other hand, the copay is quite low."
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,Is this really a good idea post-liver transplant?
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,"Like most of us, Dear, you just don't understand the power of statistics. Of course I'll be a better painter!"
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,"Before we talk about my will, I just wanna give a shout out to the Budweiser Health Insurance..."
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,"Yes, but we're saving $37.72 per day"
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,I'm scheduled for an early discharge.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,I could have bought all this crap for a third of the price on line.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,Um...'My health insurance doesn't cover anesthesia'?
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,The surgeon is my fraternity bro.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,I cannot hear you.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,You knew it was happy hour.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,"""I feel my head's about to explode""."
1898,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,573,Size doesn't matter to me Frank
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,They call it medical two-fisting.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"Oh, and my catheter goes into the other 2 beer cans in the rotation"
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,My doctor is a millenial
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,Got a match?
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"Fortunately, the EMT was an old college frat brother who could see what I needed."
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,It's not bad... There is almost always a game on.
1898,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,573,Tailgate party and colonoscopy. It's a win-win situation.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,What? I'm an alcoholic.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,The one on my left is liquefied pizza. The other is beer. Party time.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,I quit drinking
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,Only the left side is a pre-existing condition.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,I imagine I have much bigger hands since my treatment began.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,The doctor said you're better off with this beer addition than that opium thing.
1898,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,573,Hospital cutbacks.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,At the 7th inning stretch I get a sponge bath.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,"No honey, I'm Detoxing..."
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,I never really liked the taste of beer.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,It's the new 13 Step Program.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,My insurance only pays for domestic.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,I LOVE this place. Wait until you see their cure for gambling.
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,I've looked at life from both sides now. It's win and lose and bzzzzzzzt somehow.
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"Calm down, I know beer would kill me. That's why I refilled them with vodka."
1898,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,573,"Doctor says, two of these a day and I'll be good as new."
1898,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,573,Moving my arms keeps them charged. You can't even see the hearing aids themselves.
1898,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,573,And you said the America Care Act wasn't for the common man.

2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Nothing is plugged in or attached so I guess it's nothing serious
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,"Forget exercise, this gets the blood flowing."

2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Stay thirsty my friend.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,"Doctor said since they couldn't get that contraption off your head, they might as well use it."

2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"Beer and electroshock therapy, I'm feeling a lot better!"
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"Really dear, this is not a convincing argument for beer therapy."
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,They said I'm ready to go home now.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,I should have upgraded to Bluetooth enabled arms.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,"I know it sounds scary, but Stanley Cup fever is actually very treatable."

2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,The doctor warned me against going cold turkey.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,I've stopped self-medicating.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,It's a combination satellite radio and intravenous therapy. It's called Lite Rock for Drips.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Out one ear and in the other
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"The theory is, if I have bad thoughts about Trump, my hands will grow to normal size."
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Doc diagnoses it as a 'right brain vs. left brain' problem.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"I'm sorry dear, that this set-up lets everyone know my deepest thoughts, but that IS an ugly hairdo."
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,This is what they do when your bed is a timeshare.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,So now you know my inner self. Is there still a chance for us?
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,I finally reached my deductible.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Now if we can just switch these things to dark roast.
2706,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,573,I could use a change of bed pan.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"This gives a whole new meaning to the expression ""beer me""."
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,And if you tell them 11 they drop a shot in on each side.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Why do we have to pay for a hospital room so you can use your earwax recycler?
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,I was told this would be the best way to cure my hangover
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"Nothing shocks me anymore, dear."

2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"I swear this is legit .... they call it the ""tailgate"" treatment."
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Doctor gave me three keggers to live.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,Did you say your doctor was wearing the same thing?
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,"It's called a 'brewski delivery system for the prehensilly dwarfed'. I know it seems awkward, but why should we small-handed guys be deprived a cold beer at the end of the day?"
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"Don't worry dear, it's decaf."
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,The doctor said I need to drink less...
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,They've upgraded my mono.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,I'm afraid they're saying it's more advanced than just mono.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,The last thing I remember is Freddy saying 'Let's head into the game.'
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,"See mom, the frat has a killer health care program!"
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,I like it here.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"As you can see, they had to perform an emergency double beer-pass."
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,It's a traditional folk remedy from the Jets people.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,Just in case the left doesn't know what the right is doing.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,It's cold brew
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,I love to hear my pulse
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Don't look at me like that you cunt.
2706,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,573,Extra-marital biofeedback
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,And my catheter empties into a keg.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,I've perfected our coffee drip.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,It's a precaution in case I go jogging in my sleep.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,It's still quite experimental--the Schlitz-Bud transfusion.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,I felt that this IV was right up my alley.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,I wasn't ready for some football.

2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,"Sure it's big on flavor, but it's less filling!"
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,This has to be the fastest way to get my wiiings.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,You're beautiful.
2706,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,573,Call the nurse. My beer drip needs replacing.
2706,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,573,Say that again and my head will explode.
