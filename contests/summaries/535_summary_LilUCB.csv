733,7,19,74,100,1.33,0.060394327113353526,535,"Fine, but you're cleaning up after it."
733,11,11,78,100,1.33,0.06674994798166929,535,What? I let you take the stray cat home.
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,"If a cop pulls us over, try 'Call me Ishmael'."
733,9,15,76,100,1.33,0.0636515133481927,535,Now will you call me Ishmael?
733,5,23,72,100,1.33,0.05695115752497349,535,"When you said lets ""Save The Whales"" I didn't think you meant it literally."
733,7,19,74,100,1.33,0.060394327113353526,535,I still think the aquarium is going to notice he's missing.
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,What can I say. I'm a sucker for garage sales.
733,9,15,76,100,1.33,0.0636515133481927,535,I got it at Costco.
733,6,21,73,100,1.33,0.05869799439039248,535,"I figure if we can keep him alive, children will be no problem."
733,5,23,72,100,1.33,0.05695115752497349,535,"I'm sorry, but this is going to be your last ride with Uber."
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,Love that new car smell.
733,5,23,72,100,1.33,0.05695115752497349,535,I've got to stop and pick up some krill.
733,12,9,79,100,1.33,0.06824643402827549,535,Can you switch the radio over to sonar?
733,7,19,74,100,1.33,0.060394327113353526,535,"I'm driving slowly because when it's wet, this car tends to fishtail."
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,"Usually, a ""whale"" of a deal doesn't mean a real one."
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,"Sure, be that way. But it works out to, like, two cents a pound."
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,I don't know what to do now that he's outgrown his carseat.
733,9,15,76,100,1.33,0.0636515133481927,535,You were supposed to take only memories.
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,I found him ontop of my brother on the desert island. I couldn't just leave him there.
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,"Next time, can we just bring a salad?"
733,11,11,78,100,1.33,0.06674994798166929,535,I know it's starting to smell but this way we can use the HOV lane to beat traffic.
733,10,13,77,100,1.33,0.0652191333393457,535,Now we have to talk about the elephant in the bedroom.
733,6,21,73,100,1.33,0.05869799439039248,535,Will a black lab sing to you?
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,I think next time we should go back to our regular car wash.
733,8,17,75,100,1.33,0.06204429828352442,535,He said we should call him Ishmael.
784,7,19,75,101,1.3267326732673268,0.05988257633678194,535,We can't avoid it any longer. We need to talk about the whale in the car.
785,6,20,73,99,1.3232323232323233,0.05889850398833636,535,Not in front of the W-H-A-L-E.
785,7,18,74,99,1.3232323232323233,0.06062323676075036,535,I'm getting a little annoyed that you keep calling him the fish.
785,6,20,73,99,1.3232323232323233,0.05889850398833636,535,"You realize, don't you, that no one will believe us about the one that got away?"
785,5,22,72,99,1.3232323232323233,0.05712171836331741,535,Ten cents a pound.How could I pass it up!
785,8,16,75,99,1.3232323232323233,0.062300239956487445,535,Do you have a better idea to qualify for the carpool lane?

785,9,14,76,99,1.3232323232323233,0.06393326960137292,535,"Well, next time you try to get a sitter on a Friday afternoon."
785,5,22,72,99,1.3232323232323233,0.05712171836331741,535,"I've tried everything, even one of those little pine tree thingies."
785,7,18,74,99,1.3232323232323233,0.06062323676075036,535,"Actually, the expression is ""elephant in the room."""
785,4,24,71,99,1.3232323232323233,0.055287861646949536,535,"I thought it would be more effective than a ""Save the Whales"" bumper sticker."
785,10,12,77,99,1.3232323232323233,0.06552561350500853,535,"Seriously, he's normally not like this, it was that last shot of Drambuie in the blowhole that did him in.."
785,8,16,75,99,1.3232323232323233,0.062300239956487445,535,I thought carpooling would be a lot more fun.
785,8,16,75,99,1.3232323232323233,0.062300239956487445,535,"The salesman said it was a hatchback,not humpback."
785,7,18,74,99,1.3232323232323233,0.06062323676075036,535,Did anything seem weird about that car wash to you?
785,4,24,71,99,1.3232323232323233,0.055287861646949536,535,"I didn't know the Aquarium's ""Adopt-A-Whale"" program was so literal."
785,8,16,75,99,1.3232323232323233,0.062300239956487445,535,I wonder if Costco carries krill?
785,7,18,74,99,1.3232323232323233,0.06062323676075036,535,Wasn't this in last weeks cartoon?

785,7,18,74,99,1.3232323232323233,0.06062323676075036,535,OK big fella. You know the rules. This car does not move till all the seat belts are clicked.

948,4,21,70,95,1.305263157894737,0.05614268378878064,535,I think it's time to change the air freshener.
948,9,11,75,95,1.305263157894737,0.0653591751147031,535,"Hey, it's only a metaphor."
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,Looks like he's moving in for the krill.
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,Your profile said that you liked pets!

948,10,9,76,95,1.305263157894737,0.06705062220000578,535,did you remember to fill the pool?
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,"Honey, did you forget to pack the krill?"
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,I just couldn't put her in a kennel.
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,This Save the Whales thing is a lot harder than it's made out to be.
948,3,23,69,95,1.305263157894737,0.05411133686459363,535,The check engine light is on again.
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,"Well, that's the last time we go on vacation to Nantucket."
948,3,23,69,95,1.305263157894737,0.05411133686459363,535,I am not trying to back out. It's just that when you said that you wanted to save the whales I thought it was more of a financial proposition.
948,9,11,75,95,1.305263157894737,0.0653591751147031,535,"Costco sure has some great deals, huh?"
948,4,21,70,95,1.305263157894737,0.05614268378878064,535,So don't you want to hear about the one that got away?
948,9,11,75,95,1.305263157894737,0.0653591751147031,535,It wasn't me either.
948,4,21,70,95,1.305263157894737,0.05614268378878064,535,Enough about my sperm count already!
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,Next time you'd better order an UberXL.
948,8,13,74,95,1.305263157894737,0.06362277584278245,535,I promised to help with his pod-cast.
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,"For dinner, so far we have one vote for krill."
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,You guys feelin' sushi?
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,"I hate to say this, but I liked this song better on the album."
948,4,21,70,95,1.305263157894737,0.05614268378878064,535,Pull over. We're supposed to keep him rear-facing until age two.
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,I've always wanted a car with big tailfins.
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,"Yes, it's cramped, but it has a 5-star rear-impact safety rating."
948,9,11,75,95,1.305263157894737,0.0653591751147031,535,What fishy smell?
948,3,23,69,95,1.305263157894737,0.05411133686459363,535,"For the last time, it's mother was NOT going to come back for it any minute."
948,8,13,74,95,1.305263157894737,0.06362277584278245,535,"I get ""Save THE whales"" but ""Save THIS whale"" is a bit much."
948,4,21,70,95,1.305263157894737,0.05614268378878064,535,I picked him up hitchhiking outside the Sea World parking lot.
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,No honey..... I said pick me up with the HATCHback.
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,I still can't figure out where that smell is coming from.
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,I am not cleaning it. Or the car.
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,He was blubbering so badly I just had to give him a lift.
948,8,13,74,95,1.305263157894737,0.06362277584278245,535,"Don't look at me, you chose Uber Pool."
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,"I've been driving the speed limit, but someone's been riding my tail since we left San Diego."
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,You used to like Moby when we were dating.
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,I'm told it's a perfectly acceptable housewarming gift in Japan.
948,4,21,70,95,1.305263157894737,0.05614268378878064,535,I couldn't leave him stranded.
948,10,9,76,95,1.305263157894737,0.06705062220000578,535,The next time you get a whale of a deal talk to me first.
948,4,21,70,95,1.305263157894737,0.05614268378878064,535,Are you sure Costco sells krill?
948,8,13,74,95,1.305263157894737,0.06362277584278245,535,"Once I accepted the ride request I had to take him, or it would have killed my driver rating."
948,5,19,71,95,1.305263157894737,0.05810305593288958,535,Is the car fishtailing?
948,8,13,74,95,1.305263157894737,0.06362277584278245,535,"I said it was a deal for a whale, not a whale of deal"
948,3,23,69,95,1.305263157894737,0.05411133686459363,535,"Fine, I'll talk about it."
948,8,13,74,95,1.305263157894737,0.06362277584278245,535,What a fluke!
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,"I know, I know, but look at what we saved!"
948,8,13,74,95,1.305263157894737,0.06362277584278245,535,See? You couldn't do this in a Tesla.
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,When I said our car was too small to carry a whale in the back seat I was only joking about your mother. Your family takes things so literally.
948,9,11,75,95,1.305263157894737,0.0653591751147031,535,"Would you please quit nagging - it's always Jonah, Jonah, Jonah..."
948,7,15,73,95,1.305263157894737,0.06183763773146141,535,My mistake. I told Siri to reserve us a hatchback.
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,Your Tinder said whale of a time! Not time with whale!
948,6,17,72,95,1.305263157894737,0.05999941061772172,535,"If I stop saying the word sperm, can we keep him?"
1038,9,11,76,96,1.3020833333333333,0.06475289004365635,535,"Then roll up your window! The point is, we won't have to go back to Costco for three weeks!"
1038,9,11,76,96,1.3020833333333333,0.06475289004365635,535,I told you I had a big dick
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,What makes you think I don't know what I'm doing?
1040,8,12,74,94,1.297872340425532,0.06386790595182304,535,"Okay, Okay..I didn't realize it said ""come have a whale FOR a time"""
1040,8,12,74,94,1.297872340425532,0.06386790595182304,535,No! I was not talking about your mother. We literally have a whale riding us.
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,What does woooowwooeeeeewonnmmmwwwaaarrmmmoooeeee mean?
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,It's a carpool.
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,So is this a hybrid?
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,As if the 600 pound gorilla in our living room wasn't bad enough.
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,"I know, I know....and stop calling me Ishmael"
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,"Yes ,I have heard of catch and release, why."
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,Think of it as saving them one whale at a time.
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,Let's see if he likes the car wash better.
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,It seems our 'Whale On Board' sticker has made zero difference.
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"Well, it's too late to throw him back now!"
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,I’ve had enough of his singing.
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,"You just had to prove that you can ""speak whale."""
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,How are we on krill?
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"He's tailgating us, I swear."
1040,3,22,69,94,1.297872340425532,0.054177545289954394,535,"Well to be fair, you did bring back a lot of seashells."
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,we should have let this one get away
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,"Oh, come on! We stopped for krill not more than 5 minutes ago."
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,Next time let's just go trout fishing.
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"Before we address the elephant in the room, there's something more pressing I've been meaning to talk to you about."
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"Well, which is it--are we not picking up hitchhikers, or are we saving the whales?"
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,"Look, it's Uber. And no, I don't have to explain."
1040,8,12,74,94,1.297872340425532,0.06386790595182304,535,"Well, now's a hell of a time to find out you're allergic."
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"You left plankton in the trunk again, didn't you.?!"
1040,8,12,74,94,1.297872340425532,0.06386790595182304,535,"Sorry for the odor, ma'am, but due to budget cuts Greenpeace will be using UberPool for whale relocations."
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,It's my new echolocation system. My GPS is on the fritz.
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"You know, I still think you should have just gotten a t-shirt."
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,It's our first date. We should be talking more about YOUR interests.
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,We should only buy fish at Costco if we are having company.
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,"After this one I promise, I'll go vegan"
1040,8,12,74,94,1.297872340425532,0.06386790595182304,535,Maybe we should have gotten a cat.
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,Don't look at me like that. You said you wanted a 'rescue'!
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"I said on my profile that my memoir would read like ""On the Road"" meets ""Moby-Dick."" I feel like I was pretty clear."
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,We're not getting anywhere near the gas mileage the dealership promised.
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,"I swear, the ad said it was a hatch-back."
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,"... whale kabobs, whale creole, whale gumbo, pan-fried, deep-fried, pineapple whale ...."
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,What did you think I meant by carpooling?
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,This way we don't have to carpool with Larry.
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,"Well, you brought home that stray kitten last week"
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,"Sorry, we stopped for krill an hour ago."
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,"We usually don't pick up hitch hikers, but you don't seem like a killer."
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,Why is this guy tailing me?
1040,5,18,71,94,1.297872340425532,0.05824746872144231,535,The humpback is much more eco-friendly than the hatchback.
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,"The way he wiggled his tail at me... I just couldn't say ""no""."
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,Does this mean I have to call YOU Ishmael?
1040,4,20,70,94,1.297872340425532,0.056249329000888804,535,Now we can use the HOV lane.
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,Climate change.
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,"I'll admit, when the salesman said it had a Humpback Seat, I had something completely different in mind."
1040,7,14,73,94,1.297872340425532,0.06205101781007094,535,"Wake up honey, I just went through a big puddle."
1040,6,16,72,94,1.297872340425532,0.060179300526514684,535,"So now we have an elephant in the room, AND a whale in the back seat."

1589,3,16,67,86,1.255813953488372,0.05532158567646684,535,This certainly tops anything else we've done in the back seat.
1589,3,16,67,86,1.255813953488372,0.05532158567646684,535,What happened to wanting a rescue dog?

1589,4,14,68,86,1.255813953488372,0.05774145523777671,535,He was stranded on the beach. So we pick him up and take him to the nearest marine park. They'll fix him up and release him back into the wild. What's the worst that can happen? It's not like he's some bison from Yellowstone.
1589,4,14,68,86,1.255813953488372,0.05774145523777671,535,"He keeps saying, ""This is all so Kafkaesque."""

1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,It is not unprecedented. Someone took a young bison from a national park just last summer.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,I can't wait to see that show off try to filet this.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,seal level rise is worse then I thought
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"I'm telling you Jonah, I think we have this thing backwards."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,I thought I was buying a hatchback.
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,"I promise, it's just for one night."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"You distinctly said, ""Show me a whale of a good time."""
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,I spy with my little eye....
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,"I told you to rent a ""hatchback""."
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,"Fine, go ahead and blame it on autocorrect, but how was I supposed to know that you meant ""hatchback?"""
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,We really need a backup camera.
1713,1,19,64,84,1.25,0.05045689127585228,535,So much for the small pond theory.
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,"How far ya migratin', stranger?"
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,"No to the tender strains of the humpback mating call? Ok then, would dinner and a movie put you in the mood?"
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,I am giving him a lift just to school
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,What are we going to say we used for bait?
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,This should be enough blubber to last us through the Trump administration.
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,"Now I just need to stop by the store for 10,000 pounds of krill."
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,I never thought we'd be watching him for this long.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"Well, call me Ishmael."
1713,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,535,"I will never, ever drive a minivan."
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,"No, we're not at the beach yet!"
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,He's not quite as majestic above water.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"I know you're skeptical, but trust me. The kids are going to love it."
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,"Ever since I put on that bumper sticker that says 'Honk if You Love Krill', this has been happening."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"On the phone, you said you didn't mind sharing your Uber ride."
1713,3,16,69,88,1.25,0.05421135926495693,535,Something's fishy around here.
1713,7,7,70,84,1.25,0.06532280056069527,535,What a back sea driver.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"Don""t you long for the days when the only thing in your tank was a tiger?"
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,We can't just give our son a goldfish. His fifth birthday is too important.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,I think it's time we talked about the blue whale in the car.
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,I think Whole Foods probably knows what it's doing.
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,Is that Greenpeace following us?
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,Your sure the whale sounds CD isn't enough to get you to sleep?
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,Does your radio get any lower frequencies?
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,"You really can't beat the warehouse store prices, even if you're getting a little more than you need."
1713,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,535,"So, we have to buy a bigger fish tank. Big deal."
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,"If you ask me, a whale in the back seat is a heck of a lot worse than an elephant in the room."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,It will make a change from tilapia.
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,Next time let's use a different car-pool app.
1713,1,19,64,84,1.25,0.05045689127585228,535,Yes I'm sure there will be leftovers.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"When I was talking about bringing a whale home, I was talking about your mother."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"Well what's wrong with calling him ""Ishmael""?"
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"Seriously Edna, there's nothing back there"
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,It's just for the weekend.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"I don't see why we can't take him with us once in awhile. We're a family, dammit!"
1713,7,7,70,84,1.25,0.06532280056069527,535,You wouldn't let me have a dog.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,And at home its 'the elephant in the room' you won't discuss!
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,He says he lost his pilot fish.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,"They aren't the tailfins I had in mind, but I like them."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,What? You said I could get one thing from the gift shop.
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,Uber doesn't play favorites.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,Looks like I get to buy that big new grill!
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,I feel like our relationship has alot of dead weight
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,You can tell Captain Sonar I know the way from here.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,We're the first on our block to own a humpback hatchback.
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,Call me Lyftmael.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,I read that echolocation is the new GPS.
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,"Because I like the smell of the ocean, okay?"
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"I know you don't understand, but we were stranded on an island together a couple of weeks ago, so we're like brothers now."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,What's that smell?
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,At the time teaching him how to live outside his tank and giving him room to grow seemed like a good idea.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,Another Tailgater.
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,Do we have to take your mother with us everywhere?
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,We did what you wanted to do last weekend.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,"""I told you when we met that I was super serious about saving them."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"Now, that was a true all-you-can-eat seafood buffet."
1713,2,17,65,84,1.25,0.05322367527583983,535,"""I think he wants us to pull over""."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,Maybe we should rethink sushi night.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,For sushi takeout you can't beat the serving size.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,"No, I said this car was echo friendly."
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,"You're right, I think we do need a new air freshener."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"His singing soothes me in traffic, OK?"
1713,2,18,68,88,1.25,0.051745902770176135,535,You just HAD to have a souvenir.
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,And you said we'd have a whale of a time...
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,Read the fine print before clicking Submit.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,YOU tell him he has krill breath!
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,Perhaps we should re-consider our position on hitch hikers
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,Where am I going to get 5 million pounds of plankton?
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,"When they offered a whale of a deal in a used car, this isn't what I expected."
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,""" Well , at least we know my sperm count isn't the issue "" ."
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,We can't go--she hasn't fastened her seat belt yet.
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,Did you remember to pack his squeakie toys and the karaoke machine? We can't expect your mom to entertain him ALL week while we're gone.
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,I'm starting to think you were right that we should have just had kids.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,Look on the bright side: we can use the HOV lane the whole way home.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,"Honey, see if there's any of that krill left in the glove box."
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,I am not avoiding the elephant in the room.
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,So where the hell am I supposed to get 100 kilos of plankton?
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,It creates more downforce and therefore provides better traction. Why do you ask?
1713,6,9,69,84,1.25,0.06308887810420712,535,"No, I said humpback, not hatchback."
1713,6,10,72,88,1.25,0.061012871862545205,535,Just drop me off at 19.896` N and 155.582`W.
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,Can we tone down the nonverbal communication?
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,"Well, you could stand to lose a few pounds yourself!"
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,Whales must be really easy for cartoonists to draw.
1713,4,13,67,84,1.25,0.05836508438405425,535,We should have rented at least a mid-size.
1713,5,11,68,84,1.25,0.060772895338321996,535,Is this what you meant by whale watching?
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,I can't wait until he's old enough to drive himself.
1713,3,15,66,84,1.25,0.05585357054399395,535,"If you say ""whale of a tale"" one more time........"
1837,4,13,68,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05774929481166006,535,"I'm pretty sure he wasn't drowning. You didn't need to ""rescue"" him"
1837,5,11,69,85,1.2470588235294118,0.060125644246543875,535,Should we poach it or grill it?
1837,5,11,69,85,1.2470588235294118,0.060125644246543875,535,It's closer than you think.
1837,5,11,69,85,1.2470588235294118,0.060125644246543875,535,"Believe me, it's HUGE!"
1837,2,17,66,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05267596189542411,535,'Humpback.' 'Hatchback.' You can see where I got confused.
1837,3,15,67,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05527086941984991,535,We're gonna need a bigger aquarium.
1837,4,13,68,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05774929481166006,535,He's decided to take a 'gap year' between the Atlantic and the Pacific.
1837,3,15,67,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05527086941984991,535,He insisted I take him out for some sushi.
1837,4,13,68,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05774929481166006,535,Wouldn't it be easier to download humpback whale songs?
1837,4,13,68,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05774929481166006,535,"I know it's misleading, but the Shell station does not sell krill."
1837,3,15,67,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05527086941984991,535,"If it's sushi grade, we're set for life."
1837,1,19,65,85,1.2470588235294118,0.049946420460231636,535,"No one is going to believe us, so let's keep it a secret."
1837,2,17,66,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05267596189542411,535,Right Ralph. You got another whale of a deal.
1837,5,11,69,85,1.2470588235294118,0.060125644246543875,535,I feel like we've forgotten something. Did you turn off the oven?
1837,5,11,69,85,1.2470588235294118,0.060125644246543875,535,"Honey, did you remember the chips?"
1837,3,15,67,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05527086941984991,535,This model is available with hatchback or humpback.
1837,5,11,69,85,1.2470588235294118,0.060125644246543875,535,"You said if I caught a big one, you'd clean it!"
1837,3,15,67,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05527086941984991,535,"Clearly we don't agree on what a ""whale of a time"" means."
1837,4,13,68,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05774929481166006,535,I don't mind him tailing us. I just hope he doesn't breach.
1837,2,17,66,85,1.2470588235294118,0.05267596189542411,535,"Right whale, white male; what's the difference? We're both endangered."
1857,2,16,65,83,1.2409638554216869,0.053086795805151125,535,It's all part of Sea World's new public relations program!
1857,2,16,65,83,1.2409638554216869,0.053086795805151125,535,At least we can ride in the carpool lane
1857,3,14,66,83,1.2409638554216869,0.055785896507344584,535,It's hard on mileage but we can use the carpool lane.
1857,4,12,67,83,1.2409638554216869,0.058360299942670876,535,"Forget the elephant in the room, we have something much bigger to talk about."
1857,6,8,69,83,1.2409638554216869,0.06319526350874098,535,What could I do? He was in a kill shelter.

2141,5,8,67,80,1.225,0.06155937753117162,535,Maybe we should stop grocery shopping at the warehouse store. We'll never use up this fish before it spoils.

2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"But no, you had to bait your hook with krill."
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,Must you insist on calling it a whale of a tale?
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,"Fine, we'll go back to the aquarium and I'll put it back."
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"""Did you by any chance have tuna for lunch?"
2141,5,8,67,80,1.225,0.06155937753117162,535,YOU feel like a fish out of water...
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,Why does he keep calling me Jonah?
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,Look at the bright side. We can open a sushi bar.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,I thought whale watching was done in a boat
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,I told you: there are times when we will need a pickup.
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,"Catch and release, not catch and lease!"
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,You're not going to tell me the big fish little pond story again?
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"Remind me why we pick up hitchhikers at the beach, again?"
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,We did sign up for an authentic whale watching experience.
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,"But your match.com profile said you were looking for someone wanted to ""Save the Whales""."
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,"Technically, he was hitchhiking, not stranded."
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"Maybe we shouldn't have used ""PLANK10"" for our personalized license plate."
2141,6,6,68,80,1.225,0.06407817614623444,535,"Fine. I'll call you Ishmael. Now, can we go home?"
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"I'm sorry you're so upset, Bob, but I'm not going to drive all the way across town just so you can get a plankton latte."
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,"Sure enough, we fishtailed on that black ice."
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,"You know, your dating profile said it was a dolphin."
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,This is much more impressive than a hood ornament.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,You knew I wanted a large family.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,The app said Uber Pool.
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,I thought you only wanted to pick up some sea shells.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,Do you think they have plankton at PetSmart?
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,You don't find it soothing?
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,Did we have to borrow Jonah's car?
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,This isn't the carpool I was expecting.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,You're the one who said we should car pool.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,We've been urging it on our bumper for years; it's put up or shut up time.
2141,5,8,67,80,1.225,0.06155937753117162,535,I can imagine your mom being very comfortable in the backseat.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,I wish for just one summer we did not have to go to the beach.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,Can we squeeze in a visit to the aquarium?
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,We seem to be slowing down since that low water crossing.
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,"Well, how about the Walthers? Their pool is Olympic size."
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"If you say we'll have a whale of a time, ONE more time......"
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,Could you open your mouth a bit so I can back out?
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,Are you sure Petco has 5 trillion krill in stock?
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,Remember when you used to say I was the catch of a lifetime?
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,Now do you regret not getting a sunroof?
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"No, I'm keeping the radio on, Mike. No offense, but your singing puts me to sleep."
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,Does it smell like fish in here?
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,I happen not to care for that new car smell.
2141,5,8,67,80,1.225,0.06155937753117162,535,What I had REALLY wanted... was a Bat-mobile...
2141,0,18,62,80,1.225,0.04698168239870363,535,"I'm sorry, but, yes, your mural over the fireplace has to go."
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"Oh, and I suppose YOU could have gotten us a better deal?"
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,I always wanted a car with big tail fins like my Dad's had.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,Where to now Ahab?
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,You might say he's an out pod-cast.
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,What did you think I meant when I said whale watching?
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,Our mileage has really dropped since we installed those fins.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,It's getting hard to keep up with the Joneses.
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,"Yes, we saved the whale, but it's killing our fuel efficiency."
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,Does it seem to you that this car is doing a lot of fish tailing?
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,All I said was that it smelled like fish in here...
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,Is it strictly symbiotic?
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,The marine biologist said I had 48 hours to return it.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,You'll be more comfortable in your new school.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,"Look, he powers the car and gets us into the HOV lane."
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,I've had left ventricles bigger than this car.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,This is not the kind of whale watch I thought we were going on.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,I never would have expected this based on his Uber rating...
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,You'll be happy we have rear-whale-drive once the rains come!
2141,4,10,66,80,1.225,0.05893302355914539,535,But the shelter threw in a free bag of krill.
2141,5,8,67,80,1.225,0.06155937753117162,535,I want a divorce.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,This is the LAST time I tell you that you can have anything you want while on vacation.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,"""Should we stop and buy a bigger pan?"
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,What happened to the elephant in the room?
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,You said you didn't want a pet you'd have to take for walks.
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,"Another benefit of my Alaska mileage club, honey."
2141,5,8,67,80,1.225,0.06155937753117162,535,This is not a good idea for a SAVE THE WHALES campaign!
2141,2,14,64,80,1.225,0.0532934318037197,535,I have a sinking feeling that symbolism has hitched a ride with us
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,I think we've got a tail.
2141,1,16,63,80,1.225,0.050236781119167954,535,We're going to have to get a bigger pool.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,We can buy a bigger freezer.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"For what it's worth, we're all a little blue today."
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,Think leftovers.
2141,3,12,65,80,1.225,0.056184033048725275,535,"No one thought 'Shark Week' would fly, either."
2267,5,8,68,81,1.2222222222222223,0.06085806194501846,535,"You heard me ask, they don't have the McKrill anymore!"
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,"It was dark, OK? I really thought I was picking up your mom."
2267,5,8,68,81,1.2222222222222223,0.06085806194501846,535,I told you to throw it back!
2267,4,10,67,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05826715823167509,535,Why in the world did you use krill for bait?
2267,2,14,65,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05270462766947299,535,"Well, you can just call me Ishmael."
2267,4,10,67,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05826715823167509,535,I told you we were being tailgated...
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,It was free
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,"I told you we needed an SUV, but nooooo."
2267,4,10,67,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05826715823167509,535,"Lucky thing they didn't check the back seat, huh?"
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,Do you think they will miss him?
2267,4,10,67,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05826715823167509,535,You're kinda being a third whale.
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,"Well Ahab, I guess we can end the search"
2267,5,8,68,81,1.2222222222222223,0.06085806194501846,535,You're sure this bulk shopping will save us money?
2267,4,10,67,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05826715823167509,535,"Steve, stop being a back seat diver!"
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,My doctor said whale sounds would pacify my emotions.
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,...and to what exactly are your referring by 'the elephant in the room?'
2267,6,6,69,81,1.2222222222222223,0.06334307917217434,535,"Ironically, I call him Willy."
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,I really don't think a bigger car seat is the best solution.
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,It better not be pregnant.
2267,3,12,66,81,1.2222222222222223,0.05555555555555555,535,Do you reckon she’s blocking the view of our “save the whales” sticker?

2290,1,15,63,79,1.2151898734177216,0.049897285200852806,535,Which way to the carpool lane?
2290,4,9,66,79,1.2151898734177216,0.05885107394843846,535,"If you're going to sing, could you at least learn the lyrics?"

2290,3,11,65,79,1.2151898734177216,0.056025699103727955,535,Your the one who selected Uber ride-share.

2871,2,10,63,75,1.1866666666666668,0.05265332251978381,535,But no one will believe me if I can't show them the catch.

2871,4,6,65,75,1.1866666666666668,0.059102394986100974,535,We could try to patent the bait.

2871,3,8,64,75,1.1866666666666668,0.055970820368587894,535,... and if you need to sneeze I'll open the sun-roof.
2871,3,8,64,75,1.1866666666666668,0.055970820368587894,535,All we need now is 100 pounds of onion and carrots and a gallon of horseradish and we're on our way towards making the world's biggest gefilte fish!
2871,3,8,64,75,1.1866666666666668,0.055970820368587894,535,I still think we should have thrown it back.
2871,2,10,63,75,1.1866666666666668,0.05265332251978381,535,No one is gonna believe we used a 20 pound fishing line.

2871,3,8,64,75,1.1866666666666668,0.055970820368587894,535,And Consumer Reports claimed that the back seat was too small for adults.
2871,1,12,62,75,1.1866666666666668,0.049112238922818546,535,Why do you always find my excuses hard to swallow ?
2871,1,12,62,75,1.1866666666666668,0.049112238922818546,535,I'll teach him to tailgate...watch me slow down to the speed limit.
2871,1,12,62,75,1.1866666666666668,0.049112238922818546,535,I don't care--being an endangered species doesn't give him the right to be tailgating us.
2871,3,8,64,75,1.1866666666666668,0.055970820368587894,535,It's your turn to walk her.
2871,3,8,64,75,1.1866666666666668,0.055970820368587894,535,That is ridiculous. I did not adopt a rescue whale to keep your mother from backseat driving.
2871,2,10,63,75,1.1866666666666668,0.05265332251978381,535,Thanks for calling shotgun first.
2871,2,10,63,75,1.1866666666666668,0.05265332251978381,535,"I know you said hatchback, but you've got to admit it's impressive."
2871,2,10,63,75,1.1866666666666668,0.05265332251978381,535,I think if we move the gazebo we can make it work.

2871,1,12,62,75,1.1866666666666668,0.049112238922818546,535,I couldn't resist. I heard that baleen is the new quinoa.
2871,4,6,65,75,1.1866666666666668,0.059102394986100974,535,Perhaps a sushi platter for the tailgate party is not such a great idea.
2871,2,10,63,75,1.1866666666666668,0.05265332251978381,535,Slow down. You've already been fined once for being over the legal limit today.

3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,"We sure had a whale of a time, didn't we?"
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,I've never liked a backseat diver.
3663,3,4,62,69,1.144927536231884,0.055688216518499936,535,"Baleen, why won't you be true?"
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,I guess I should have giving in on getting a dog.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"Obviously, it's a mammal."
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,I've heard about it raining cats and dogs but never this!
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Back seat drivers can be really annoying.
3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,I still think think a Shih Tzu would be better for our lifestyle
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Are you having a whale of a time? Cause I'm having a whale of a time.
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"Next time, don't go to Ikea for do-it-yourself fish sticks."
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Well-intended or well-intentioned I'm giving him a ride and that's final.

3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,You said your brother Jonah has been missing for how long again?
3663,4,2,63,69,1.144927536231884,0.05939221260836197,535,Im just surprised that Costco started selling sushi.
3663,3,4,62,69,1.144927536231884,0.055688216518499936,535,I think that really was Roy Scheider we ran over back there.
3663,3,4,62,69,1.144927536231884,0.055688216518499936,535,You know that aquarium promotion might wind up costing us...
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,What? You're not impressed I could fit a whale inside a Beetle?
3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,And they said it fits four.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,I still say 'Surf 'n' Turf' was your idea.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Told you karma's a breach.
3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,All right. Have it your way -- you heard a humpback whale singing.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"Oh, who's a good boy?"

3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,He is from an Uber Pool
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,So this is why a hatch back makes sense. We can load virtually anything back there.
3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,"We'd better buckle him in, too. No need to risk a ticket."
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,Do we really have to get take-out krill again?
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,The reservation said mid-sized.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"Now we can do all the whale-watching we like, without getting seasick!"
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"Your usual ""elephant in the room"" was unavailable, so the agency sent me instead."
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,We must be headed in the right direction. I hear the ocean calling.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,This is what comes of fishing for compliments.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Maybe we should cut back on the seafood drive-through.
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"Of course we'll get it, the poster said no questions asked."

3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,I can't see out the back and adjusting the mirror is _not_ going to help!
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,It’s Uber.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,I put him right in my dating profile. It's not my fault that you thought I was just trying to be funny.
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"Yes you're allowed to split the fare, but you can't pay half in plankton!"
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,And he complains about the crap I bring home.

3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,I think it's time we get a Mini-Van...
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"I was going to rent a Stingray, but this was the only car they had left."
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Isn’t this a bit much for the coy pond?
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"I'm confused... I thought you'd said ""you take the whale."""

3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,It was a whale of a deal !!

3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,I know it's not white but it can still consume my life.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Why can't we talk about the elephant in the room?
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"Never hurts to carry your own Jaws of Life, just in case."
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"So the wife is gonna say, ""ya catch anything today?"""

3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"No, I'm not gonna stop. He may not be a killer whale, but who's to say he isn't some other kind of felony whale?"
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"I need to pee. Can you quickly run in and see if they have a 400-lb. bag filled with fish, crabs and plankton?"
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,Sounds like a whale's tale to me.
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"OK, you were right. ""Krill"" is not a good brand name for a small car."
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,"Well, at least he's not whale-gating."
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"For the last time, I'm not gonna pull over until he puts his siren on."

3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,Maybe we shouldn't have tried to run away from the elephant in the room.
3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,OK. You don't want my mother to come.

3663,2,6,61,69,1.144927536231884,0.05171962876419153,535,I can't help feeling that our surf and turf dinner is still with us.
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,"I agree, we don't seem to be on the same page anymore"
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,It's either this or we wait until he evolves to walk on land again.
3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,Again Jonah?

3663,3,4,62,69,1.144927536231884,0.055688216518499936,535,I said a whale is tailgating us. And no. I don't know if it's an endangered species.
3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,Do you really expect me to believe another one of your fish stories?
3663,1,8,60,69,1.144927536231884,0.04742006474057418,535,Well it's not like we could just leave him there. Have you even seen Blackfish?
3663,0,10,59,69,1.144927536231884,0.04268963668731212,535,"No, I don't recall you mentioning your great uncle Ahab before. Why?"

4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"next time we dine at an all you can eat buffet,don't ask for a doggy bag"
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I think we had to make the left before the aquarium.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Well, since you got blubber instead of flubber, at least put a red flag on the tail!"
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,We should have bought a Hummer.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"I don't get what this ""problem"" is you're talking about."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,It's hard to believe this Hybrid is really reducing our carbon footprint.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,"I think it said you can run your car on blubber, not the whole whale."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I thought you liked to whale on my driving!
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I told you we should have gotten the full-sized SUV!!!
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,It was on sale at SeaWorld.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I had in mind a smaller memento from our summer vacation.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I should've listened to you about not fording that stream.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I suppose you don't dig fins on a mini.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Maybe if we bought a large freezer...
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Let's stop off and get some krill.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,Backseat diver.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"My fortune cookie said, ""You will have a whale of a trip."""
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Were you playing ""Hitch Hiker's Guide"" again?"
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,It's my alternative to talk radio...
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I can't believe this legroom!
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,Will it fit in the refrigerator?
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,"You know we've got a whale on our tail, don't you...and really, you're NOT allowed to say that's a whale of a tale!"
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Not a fish; Is So; Is Not; Is So; Is............
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Right, I have told the company that this new carpool feature was somewhat misleading."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,If you get all up in his krill he becomes a bit of a backseat diver.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Officially, an Uber trainee."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Once again she makes us take her beach party leftovers.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,You're right. I've got to do something. I'll buy a convertible next week.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,It's a backwards take on the the book of Jonah.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I'm thinking steak for dinner...
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,How was I supposed to know he'd be scared of the the fishing boats!
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,Perhaps a humpback whale was the wrong choice.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Stop blubbering. We'll have a whale of a time
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"When I offered to be the designated driver, this isn't what I had in mind."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,It's sad that someone hit it--let's hope it was a stray.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,"Don't test me, Moby. One more word out of you and I will turn this car around and go right back to Sea World."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Not getting the sedan might be the stupidest thing I've ever done.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,Looks fishy to me.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Smells fishy to me!
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,We should stop picking up hitchhikers...
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I wonder how long sashimi stays fresh!
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,We have a whale of a problem and its not going away on its own.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,Not everyone loves Marineland.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,What? I told you I'm an ÜberCetacean driver.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Now let me show you how to operate the front wipers.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Boy, that was one whale of a fender bender."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I think we're beached.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,The mileage isn't great but it rates off the charts on its rear end collision safety scores
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Look at that punim. I couldn't push him back in.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,You clearly said it was the right whale!
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,This isn't the type of Carpooling I had in mind.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Well our son Jonah said he wanted a pet.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"I heard ""a whale OF a prize""!"
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Well, we had a real whale of a time!"
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,How was I supposed to know you didn't want fish for dinner>
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I really like the new car smell of the Barricuda.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,You could at least admit that at 29 I'm over Ahab's dilemma.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,This happens when you don't talk about the elephant.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,When I heard there was going to be a garage sale at Sea World I knew we had to get there early.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Fish AGAIN tonight. I wanted to get Chinese takeout.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Don't you think this is a bit much, just to prove the caviar was locally sourced?"
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,If you think I was tailgating - check this guy out.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,It isn't easy being locovores.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Then perhaps you should douche more often.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,We've got a whale on our tail
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Next time let's buy the full size SUV
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I don't care how much funding you got. 'Uber-for-the-sea' is still a terrible idea.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Shall we stop by the Jones's on our way home?
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Honey, what time does the krill store close?"
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,You said we'd experience marine encounters. I wasn't anticipating this!
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"I do not like your idea of a shopping for natural, organic food for dinner at the source."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I think we're gonna need a bigger car.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"It's the major reason I bought the car. If you wanna save the whales, you need a giant trunk."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"But honey, you said we could get a new pet."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Hey, you were the one who wanted fish tonight."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Wake up honey.........I think i'm in your dream!
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Now that we've managed to discuss the elephant in the room...
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Anybody in the mood for seafood?
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Sorry for the delay honey, I came straight back from the wharf."
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,What we need is a humpback car
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I know I know. We need to go south.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,It's going to cost a fortune to stuff that thing.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,maybe we should have left it in the water.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,I don't think this is a car wash
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"In the future, please don't pack for both of us."
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,Damn whalegater.
4533,3,1,60,64,1.109375,0.05508465481809405,535,I sick and tired of you feeling like a third whale.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Sing along if you wish, dear. I'll split the plankton."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Honey, I promise I keep him in our pool for just a few weeks."
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,I am exhausted! What a vacation and to think I have to wait another year to have this much fun again. Life is wonderful.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Darn, another whale-gater!"
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Since neither one of us is willing to broach the elephant in the room, I thought this might work."
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,"Well, I had a whale of a time."
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,The 'sharing economy' is becoming a fishy business.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,Why can't I say it was a joint effort? After all I did buy the bait.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Herman missed the school bus.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,"So, we can get a freezer!"
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,I told you not to call me Ishmael.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,But I have always wanted a white elephant.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Sorry, I mentioned fish in my dating profile."
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,I've had it with your back seat driving.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,Are you sure your aquarium is big enough?
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,Move over Ahabass!
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,"Hey, at least we don't have to fool with a car seat."
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,How could it smell fishy?
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I'm thinkin' of baleen out of this krilling traffic.
4533,2,3,59,64,1.109375,0.050381419694137494,535,Don't look now but I think we are being followed.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,I think he escaped from Sea World.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,Brian found out the hard way that Ambien and fish tacos should not be taken in the same evening.
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,This isn't what I meant by having a whale of a time at the shore.
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,You had to bring a third wheel!
4533,0,7,57,64,1.109375,0.039322054350368486,535,I told you I didn't want to go to the beach!
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"But, honey, you said I keep whatever I caught!"
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"I know it's a bit extreme, but what's the other option? Stale caviar?"
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,First time in a Mercedes-Baleen?
4533,3,1,60,64,1.109375,0.05508465481809405,535,There ought to be a law against whalegating.
4533,3,1,60,64,1.109375,0.05508465481809405,535,I thought it said SALE!
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,When are we going to talk about the elephant in the room that's under the whale?
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,i heard it was a wishing whale
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,"Yea, Roger, that's how the term ""fish tail"" originated."
4533,1,5,58,64,1.109375,0.045191323330536354,535,So exactly how far behind are we on our premiums to the Neptune Society?
