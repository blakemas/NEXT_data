777,10,20,123,153,1.261437908496732,0.046155278732855486,532,"Next time, it'll be the loan shark. And he uses his teeth."
777,9,22,122,153,1.261437908496732,0.04521405138783825,532,You'll receive an email from the resort staff asking you to evaluate me. Can I count on you to give me a 5?
777,9,22,122,153,1.261437908496732,0.04521405138783825,532,"Did you miss me too, Jonah?"
777,9,22,122,153,1.261437908496732,0.04521405138783825,532,"It's funny, my ex also said I was a crushing disappointment"
777,9,22,122,153,1.261437908496732,0.04521405138783825,532,The real estate agent advertised this island as deserted.
777,9,22,122,153,1.261437908496732,0.04521405138783825,532,"On second thought, you get on my back."

777,8,24,121,153,1.261437908496732,0.044252809299484865,532,I guess it wasn't a mirage
777,7,26,120,153,1.261437908496732,0.04327021861385808,532,Look- it's a ship! You're saved!
777,5,30,118,153,1.261437908496732,0.04123485412706176,532,Beach access is members-only.
777,6,28,119,153,1.261437908496732,0.04226479039206945,532,"So if you were stranded on a desert island with just one mammal, which one would you choose?"

777,6,28,119,153,1.261437908496732,0.04226479039206945,532,You're mumbling again.
777,9,22,122,153,1.261437908496732,0.04521405138783825,532,You looked like you could use a hug.
777,8,24,121,153,1.261437908496732,0.044252809299484865,532,"Sorry, I was on cruise control."

815,8,23,121,152,1.256578947368421,0.04427557808511744,532,So this is crushing loneliness.
815,6,27,119,152,1.256578947368421,0.042261685523532766,532,I know -- yuuge! A lot of people tell me that.
815,4,31,117,152,1.256578947368421,0.04014689666473146,532,"You can run but you can't hide, Ishmael."
815,9,21,122,152,1.256578947368421,0.04524892474426334,532,Who says no whale is an island?
