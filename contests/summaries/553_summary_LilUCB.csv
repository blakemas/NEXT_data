225,15,30,83,128,1.46875,0.0616951125248088,553,So maybe we should scrap the Electoral College.
225,17,26,85,128,1.46875,0.06365807019989533,553,Still think we shouldn't take him literally?
225,17,26,85,128,1.46875,0.06365807019989533,553,So... what are your plans for his second day in office?
225,13,34,81,128,1.46875,0.05966761196262873,553,...and what do you think we can expect for the SECOND week of the new administration?
225,16,28,84,128,1.46875,0.06268427558416713,553,And to think it's only been ten days since the inauguration.
225,14,32,82,128,1.46875,0.06068982957123728,553,"Ok, maybe we do need counseling."
225,16,28,84,128,1.46875,0.06268427558416713,553,"To be fair, he's only been in office for a month."
225,16,28,84,128,1.46875,0.06268427558416713,553,And yet they still won't abolish the Electoral College.
225,15,30,83,128,1.46875,0.0616951125248088,553,I told you we shouldn't have gotten Samsung phones!
225,14,32,82,128,1.46875,0.06068982957123728,553,You looked less surrounded by devastation in your profile.
225,20,20,88,128,1.46875,0.06649394250428967,553,I heard that President Trump thought the red button was for room service!

240,16,27,84,127,1.4645669291338583,0.06303897770213426,553,Trump just tweeted that their first strike was 'overrated'.

240,13,33,81,127,1.4645669291338583,0.059991329197406,553,I'm starting to think 2016 wasn't that bad...
240,18,23,86,127,1.4645669291338583,0.06499139530457815,553,We shouldn't have joked about his penis.
240,12,35,80,127,1.4645669291338583,0.05894043774793886,553,Did you have any trouble finding the place?

262,18,21,85,124,1.4596774193548387,0.0661789069468289,553,This calls for a selfie

262,12,33,79,124,1.4596774193548387,0.05994051770970984,553,Ha! They all laughed when we scrunched down under our desks.
262,13,31,80,124,1.4596774193548387,0.061024552492169405,553,Well that escalated quickly.
262,16,25,83,124,1.4596774193548387,0.06416686869057925,553,"I said yes, 'yes the gas is not off'."
262,9,39,76,124,1.4596774193548387,0.05656389866888189,553,The good news is they've found our luggage.

1082,8,17,71,96,1.34375,0.06425709906852126,553,I told you not to run the vacuum and the washer at the same time.

1082,7,19,70,96,1.34375,0.06252740627187185,553,I think he actually thought it was a real football.
1082,9,15,72,96,1.34375,0.0659414363379794,553,And you thought his inauguration would be boring
1082,8,17,71,96,1.34375,0.06425709906852126,553,Now we know what that button was for.

1800,6,13,67,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06377602538914648,553,Their calling it the 'tweet heard round the world'
1800,7,11,68,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06588610798684778,553,And if I WAS the last man on earth?

1800,8,9,69,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06793067817173679,553,Well at least he didn't have a private email server.
1800,6,13,67,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06377602538914648,553,I guess Kim Jung-un called The Donald's bluff.

1800,2,21,63,86,1.2906976744186047,0.05452513337505023,553,At least he did something in the first hundred days.
1800,9,7,70,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06991548360763578,553,"If this is the end of civilization as we know it, at least that means he won't be re-elected."

1800,2,21,63,86,1.2906976744186047,0.05452513337505023,553,Was that necessary - just to keep my mother from visiting?!
1800,5,15,66,86,1.2906976744186047,0.061593697755692074,553,"Well, you're the one who voted for him."
1800,7,11,68,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06588610798684778,553,I wonder what would've happened if Russia hadn't been our friend...
1800,4,17,65,86,1.2906976744186047,0.05933115363788266,553,I imagined ‘airy with historic views’ differently
1800,9,7,70,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06991548360763578,553,"Well you're nothing like your profile pic, Mr ""lastmanonearth69"" but I guess you'll have to do."

2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Not if you were the last man on earth.
2053,6,11,66,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06485421389744174,553,"I'm not moving until you say, ""I'm sorry."""

2053,7,9,67,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06708149834734967,553,Hey! I'm not the one who voted for him!
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,How was I supposed to know a politician was going to do exactly what he said he was going to do?
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,"Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have given a damn about Hillary's email."
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,I still don't want to meet your mother.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,Honestly....Netflix is what I miss the most.
2053,6,11,66,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06485421389744174,553,"Ok dear, maybe I should try the Acidophilus."
2053,7,9,67,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06708149834734967,553,I bet you feel some guilt NOW over pushing so hard for the vasectomy.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,A penny for your thoughts.
2053,1,21,61,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05231421660412566,553,You knew I had a temper when you married me.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,But you voted to change the landscape!
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,And I thought the election results were a disaster
2053,2,19,62,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05505120906187008,553,I tell you I don't care. What do YOU want to do for dinner?
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Still glad you voted for him?
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,"Oh c'mon, we've got front row seats."
2053,8,7,68,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06923717051408027,553,I TOLD you not to use foil in the microwave!
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,This is why you don't stick a knife in the toaster.
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,I still think it's Hillary's fault.
2053,7,9,67,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06708149834734967,553,Pizza or Chinese?
2053,6,11,66,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06485421389744174,553,You just had to send that tweet about Trump's haircut!
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Don't look at me like that. I didn't vote for him.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,"Okay, maybe that slogan should have been ""Make America Again""."
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,"See, not everything is fake news!"
2053,3,17,63,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05765842505171362,553,Let's eat out instead.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,Had we added an 'acts of war' rider we'd be sitting pretty.
2053,2,19,62,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05505120906187008,553,I dunno. What do you want to do?
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,Survivors can't be choosers!
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Let's not start over.
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Surely they knew #DrainTheSwamp was a metaphor.
2053,2,19,62,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05505120906187008,553,"Madam, I'm Adam"
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,"Yes, but I didn't think he'd really do it."
2053,3,17,63,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05765842505171362,553,Well. OK. But let's look at the positive side.
2053,3,17,63,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05765842505171362,553,Okay: I was wrong to tell you not to worry about the oven.

2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,They're saying to cut the new Administration some slack.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,"Oh, so it's my fault?"
2053,8,7,68,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06923717051408027,553,Maybe buying the pressure cooker wasn't such a good idea.
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Look at the bright side. Now we don't need to make room for your mother.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,And you still think it was okay to vote for that man..?!

2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,"While it WAS a load-bearing wall, I think we can both agree this really opens up the space."
2053,3,17,63,83,1.2771084337349397,0.05765842505171362,553,I guess this means we can skip couples therapy.
2053,4,15,64,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06015274174727554,553,"Oh well, we've survived worse."

2053,7,9,67,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06708149834734967,553,Maybe I was wrong about the world not coming to an end if we skipped dinner with your sister.
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,I see no earthly reason to wait any longer for the cable guy. Gladys.
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Honest. All I did was ‘like’ Alec Baldwin’s impersonation of Trump.

2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,Alright. Perhaps it was a bit of an overreaction.
2053,5,13,65,83,1.2771084337349397,0.06254766742241294,553,"Fine, I admit it: casting a protest vote was a mistake."

2352,7,7,66,80,1.2625,0.06830624913495159,553,I told you I had a gluten allergy.
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"But you did say, 'Whatever it takes to get rid of the rats'—and now you've changed your mind?!"

2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,Yeah but her emails.
2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,"Well, hindsight is always 2020, but I still think 'Make America Great Again' was an appealing concept."

2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,"This is not what I thought he meant by ""great"""
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,"Well, do you know any restaurants on the west side?"
2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,This neighborhood will only get better.
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,Do you think the buses have stopped running?
2352,8,5,67,80,1.2625,0.07058469640856017,553,I'd vote for him again.
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,I think the Russians hacked TripAdvisor
2352,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,553,Good thing you canned all that salsa.
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,I thought retirement would have more to offer.
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,Not smitten. Smote.
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,Where do you want to scavenge for dinner?
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,And that's why there was an electoral college
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,We should have agreed to negotiate.
2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,Don't look at me ; I didn't vote for him.
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,I suggest we stop here and save the rest for our therapy.
2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,"Speed dating rules, okay?"
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,"I never imagined that ""Make America Great Again"" required a complete makeover."
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,"No, I never got around to watching the final episode. So you wouldn't be spoiling it."
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,I'll see what the deductible is on our policy.
2352,7,7,66,80,1.2625,0.06830624913495159,553,"Well, thank God for those emails! Just imagine the fix we'd be in if Hillary had won."
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,He did say he'd shake things up.
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,At least he's using the right e-mail server.
2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,Now aren't you glad that we didn't buy that expensive rug.
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,Does it also mean that tragedy equals comedy minus time?
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"So, how has YOUR January 21st been?"
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,"You're right, it's not that great."
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,See? I told you voting for him wouldn't matter. We're just fine.
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,I still don't regret my vote.
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,Did you hear that ?
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"Yes, I still don’t like her; and no, I would not change my vote now."
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"Give him a chance, would you? He's only been in office for a week."
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"It has to get bad, before it gets 'great again'!"
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,Don't blame me. I voted for Her
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"You are using the word ""literally"" wrong."
2352,7,7,66,80,1.2625,0.06830624913495159,553,I'm starting to think the liberal elites were right about Trump.
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,At least he drained the swamp...
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,I guess now there is no longer a need for The Wall.
2352,1,19,60,80,1.2625,0.05260237155937825,553,Unfriending them just wasn't enough.
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,"It's not the end of the world, Eve."
2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,Adventure and frugal were the only guidelines you gave me on picking our vacation Muriel.
2352,3,15,62,80,1.2625,0.0583088405482046,553,Isn't our second date a little early to start talking about repopulating?
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,Hillary should have campaigned in Wisconsin
2352,1,19,60,80,1.2625,0.05260237155937825,553,"So, do you think the bus will be on time?"
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,How is this is my fault?
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,"Ok, I'll grant you the weather does seem to be changing."
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,What's a nice girl like you doing in a post-apocalyptic world like this?
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"Well, at least the neighbor's dog won't wake you up in the morning."
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,"Well, I guess it is a little ironic that I was stockpiling gasoline, explosives and kitchen matches in anticipation of an apocalypse."
2352,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,553,They claim his finger slipped when he gave someone the bird.
2352,5,11,64,80,1.2625,0.06350458470442125,553,I understand real estate is very cheap here in Aleppo.
2352,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,553,Now will you stop smoking!
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,Okay. Now getting back to Hillary's e-mails.
2352,6,9,65,80,1.2625,0.06594913172046729,553,"""Well, I guess that's that""."
2352,4,13,63,80,1.2625,0.06096209135420536,553,"Okay, I admit it: I shouldn't have kept saying, 'That's only what he says, not what he means.'"
2352,2,17,61,80,1.2625,0.05552895811982625,553,I've always wanted to start from scratch.
2446,6,9,66,81,1.2592592592592593,0.06521043282095929,553,"Don't worry dear, Trump will eventually get the hang of it."
2446,5,11,65,81,1.2592592592592593,0.06279935169560431,553,Is it really the end of the world if I don't visit your mother?
2448,4,13,65,82,1.2560975609756098,0.059635992099364196,553,"Yes, I promise I'll never try to make dinner for us again, Dear....."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,But the important thing is we haven't compromised our principles.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"What was it you were saying about ""last man on earth?"""
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Okay, yes, you had a point. But were we supposed to just ignore those emails?"
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Now, what did you want to talk about before we were so rudely interrupted?"
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,I *know* you're the last woman on Earth. It's a figure of speech!
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"My day was fine, how was yours?"
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I told you we should have taken the nuclear holocaust rider.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Don't make this into a bigger thing.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"Turns out, we paid for it."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I told you a vacation in Syria is a bad idea.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Great again?
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,"Yeah, but at least he got rid of Obamacare!"
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Well, if I had to guess, I'd say Eve."
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,And that'why I think Bernie would have won
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Well, I DO consider this a date."
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Maybe we should eat out tonight?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,At least I heard the wall on the southern border is still intact.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"If it didn't spark joy, I got rid of it."
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I thought Vladimir and The Donald were friends!
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,"Well, at least this solves our illegal immigration problem."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I'd like to have a nuclear family some day.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,What were we fighting about?
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,You still want that divorce?
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"Yeah, but Hillary's emails."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"CheapMideastVacations.com? Good job, honey!"
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,January 21st isn't as bad as I thought it would be
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I don't suppose we can get takeout.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,The first 100 days
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,Time to enjoy our empty nest!
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"Well, I never promised you a rose garden."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Face it, Doris--our son needs help."
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,You told me to use the plunger.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,It's funny how focused our conversations can be when you wipe away all the distractions.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Well, at least we have our health."
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"I knew this was coming, but I thought he'd at least get sworn into office first!"
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"Next time you tap your ruby slippers please don't say, ""There's no place like Homs."""
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Okay, okay, okay. Maybe, just maybe, Hillary would have been better."
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,Really not sure where Amazon will be leaving our deliveries.
2449,7,6,66,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06852731571533752,553,"Don't look at me like that, I voted for Hillary!"
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,Maybe now you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior...
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Did you really mean it when you said you wouldn't sleep with me even if I was the only man left on Earth?
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"I don't think this is the ""fresh start"" the marriage counsellor envisioned for us."
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I told you to read the directions.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I want a divorce.
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,I think the election turned out fine.
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,Still better than Hillary.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"Honey, I think I forgot to turn the gas off."
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,"I promise, once our luggage arrives you'll feel much better."
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"My, those were good beans!"
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Now will you marry me?
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,Who'd of thought a Tweet could do all this?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"What do we do now, Eve?"
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,I forgot my safe word.
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,It appears that gerrymandering has side effects.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"Well, we knew Trump was going to change things"
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,Told you Bernie was the answer.
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,We won. Still not happy?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,All right we're done with the community property.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Makin' America great again requires starting from zero.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,The good news is the furniture arrives tomorrow.
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,"I slept with her once, four years ago. Why are we still talking about this?"
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I think we should go with House Number Two.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Look on the bright side. Hell didn't freeze over.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Shall we eat out tonight?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I told you that vote for Jill Stein was a waste...
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,I'm just saying it's a pretty big coincidence that this happened right when you asked me to do the dishes.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I assume this answers your question.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,Yes. I put a fork in the toaster.
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,I suppose this means the bus will be late again.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Why can't you ever look at the bright side?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Are you still mad at me?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Hi Eve. I'm Adam.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Do you think the bus will be on time today?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Well, I'm the last man on earth. How about that date?"
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Any plans next Tuesday?
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,And to think he did all of this in his first month.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,This is probably an exception to needing a formal introduction first.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Yeah, but think how bad it would've been if she'd won."
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I called Geico but the phone was dead.

2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,I pick the next vacation destination.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"Yes, but she did have her own email server"

2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Did I mention that I'm thinking of becoming a vegan?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I'll miss Mexico too. But it was cheaper than building the wall.
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,How do you feel about procreation?
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Now what? I leveled the playing field......
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Well this time Mexico can pay for it.
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,I told you it was off season!

2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"No, I asked you to turn off the stove."
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Can we at least agree he was right about Putin's strength?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Care to join me in starting-up the human population again?
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,At least you don't have to deal with my clutter anymore.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I think the next election should be decided by the popular vote
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Minor side effects are to be expected when making America great again.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,But what were you cooking?
2449,7,6,66,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06852731571533752,553,I thought he said he was going to make America great again.
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,So what do you think of Trump now?
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,That thing you said about 'Not even if you were the last man on Earth.' Did you mean it?
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"Finally, America is great again."
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,"No, you're the one who said, 'Vote for Trump. What could go wrong?'"
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I'm still peeved about those emails.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,So now I suppose we can put your Degree in Dystopian Literature to good use?
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,But Hillary had a private email server!
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,It could have been worse
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,I love what you've done with the space.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I blame fake news.
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,"At least now, Trump will not be reelected."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"So, are we thinking pizza tonight?"
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,You can't beat the taxes.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,You should have been here yesterday
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I thought you turned off the coffeemaker.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Just think of all the celebrity deaths.

2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I think our side won.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"If we give President Trump another four years, I'm sure he'll turn things around."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Looked like a little innocent drone to me.
2449,1,18,60,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05242683788109758,553,I told you it would blow over.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,Don't worry - fake-news
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"For the hundredth time, I'm sorry I forgot our anniversary."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I doubt we'll see a taxi for a while.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,I don't understand. The bus is usually right on time.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"I can't think of anything funny, either."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"OK, fine. He didn't make it great again."
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,You always said not even if you were last man in the world. Care to reconsider?
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,What makes you so sure it was Russia?
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,"Ok, NOW your mother can't stay with us."

2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"Honey, this is all they have in our price range."
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Al Roker was sure off base with this one
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,Don't ever light up a cigarette after judging a Chili cook off.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,I still think Hillary shouldn't have had a private email server.
2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,I'm glad we spent all that time on choosing drapes.

2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Well, at least we didn't vote for the candidate with the private email server"
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Is this a bad time to tell you I cancelled our homeowner's insurance to pay the health insurance deductible.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"Honey, I don't think this has anything to do with my leaving the toilet seat up."

2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,That was one hell of a Tweetstorm
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,This isn’t the post-election outcome I voted for!!
2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,"Well, I hope the 2020 Inauguration event is better than this one."

2449,2,16,61,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05543593847887846,553,... but you can call me Adam.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have voted for Jill Stein."

2449,6,8,65,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06611673807990255,553,I see you're not wearing your 'Make America Great Again' hat
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"Ok, we gave him a chance. Now what?"
2449,1,18,60,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05242683788109758,553,"So, I voted for him, so, sue me."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I wonder what's holding up the bus this time.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"Next year, I'm voting for the Democrat."

2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Let's just put it out on the table that neither of us would be our first choice to repopulate the planet and go from there.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,I think that this vacation was a total disaster.
2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,"Ok, Ok. You were right that it was dangerous to let him near the button."
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Really. It's up to us to repopulate.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,"Sure, but SHE had her own email server"

2449,3,14,62,79,1.2531645569620253,0.05828990667222849,553,Why do we always have to bring other people into our fights?
2449,7,6,66,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06852731571533752,553,I was just trying to surprise you with dinner . . . and then Whoosh!
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,I liked him. He said what was on his mind.
2449,5,10,64,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06361488119538797,553,"Yes, but emails."

2449,7,6,66,79,1.2531645569620253,0.06852731571533752,553,He's running for a second term.
2449,4,12,63,79,1.2531645569620253,0.0610105168366915,553,Next time let's follow the instructions!

3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,I guess he really didn't care if North Korea got nuclear weapons.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,Obviously I'm going to read the Airbnb reviews before booking next time.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Okay, now that you've made your point...."

3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,It's nice to see the EPA and HUD starting to work together.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,I think there's a bit more to it than me falling asleep with my pipe lit.

3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,It was a huge success.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,Insurance. How about you?
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"ok fine, your right, there's probably a better way to start the pilot light on the stove"
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,What about now that I _am_ the last man on Earth?
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,You should have said something when you saw something.
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,"I know, I know but come on! Did you see her emails?"
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,We'll rebuild. Guatemala will pay.
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,"If not apocalypse NOW, when then, Janet, when?"
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,A little fixer-upper to begin with.
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,"So, where are you from?"
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,How is it that these vacations only seem to qualify as disasters when I select the destination?
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,"Well, he said he knew more than the CIA and the generals."
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,"so... I guess this is what they meant by ""great again"""
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,At least it will be a memorable first date.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Yes, as a matter of fact, I would still have voted for Trump."
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,See... didn't I tell you that life would still go on.
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,Here's to Donald Trump 2017!
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,North Korea looked so nice in the propaganda.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"So, have you started dinner yet?"
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Oh yeah, this is still Hillary's fault for not getting elected"
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"Take what the president-elect says symbolically, not literally."
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,I was pleasantly surprised to meet a kindred spirit on Match: someone who also found post-apocalyptic settings to be romantic.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,Do you believe in love at first sight?
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"Well, that was a heck of an election."
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,Does HGTV have post nuclear fixer-upper?
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,this... this is the worst that could've happened.
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,There goes our health care.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"So, what else is new?"
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,I know a determined developer when I see one.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,Not to fear. This is just what Detroit needed.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"See, I told you... I'm a woman scorned."
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,I believed him when he said he was going to end terrorism; I just thought there would be a few more left on earth.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,This reminds me of a story...
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Yes, but he DID build that wall."
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Fine, the photos do do it justice."
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,Now are you sorry you voted for him?
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,The review said 'elegant austerity.' You try finding a better place to stay in Aleppo.
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,Then Trump got on his twitter account to respond to the accusation.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,I told you he would press the button.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,We'll always have Glasnost.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"No. I STILL won't go out with you, even if you ARE the last man on earth!"
3093,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,553,It's a chance for us to get to know each other again...
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,So what was your position in the Trump administration?
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,You shouldn't have made those incendiary remarks
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,I told you not to touch the remote.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"Face it, Helen. We're just no good for each other."
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Hon, sorry. We're between a rock and a hard place."
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,But at least he tells it like it is.
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,I wouldn't go out with you again if you were the last man on earth.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Why are you looking at me like that, you voted for him."
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,Thanks for meeting with me...
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Now, where were we?"
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,I have a nagging feeling I left the stove on.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"Well, it was, ""huuuge."""
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,I'm tired of winning.
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,So much for a president who tells it like it is.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Well, who did YOU vote for?"
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,But have you seen his ratings?
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,Honey I unclogged the sink.
3093,0,17,58,75,1.2266666666666666,0.04866999865182624,553,"At least we showed those cockroaches, didn't we?"
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,"On the bright side, these are preferable to that hideous sectional."
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,At this point I'd say that the lack of room service is a moot point.
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,This is the worst shore excursion ever.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,That's the last time I buy a toaster oven on clearance.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,I'd ask you out - but we already are.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,I still say I'm not going to your mother's.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't have voted for him."
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,Did you pay the President Liability Policy Premium?
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,So big business is running the goverment. It's not the end of the world.
3093,6,5,64,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06731219006191175,553,"Well, Mr. Goosestep, you got exactly what you wanted- a male president who knows how to shake things up."
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,"Yeah, well Trump said they started it."
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,I keep telling you -- I DIDN'T vote for him!
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,I guess you have to say YES now!
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"No, still not interested."
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,I always knew getting that vasectomy was a bad idea.
3093,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,553,You said you wanted unobstructed views
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,Something must have delayed Godot.
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"All righty, then. Let's revisit Plan B."
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,Our first date was a blast.
3093,4,9,62,75,1.2266666666666666,0.06172690021546691,553,Don't look at me like that. I voted for Obama.
3093,5,7,63,75,1.2266666666666666,0.0645799548665882,553,I misinterpreted the AIRBnB review.
3093,1,15,59,75,1.2266666666666666,0.052241067457787733,553,The app says all busses are running on schedule
3093,2,13,60,75,1.2266666666666666,0.055583176317024995,553,Will you date me now?
3093,3,11,61,75,1.2266666666666666,0.05873542244548726,553,"Wow, that was close. Now where do we go for lunch?"
3271,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,553,Don't say no to a fresh start.
3271,5,7,64,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06379430819500599,553,"Ok, fine. You were right. A Trump presidency was one of the signs of the Apocalypse."
3271,1,15,60,76,1.2236842105263157,0.0516353075535489,553,"Sure, there have been a few bumps in the road, but you don't see any immigrants around, do you?"
3271,3,11,62,76,1.2236842105263157,0.058034122480782775,553,Look on the bright side. It'll only take four or eight years to rebuild.
3271,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,553,Let's give it a chance with an open mind...
3271,3,11,62,76,1.2236842105263157,0.058034122480782775,553,"There was this video, 'Re-light your gas heater's pilot."" That's all I remember."
3271,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,553,"For the last time, no, I didn't vote for him either!"
3271,2,13,61,76,1.2236842105263157,0.05492797264720445,553,I wasn't kidding when I said if You were the last guy on earth.
3271,3,11,62,76,1.2236842105263157,0.058034122480782775,553,So what made you swipe right?
3271,0,17,59,76,1.2236842105263157,0.048117853164570096,553,You just couldn't ask for directions.
3271,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,553,And to think that an angry tweet led to all this.
3271,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,553,This is why you can't go home again.
3271,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,553,Thanks Obama!
3271,3,11,62,76,1.2236842105263157,0.058034122480782775,553,How was I to know five-year-olds could be so hard to control?
3271,4,9,63,76,1.2236842105263157,0.06098226434871825,553,"Really, I'm surprised it took this long"
3271,3,11,62,76,1.2236842105263157,0.058034122480782775,553,"Ok, so the inauguration was more than I expected...."
3287,5,6,63,74,1.2162162162162162,0.0645958880743686,553,It was the meeting to end all meetings.
3287,4,8,62,74,1.2162162162162162,0.06166356711357833,553,"Emily, I want a divorce."
3287,4,8,62,74,1.2162162162162162,0.06166356711357833,553,where do you think you parked the car?
3287,2,12,60,74,1.2162162162162162,0.05533469992039017,553,"Did I say ""the LAST woman on earth?"""
3287,4,8,62,74,1.2162162162162162,0.06166356711357833,553,"You're the one who voted for him, I didn't."
3287,2,12,60,74,1.2162162162162162,0.05533469992039017,553,"Have you seen ""La La Land"" yet?"
3287,3,10,61,74,1.2162162162162162,0.05858465893239631,553,And THAT is why you don't feed aardvarks nitroglycerin.
3287,3,10,61,74,1.2162162162162162,0.05858465893239631,553,What's your next idea Honey?

3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,Ceasefires just aren't what they used to be.
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,I guess going with War-Torn Tours wasn't such a good idea.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,I'll bet you're a glass half empty person.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,I would report this but it seems too much like a fake news story.
3461,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,553,...and how many times have I told you to turn off the iron before you leave the house?
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,The 'replace' part may take a little time.
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,"Honest, mother. I didn't do anything."
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,"So, how do you feel about voting for Trump now?!"
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,So were you sent back here to repopulate as well?
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,DIVORCE was the nuclear option!
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,"Yes, now we can talk."

3461,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,553,"Well, we still have each other."
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,So I drive too slow. It's not like there won't be another Rapture.
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"With that being said, Danielle, will you accept this rose?"

3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"Okay, but on the bright side, we can now find out if we DO have what it takes."
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,For better or worse
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,"Well, I'm just glad to have voted for a change candidate that finally delivered."

3461,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,553,"Yes, but I thought we'd still have football and mixed martial arts."
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,I still think she would have been worse.
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,No more candles.
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,Can we just call it fake news?
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,Voting for him seemed a good idea at the time.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,I never thought he might actually win!
3461,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,553,Good thing our flight was late
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,Should I ask for a different table?

3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,He won.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,We'll start with a trendy coffee shop
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,Would you say it's safe to call ours a post-election relationship?
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,Did you remember to bring any snacks?
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,I wonder what the kids are up to.
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"Well, aren't you the most beautiful woman in the whole city."
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,Should we go out for dinner?
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,I told you not to let me eat beans.
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,Okay- so I did vote for him.
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"Now that that's settled, what's for dinner?"
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,"Well, did YOU read the fine print?"
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,How was I supposed to know that would happen?
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,"Well, he certainly has taken Nixon's madman theory to the next level."
3461,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,553,"OK, maybe I left the gas on."

3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,At least we have each other.
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,it's still better than Hillary.
3461,5,5,62,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06541519016903742,553,But you must concede that der Fuehrer very nearly made Deutschland Great Again!

3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,Tell me you did not forget to pay the casualty insurance.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,"OK, now I see my vote was a mistake."
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,I guess your lawyer really did mean scorched earth.
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,It ain't over till it's over...
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,Then the machines took offence to the president-elect's tweets.
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,Not if you were the last person on earth!
3461,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,553,Curse the electoral college system!!
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,It drives me crazy that you don't empty the dishwasher.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,What's for supper?
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,I apparently misunderstood your definition of 'nuclear option'.......
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,And to think it all started with a tweet....
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"Ok, but I'm keeping the furniture."
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"When he asked, ""What do you have to lose?"" I didn't think he meant everything."

3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"I guess it's up to us, Eve."
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,You're the one who voted for him.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,"I don't suppose you kept the receipt for that pressure cooker, did you?"
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,I told you to check the stove before we left!

3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,Monday's; am I right?
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,It looks like we've solved all of the world's problems in one fell swoop.
3461,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,553,You just had to send him that nasty tweet!
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"Hey, don't look at me. I didn't vote for him!"
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,Eve?
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,How about we just stay out tonight?
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,I knew a scorched earth divorce wasn't a solution
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,They were serious about getting rid of all of Obamacare.
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,I still say there was nothing wrong with his foreign policy.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,"Yes, 'nuclear option' _is_ an overused metaphor."

3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"So, you left the stove on?"
3461,2,11,59,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05572645856918899,553,"So... what was all that ""last man on earth"" talk?"
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,At least the spare key didn't get damaged.
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,Should we order a pizza?
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,"Come on, give him another chance! Let's see how he does in his next 100 days."
3461,4,7,61,72,1.2083333333333333,0.06235311378048466,553,We're the only survivors left on earth.... I still want a divorce.
3461,3,9,60,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05913268547421808,553,Checking back now that I AM the last man on earth.
3461,1,13,58,72,1.2083333333333333,0.05209800262902861,553,"Okay, now comes the pivot."

5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"Obviously, our options are severely limited."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I didn't vote for Trump..Did you?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,But you said you were tired of neighbors

5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,``We can now eliminate the city condo. That leaves the duplex in the gated community or the suburban colonial. Any strong preference?''
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"You agreed, ""Low cost, adventure vacation, off the beaten path"" sounded interesting"
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,"So, are you an only child, as of today, or before all of this happened?"
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I guess someone didn't like his hair.
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,I don't care. I'd still vote for Jill Stein.

5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I think it's a complete re-build
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,well; I guess the Russia relationship WAS wrong!
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"So as you can see, we are in a period of rebuilding."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I guess we won't be using that microwave anymore!
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,I guess the blowout we had last week over increasing our 401k savings seems somewhat mild now.

5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"Indeed, Mad Max looked a tad more glamourous"
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"Well, you voted for Trump..."
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,Do you think George R. R. Martin survived?
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"Ok, ok. You were right. But you can bet there will be no Mexicans coming across the border!"
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Who knew dystopia would mean we'd be sitting atop our tombstones?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Frankly my dear I don't give a damn
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I ask because your posture suggests you may be preoccupied by something.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,Looks like its just you and me. Too bad you're a Republican.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I told you Tommy's chemistry set was a bad idea.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Everything you touch turns to smolder.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,Remember when whoopie cushions were all the rage?
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,Aleppo tried to warn us of those damn Russian real-estate agents....
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,It's not quite how I thought it would look .
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Did you get the cigarettes out of the house?
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I told you not to use a scorched earth campaign.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Maybe you and I got off on the wrong foot.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,A brand new plan? Together this time?
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"Also, two or three weeks ago all the garden catalogues started arriving in the mail."
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,You're right. This place is da bomb.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"See, hunny, I told you it was useless organizing that attic..."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,Does this job include room and board?
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I have nothing to complain about.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I'm STILL not going to your mother's birthday party.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"If we are the new Adam and Eve, aren't we a bit on the old side to be able to procreate and repopulate the earth?"
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I'm sure the waiter will arrive any moment.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"I know, I know. It's a bit of a fixer upper, but what do you think?"
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I THINK WE WON!
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"Now that I'm the last man on Earth, perhaps you'd like to reconsider."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"Well, I KNOW it wasn't me!"
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,Where exactly was that red line again?
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,None of this would've happened if you just got over Hillary Clinton's emails!
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I told you we shouldn't visit Iraq for vacation
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,No-one ever told me there'd be days like this.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,I told you it was a fixer-upper.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,Evidently your Samsung blew.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,We should have worked harder at compromise
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,"Yes, Dorothy...I'd say it's a Toto loss."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,Is this good karma or bad karma?
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"HE JUST WANTED SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF HIS COUNTRY TO SAY ""WE LOVE YOUR HAIRCUT""."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,WOW! The party was a blast!
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I heard the new HUD plan will be good for jobs and the economy.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I used to come here before the war.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I'm beginning to think that somebody has an issue with us.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,Okay...okay...you were right! We should have had the calamari in Monterey instead of the sushi in Fukushima.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I like your place.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"Well, at least he's building a wall."
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,"Ok, next time you wash and I'll dry."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,That email server seemed so important during the election.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,So do you want to try the mannequin challenge?
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,What do you want to do for lunch?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"So, about that date...."
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,I voted for Jill Stein.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,He said something about having a bad hair day
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,I told you Trump was trouble.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"Man, you've gotten fat."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Do you think it's too late to kiss and make up?
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,Who do you like for the Supreme Court?
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"'Best of all, it has easy access to downtown'"
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Will you be my Facebook friend now?
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"So, did you finish your bucket list?"
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Oh NOW you want to get dinner...
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,At least we still have eachother
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,Who did you vote for again?
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"So, this looks like a nice spot for a garden."
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,What do you mean the apocalypse isn't a valid excuse for canceling dinner with your parents?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I guess I should have clarified what I meant by 'Fixer Upper' ...
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"I knew he planned to drain it, but this seems like overkill."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"So, who are you going to vote for this year?"
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"I still feel ""he told it like it was""."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"Armageddon? No, never heard of it."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,This area is really blowing up right now.
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,You happy? I'm no longer obsessed with Facebook.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"Yes, the smoke bothers my eyes as well."
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"When you asked where I wanted to go for my birthday I said, "" to see Rio"", not ""to Syria."""
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"That was your ""little"" secret?"
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,'' you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off''
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,Do you think these pants go with the Apocalypse?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Checkmate!
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,What are you cooking for tonight...
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Now are you sorry you took a bite out of my grilled cheese?
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,Do you think we can still call our Representative and complain?
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"Your frustration notwithstanding, Bert, they clearly said they'd call our names when it was our turn."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,So did you hear that Nick is The Bachelor?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,It's 2am at the bar all over again.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,"Your love is intoxicating, or that could be the asbestos."
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,And so it goes.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Some idiot named Joe Dator is asking people to say something funny about our desolation.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,He thought they were fake numbers created by a 400 lb guy sitting in his bedroom.

5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"Dorothy, I am leaving you."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"Don't blame me, I voted for Jill Stein."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Don't blame me. I voted for Her

5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,Are you sure waiting here for a taxi is a good idea?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"So, does the #3 usually run late this time of day?"
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I told you they didn't like us.
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,"Nice to meet you Eve, my name is Adam."
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,Is your apartment rent stabilized?
5072,3,3,58,64,1.140625,0.05836388443166186,553,I asked you to turn off the death ray.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Don't you think our relationship is affecting other people?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,The first 100 days have certainly gone well.

5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,So I said if you really are Thor prove it.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,Now you're just being a jerk.
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,I told you we were late.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,"You're right, dear. I shouldn't have kept saying, ""don't worry, 2017 will be way better."""

5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,After all these years... Alone with each other...
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,How's life been treating you?
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"Well, at least now he can build his wall."
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,"When I said ""this means war"" I meant it!"

5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,No more Tweets from the Tower!
5072,1,7,56,64,1.140625,0.04913531839612815,553,That vacuum salesman seemed a bit odd.
5072,2,5,57,64,1.140625,0.053947300765845876,553,I told you nothing would happen.
5072,0,9,55,64,1.140625,0.043797805514170944,553,I knew we never should have given him the nuclear code
