355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,So which one is the birdbrain?
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,"""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer"" is what I said...Didn't think he'd take it so literally..."
355,3,5,13,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1635768003554064,519,Obviously another severe case of Stockholm Syndrome.
355,4,3,14,21,1.5238095238095237,0.17753668459340238,519,We're safe....were the two in the bush.
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,Safer than us when you think about it.
355,3,5,13,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1635768003554064,519,"Well, they do say to keep your friends close and your enemies closer."
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,Wait for it...Wait for it...
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,"No, it's true. As long as you're sitting there, he can't shoot you."
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,"So, which is it? A bird mocking or a mocking bird?"
355,4,3,14,21,1.5238095238095237,0.17753668459340238,519,It’s the same trick we used to get Dick Chaney to shoot his friend in the face.
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,"Oh, we've got to Tweet this."
355,3,5,13,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1635768003554064,519,You have to admire his stance on gun control.
355,3,5,13,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1635768003554064,519,She's never had much luck picking a boyfriend.
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,He's from Compton. Nothing scares him.
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,Kevin is so cocky when he's out of season.
355,5,1,15,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1904761904761905,519,Now there's a shotgun with a bird's-eye view.
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,"I admit it, I have perch envy"
355,3,5,13,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1635768003554064,519,"Obviously, we have our own Benedict Arnold!"
355,1,9,11,21,1.5238095238095237,0.13127665478181166,519,She's always liked living on the edge....
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,That's the safest place in the forest.
355,1,9,11,21,1.5238095238095237,0.13127665478181166,519,You have to admire her willingness to reach across the aisle.
355,3,5,13,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1635768003554064,519,"There's brave, and then there's stupid."
355,4,3,14,21,1.5238095238095237,0.17753668459340238,519,Our little Tweetie always has loved to ride shotgun.
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,"No, you go talk to her."
355,2,7,12,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1483086809752137,519,"Oh, look. Jerry caught another hunter."
355,3,5,13,21,1.5238095238095237,0.1635768003554064,519,Guess he couldn't afford a bird dog.
355,4,3,14,21,1.5238095238095237,0.17753668459340238,519,"They're actually very compatible, aside from the hunting."
355,4,3,14,21,1.5238095238095237,0.17753668459340238,519,Dead bird riding.
355,1,9,11,21,1.5238095238095237,0.13127665478181166,519,They say that's the safest place to be during hunting season.
389,3,6,14,23,1.5217391304347827,0.15231501081421103,519,That's the worst decoy placement I've ever seen.
389,2,8,13,23,1.5217391304347827,0.13873461482042881,519,"And that's how the expression ""bird-brain"" originated."
389,3,6,14,23,1.5217391304347827,0.15231501081421103,519,I don't understand adrenalin junkies at all.
389,2,8,13,23,1.5217391304347827,0.13873461482042881,519,I told you a bird on the man is worth two in the bush.
389,4,4,15,23,1.5217391304347827,0.1647799492938801,519,Don't worry - he won't sing.
394,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,519,Apparently it's a performance art piece.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"Okay, so which one's dumber?"
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,Don't you just love deer season.
394,0,10,10,20,1.5,0.11470786693528089,519,It's no surprise... all of her tweets support the NRA
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,I disagree with where she stands on gun control
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,"Play ""chicken"" too many times, and you'll eventually find yourself over a barrel."
394,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,519,Those human decoys get more life-like every year.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,Balls like ostrich eggs.
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,You gotta give her credit – it’s the safest place to be.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,I have been warning Simon about hitchhiking for years.
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,"Uh oh, looks like Helen is off her meds."
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,Riding shotgun again!
394,1,9,12,22,1.5,0.12741179785940637,519,Is that Chipper riding shotgun?
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,"Don't you think Junior has taken ""riding shotgun"" to an extreme."
394,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,519,Not exactly a bird in hand but I think we might be safe.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,That's why I gave up internet dating.
394,4,3,15,22,1.5,0.17094086468945693,519,He has Stockholm Syndrome.
394,1,9,12,22,1.5,0.12741179785940637,519,I told him not to call Uber!
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,Well she did ask if she could ride shotgun.
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,Now that's riding shotgun!
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,Should we tweet about this?
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,This certainly does not speak well for either species.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,He always liked to be close to the action.
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,Our daughter does this just to upset us !
394,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,519,We should Tweet about this.
394,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,519,Looks like another fraternity hazing lawsuit to me.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,All we are saying is give peeps a chance
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,He's always been pro-gun.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,Everyone says they all go through a rebellious phase...but I'm really starting to worry...
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,Should we tell him it's not a tree?
394,3,3,12,18,1.5,0.1852396434087371,519,"Ok, if he can stay there for another two minutes, he's in the club."
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,I think we pushed Jr. out of the nest too early.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,It's not clear which is actually the decoy.....
394,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,519,He's no birdbrain! He knows you need to keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
394,4,3,15,22,1.5,0.17094086468945693,519,"""What!!! You forgot the camera???"
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,You just know he's going to tweet about this.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,That's why I never ride shotgun.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,I knew he had a mole on the inside.
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,"If this isn't worth a tweet, what is?"
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,It's called hiding in plain sight.
394,4,2,14,20,1.5,0.18496087779795348,519,"Let's remain ""Two In The Bush""."
394,1,9,12,22,1.5,0.12741179785940637,519,What a lark!
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"Not that they ever ask, but I would have recommended the hawk scope."
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,"Well, I guess in theory that is the safest place to be."
394,0,10,10,20,1.5,0.11470786693528089,519,He's our early warning system
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,It was a triple dog dare.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,"Are we the two in the bush, and he is the bird in the hand or is he just an idiot?"
394,1,7,10,18,1.5,0.14574577203253436,519,"No, no, if he was in his hand he'd be worth as much as us."
394,1,9,12,22,1.5,0.12741179785940637,519,He won't be so cocky when bird season opens tomorrow.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,High tweeson.
394,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,519,Today's youth ! They think they're immortal.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,Just ignore him. You wanna go poop on a statue?
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,Exposure therapy.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,"It's bold, it's daring, and it just might work."
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,Branch Recognition was never Sam's strong subject in school.
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,Bob's feeling cocky again.
394,4,3,15,22,1.5,0.17094086468945693,519,"Damn it Larry, this is not how you ride shotgun."
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"I think the expression is ""in hand"" but I still like our odds."
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,"Looks easy, but I still prefer flying to riding shotgun."
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,He's been like that ever since his wife flew south without him.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,I dared him. I didn't think he'd really do it.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,"Well, he's definitely from your side of the family."
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,He is . . . The Most Interesting Bird in the World.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,Can you believe the balls on that tit?
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,I'm thrilled he knows we're out of season.
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,Now that's something to tweet about.
394,4,2,14,20,1.5,0.18496087779795348,519,One of them is going to learn the hard way.
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,It's times like this I'm glad the two of us are in the bush.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,Who taught him how to ride shotgun?
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"It looks dangerous, but it's actually not a bad strategy."
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,He's checking it off his buckshot list.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,"well, can you think of a safer spot?"
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,He’s a mockingbird
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,I'm pretty sure that's a yellow-bellied ass kisser.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,This duel is going to be quick
394,4,2,14,20,1.5,0.18496087779795348,519,That's ten paces each. This duel looks like a draw.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,No one takes him seriously when he forgets his glasses.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"Holy Stockholm Syndrome, Robin!!"
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,He says it's a better adrenaline rush than high-voltage power lines.
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"Yes, it's all over Twitter."
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,He's using the hide in plain sight strategy.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,There's a good reason why they call them larks.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,"He's always was saying ""carpe diem!"" but that just looks carpe dumb to me."
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"Where did we go wrong, Dear?"
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,Keep your enemies closer...
394,4,3,15,22,1.5,0.17094086468945693,519,Let's see who is more surprised.
394,3,4,13,20,1.5,0.17013926184468015,519,"I dare you to yell ""PULL."""
394,1,8,11,20,1.5,0.13572417850765922,519,From the day he was hatched I knew he would be different.
394,2,5,11,18,1.5,0.16666666666666666,519,"Wow, that Brass Balled Warbler really lives up to its name."
394,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,519,"This gives a whole new meaning to ""riding shotgun."""
394,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,519,Harry's riding shotgun this season.
394,3,5,14,22,1.5,0.15777127397525473,519,I don't think he noticed us giving him the bird.
486,2,7,14,23,1.4782608695652173,0.13873461482042881,519,That's one 'double dare' I never thought he'd take!
486,1,9,13,23,1.4782608695652173,0.1236718406890278,519,Adrenaline junkie.

486,2,7,14,23,1.4782608695652173,0.13873461482042881,519,"Et tu, Blue Jay?"
486,2,7,14,23,1.4782608695652173,0.13873461482042881,519,In this case I'd rather be the 'two in the bush.'
486,3,5,15,23,1.4782608695652173,0.15231501081421103,519,Talk about hiding in plain sight!
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,That ''Look at the birdie'' trick won't work on me.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,Why is it always our kid?
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,He likes keeping his friends close but his enemies closer.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"Hey look, Janie's got a gun!"
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,He's been riding shotgun since the day he could chirp.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"You ever ride shot-gun, Earl?"
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,How many times have I told Junior not to hitch-hike!?
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,I always figured he was a right-winger.
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,It's a wonder they even evolved.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,Interesting camouflage.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,So you think he'll talk?
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,Probably the safest place in the forest.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,He says he's worth two of us.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,He used to work as the canary in the coal mine.
492,4,2,15,21,1.4761904761904763,0.17753668459340238,519,He'll realize it's not a branch eventually . . . right honey?
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,That's a chick who likes to live dangerously.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,"I said to hide in plain sight, not on a gun sight."
492,4,2,15,21,1.4761904761904763,0.17753668459340238,519,"You realize we're two in the bush, right?"
492,4,2,15,21,1.4761904761904763,0.17753668459340238,519,Ever since the mine closed he was out of work.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,I don't actually think it has anything to do with hunting anymore
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,I thought he wanted to go for a drive when he called shotgun.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,I told you Bob was part Dodo.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,That's got to be worth three of us.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,"She's cute, but I don't like the position she's taken."
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,Talk about endangered species!
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,He always was a little Cuckoo.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"Geeze, another attempt at gun control!"
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,"Bob's nearsighted. Luckily, so's Edwin."
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,It looks like Frankie's lasik didn't go well
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"Believe it or not, he is a sitting duck."
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,Best mocking bird in the business
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,I' guessing the NRA liked his tweets
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,He joined the NRA.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"He's pro-gun, but I like his stance on migration."
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"She keeps her friends close, but her enemies closer."
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,I see Tweety is riding shotgun again.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,We forgot one lesson.
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,Hopefully that finch doesn't flinch.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,I wonder which bird-brain will turn around first...
492,4,2,15,21,1.4761904761904763,0.17753668459340238,519,"This ought to be good. I told him he's a protected species, but he completely isn't."
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,I think they call it Stockholm Syndrome
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,She always goes for the bad boys
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,"Be more specific, they're both peckers."
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,I think he’s about to send his last tweet.
492,4,2,15,21,1.4761904761904763,0.17753668459340238,519,He'll do anything to avoid flying south for the winter.
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,Some say 'brave' but I say 'stuffed'
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,You should see him during deer hunting season.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,He always said he wanted to play chicken.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,They met online.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"Sometimes I think he takes ""Keep your enemy closer"" too literally."
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,He said he wanted to take a stand on gun control. I'm not sure he understands the issue.
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,"I agree, Steve definitely needs glasses."
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,He must've called shotgun
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,Stay close to your friends...but stay closer to your enemies.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,He's a senator from Vermont.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,"Believe me, with this strategy he'll learn to fly in no time."
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,It's a dream come true for him. He's always wanted to ride shotgun.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"""Now that, my friend, is proof that ignorance is not always bliss""."
492,4,2,15,21,1.4761904761904763,0.17753668459340238,519,He self-identifies as a bloodhound.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,These kids today with their extreme sports.
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,It was on his bucket list.
492,0,10,11,21,1.4761904761904763,0.11167656571008168,519,We may not have covered every single thing before pushing him out of the nest..
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,I think Harold has taken this “Bird in the Hand” thing just a little too far…
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,Tweet that.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,We have met the enemy and he is us.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,It should be o.k. We're the two in the bush.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,"Yep, I taught him how to ride shotgun all right."
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,Cataracts.
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,Performance artists are the worst.
492,1,8,12,21,1.4761904761904763,0.13127665478181166,519,Now there's a guy who lives on the edge!
492,3,4,14,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1635768003554064,519,oh to be young and fearless again
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,He's farsighted
492,2,6,13,21,1.4761904761904763,0.1483086809752137,519,Must be first day of rabbit season.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,Pfft. Show-off.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,I bet he thinks he's worth two of us.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,Why would anyone want to ride shotgun?
565,4,1,14,19,1.4736842105263157,0.19298245614035087,519,That decoy looks like Frank.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,Remember to keep your friends close but your enemies closer.
565,3,3,13,19,1.4736842105263157,0.17718429716424697,519,Uh oh... How many birds in the bush is one on the barrel worth?
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,It’s amazing anyone survives adolescence.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,I always took him for a stool pigeon.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,I think that the term 'riding shotgun' seems to get lost in translation for birds.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,I always new he was a sympathizer!
565,1,7,11,19,1.4736842105263157,0.14035087719298245,519,I've always had my doubts about that one...
565,1,7,11,19,1.4736842105263157,0.14035087719298245,519,I told you that chick was a snitch.
565,1,7,11,19,1.4736842105263157,0.14035087719298245,519,Hide in plain sight. Brilliant.
565,3,3,13,19,1.4736842105263157,0.17718429716424697,519,I don't think he understands how to use a decoy.
565,1,7,11,19,1.4736842105263157,0.14035087719298245,519,That takes the meaning of oblivious to a whole new level.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,"They say ""keep your enemies closer"", but, really?"
565,3,3,13,19,1.4736842105263157,0.17718429716424697,519,Be still! Ol' Grimsby's got a Snitch.
565,1,7,11,19,1.4736842105263157,0.14035087719298245,519,Didn't I tell you he was a bad egg?
565,1,7,11,19,1.4736842105263157,0.14035087719298245,519,She's going through a peaceful protest phase.
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,Should we warn him or just tweet about it?
565,2,5,12,19,1.4736842105263157,0.15983216805516315,519,"It's a changing world, Mildred."
565,3,3,13,19,1.4736842105263157,0.17718429716424697,519,Kids are calling it 'rifling'; say it's a real rush
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,Charlie takes the old guy for a walk every day.
587,3,4,15,22,1.4545454545454546,0.15745916432444337,519,I am definitely tweeting this.
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,Are you sure it's 'just a phase'?
587,3,4,15,22,1.4545454545454546,0.15745916432444337,519,Look at our little son on a gun!
587,3,4,15,22,1.4545454545454546,0.15745916432444337,519,That's the last time Ned gets to ride shotgun.
587,1,8,13,22,1.4545454545454546,0.12702511472832215,519,Someone should tell him there are no free rides.
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,There goes Benedict Cardinal.
587,4,2,16,22,1.4545454545454546,0.17065284280889198,519,Have your friends close but your enemies even closer
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,He'd be a lot safer if he learned how to fly..
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,"When I said to junior, ""Hunt or be hunted"" yesterday, I didn't think he'd take it literally!"
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,That's one game bird.
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,He just hasn't been the same since the migration over the NRA convention
587,3,4,15,22,1.4545454545454546,0.15745916432444337,519,He's clearly the one who's 'cuckoo.'
587,3,4,15,22,1.4545454545454546,0.15745916432444337,519,"46, 47, 48 - he just might make a new personal best"
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,He always was a bit cuckoo.
587,1,8,13,22,1.4545454545454546,0.12702511472832215,519,The kids are playing chicken again.
587,2,6,14,22,1.4545454545454546,0.14305378044898964,519,Looks like we found our bird sanctuary.

824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,"Well, that one certainly isn't worth two of us."
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,Now that's what we call a dodo bird.
824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,I'll bet you ten to one that the decoy is the one holding the gun.

824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,"A swift, he's not."
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,The new NRA publicists are on to something.
824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,Remember--he's more scared of us than we are of him.
824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,He's been like that since Susan left.
824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,He'll be OK as long as he keeps his mouth shut

824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,You wanna tell him or should I?
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,I hope that counts as a bird in hand.
824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,"He says he's a spy, but I say he's a sellout."
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,Can’t decide which one is dumber.

824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,Now why didn't I think of that?
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,Now that's definitely worth two in the bush.
824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,Early bird gets the slug

824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,He thinks an enemy kept close at hand is better than two friends in bush.
824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,That's the last place he'll look

824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,ignorance is bliss
824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,I hate how he insists on riding shotgun all of the time
824,1,7,14,22,1.4090909090909092,0.12585793731694053,519,Now that's Chutzpah!

824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,We let him learn through trial and error
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,"I don't know what that's worth, but it definitely isn't two in the bush."
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,I find the new gunsight offensive.
824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,I told her hitchhiking was dangerous!
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,I think we found the source of all the NRA Tweets.
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,Seems like he's everywhere now after that Bernie Sanders podium thing.
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,"It appears our friend has gone ""cuckoo""!"
824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,I heard that he got laid off at the coal mine

824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,"Not to worry, he's hunting wabbits."
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,She turned.
824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,"I'd say he's a sitting duck, but that would be racist."
824,2,5,15,22,1.4090909090909092,0.14201839569111904,519,I'm not following his tweets.
824,3,3,16,22,1.4090909090909092,0.15651910121031104,519,This isn't sitting well with the dog unions.

890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,You think it's camouflage?
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,Looks like a suicide by hunter.
890,0,8,12,20,1.4,0.11239029738980325,519,Hard to tell which one is the cuckoo.
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,Old dude with his sights set on a young chick.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,"Well, I'll be darned. Hiding in plain sight works!"
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"He's good looking, but kind of a dodo."
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,That's why we call him Robin the Boy Wonder.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Is that worth two in the bush?
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,I'm following the NRA's every tweet.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,There's a good example of keeping your enemies closer.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Embedded journalism.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"If you can't tweet 'em, join 'em!"
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Hindsight is tweety-tweety.
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,There's no way she's worth the two of us.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,"You see, Bob, this is what Xanax does to people."
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,It's his poise that I admire.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,I can't believe you tricked him into thinking that's a pear tree.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,And now we end our tour of the forest with the oblivious hunter...
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,It always amazes me that I have friends in the NRA.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,He thinks riding shotgun is safer.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,I thought you called Shotgun.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,That decoy is never going to work.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,His last tweet was was against gun control.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,I regret telling him that he's special.
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,He will never be able to outdo his Bernie stunt.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,He's taking his stand on guns a little too far this time.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,It's the new Duck Dynasty decoy
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,I guess. we can't call him chicken anymore.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,He lost the bet.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,Now that's what I call living on the edge.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,"Honey, are you sure that marching him off to military school is really the best plan?"
890,0,8,12,20,1.4,0.11239029738980325,519,Are you sure you taught him everything you know?
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Bird-brains of a feather flock together.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,"We can only hope this ""keep your friends close and your enemies closer"" thing works out for Freddie."
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Our tweety's riding shotgun.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"Yes, he's a son of a bitch , but he's our son of a bitch."
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,I always knew Tony was a stool pigeon.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Bob! That's not your Uber!
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,I told him Trump won New York
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,Ernie's getting pretty brazen with his support of open carry.
890,0,8,12,20,1.4,0.11239029738980325,519,"Talk about ""out on a limb""!"
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,She says that they are just friends!
890,4,0,16,20,1.4,0.1835325870964494,519,He called it first.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,"Looks like a stool pigeon, from here."
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"Apparently, he used to be a wedding photographer"
890,0,8,12,20,1.4,0.11239029738980325,519,"His father told him ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."""
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,He's been insufferable ever since he found out nobody hunts robins.
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,It makes them both feel macho.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,And I thought planking was a stupid craze.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,So much for last week's intervention
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Songbirds have brass and a penchant for irony.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,This isn't going to end well.
890,0,8,12,20,1.4,0.11239029738980325,519,She'll never live to tell the quail.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Told ya. . . we got nuthin' to worry about . . .
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,What makes you think they're intelligent?
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"In this case, I'm inclined to think that two in the bush are better."
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"Awww, she always calls shotgun!"
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,He just loves a good practical joke.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,All in all I'd rather be two in the bush.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,That's Louise. She handles his twitter account.
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,I wonder how many followers he has.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Bernie told him guns are safer in rural America.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,It's one of those new sights that gives you a bird's eye view.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,"""He'll do anything for attention""."
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"So naïve, must be a Republican."
890,0,8,12,20,1.4,0.11239029738980325,519,Can't wait to tweet about this ... little Petey riding shotgun!
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,He's actually safer there.
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,Apparently our son has jumped the gun.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Apparently riding shotgun was high on his bucket list.
890,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,519,He must feel a lot safer with somebody riding shotgun.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"I know, it's crazy, but he says he's hiding in plain sight."
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,Now that's what I'd call a bird brain!
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,"If you think about it, that is actually the safest place to be."
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,I knew we couldn't trust him.
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,"They seem happy, but i can't see them staying together"
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,So much for birds of a feather flocking together!
890,1,6,13,20,1.4,0.1337712108119877,519,I have no clue why Doug insists on riding shotgun.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,I told him taking the stock option was risky.
890,2,4,14,20,1.4,0.1521771820505364,519,Show-off!

1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,He plans to live-tweet every shot.
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,I see Frank's been working through his trust issues.
1197,3,1,16,20,1.35,0.1666228012450182,519,Looks like Elmer has a new twitter follower.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"If he looks at you and says watch the birdie, fly!"
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,He must be a mocking bird.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,That's one helluva decoy!
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Just because it's different doesn't mean it's wrong.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"Live by the gun, die by the gun."
1197,3,1,16,20,1.35,0.1666228012450182,519,She had better poop.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Look at the pecker on that one.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Well....he is an NRA member!
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,I'd say he's fallen pretty far from the tree ...
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Riding shotgun is for the birds.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Sometimes I wish I was a mocking bird.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Elmer just isn't the same since that silly rabbit left.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Wonder what that's worth..
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"We should have been more specific with our ""Where to Land"" instructions"
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,I knew it...he sold us out...
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,I had a hunch Phil was sleeping with the enemy.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,It's your fault he's overconfident!
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,I thought he wanted the front seat when he said shotgun
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Tim's always got to jump the gun.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,His NRA membership is clearly paying off.
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,He's been live tweeting the hunter's movements all morning.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"He's no threat, a little bird told me."
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Looks like he has developed Stockholm Syndrome.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,I would like to believe that's fake.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,She supports the Second Amendment.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Kurtz has gone rogue.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,He'll never look there...
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Rumor has it that she's a double agent.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,His tweet just went viral
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,That hare-brained son of ours is always pushing the envelope.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,I've got to 'tweet' this!
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,The Millennium Pigeon. Classic.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"Canaries are brave. Not very bright, but brave."
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Uber comes to the jungle.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"Apparently he just finished the first Chapter in Sun Tzu’s book, Keep Your Friends Close and Your Enemies Closer."
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Looks like Stockholm syndrome to me
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Riding shotgun sure looks cool.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Not a peep
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,I've heard ' Keep your enemy close ' was the enemy's idea.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,You know he was voted 'most likely to be in the hand' in high school.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Best seat in the house.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Phew-- glad that's better than 2 in the bush.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Which one do you think is going to be more surprised?
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,I remember when being a bird brain stood for something.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"Last time it was the coal mine, now it's riding shotgun."
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,He's probably not in season.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Don't fall for her mating call--I think it could be a trap.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,This is one time when being two birds in a bush beats all other options hands down.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,I keep telling him it's time for contact lenses.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Cheney's out again
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,He started off as a bad egg.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,I hadn't heard of Stockholm Syndrome before.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"Not too bright, but our boy's sure got some moxie."
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,She's doesn't give a shoot.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,"No, you tell him NRA doesn't mean National Robin Association!"
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"But is it ""Ha Ha"" funny?"
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Maybe we shouldn't have lined the nest with 'Field and Stream.'
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,He always calls 'shotgun' first.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Trust Ted to land on the safest place in the forest.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Nobody's aim can be that bad.
1197,3,1,16,20,1.35,0.1666228012450182,519,I told her if she feeds and takes care of him we can keep him.
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,It's part of their mating ritual. Which explains the whole endangered thing.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"Behold, the yellow-bellied tern-coat in his natural environment."
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,She's always protesting something.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,Poor turnout at the sit-in.
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"He turned to me and said, ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer,"" and then just took off!"
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,We need to review the lesson on situation awareness
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,who would have thought he was worth two of us
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,"I don't care what he's worth Carl, I'm staying here."
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,I hear he's loaded.
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Why am I so attracted to him?
1197,0,7,13,20,1.35,0.10942433098048307,519,Wow! A Nonetoo Swift. You understandably don't see many of those.
1197,3,1,16,20,1.35,0.1666228012450182,519,Tell me more about Maslow
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,"Come to think of it, that's a pretty safe place to be."
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Teenagers
1197,1,5,14,20,1.35,0.13128915456069915,519,They're both bird brains
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,Hillary is still the safer choice.
1197,3,1,16,20,1.35,0.1666228012450182,519,I don't think I can watch when they reach ten paces!
1197,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,519,He thinks the guy is Elmer Fudd.
1280,0,8,15,23,1.3478260869565217,0.10154334054280736,519,Now that's hootspa.

1280,1,6,16,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1194303947014872,519,With balls that big he won't be able to fly away
1280,1,6,16,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1194303947014872,519,A bird on the gun is worth two in the bush.
1280,2,4,17,23,1.3478260869565217,0.13496736030801482,519,"I knew our girl would bring us honor. First, that noble call for peace on Bernie's podium, and now fearlessly standing up to the gun lobby. What injustice will she challenge next?"
1280,3,2,18,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1488917644414021,519,She's getting paid to live tweet his hunt.
1280,1,6,16,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1194303947014872,519,Where is the loyalty?
1280,2,4,17,23,1.3478260869565217,0.13496736030801482,519,Don't worry it's deer season
1280,1,6,16,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1194303947014872,519,"Well, I, for one, say she is relying too much on her membership card to the NRA."
1280,2,4,17,23,1.3478260869565217,0.13496736030801482,519,He's too old for her.
1280,1,6,16,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1194303947014872,519,"Look at her, acting like she's better than two of us in the bush!"
1280,1,6,16,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1194303947014872,519,He's literally riding shotgun.
1280,1,6,16,23,1.3478260869565217,0.1194303947014872,519,Maybe WE should join the N.R.A..
1280,0,8,15,23,1.3478260869565217,0.10154334054280736,519,Yea! Keep your enemies close.
1280,2,4,17,23,1.3478260869565217,0.13496736030801482,519,He always gets to sit shotgun.
1280,2,4,17,23,1.3478260869565217,0.13496736030801482,519,Hope he doesn't see us or he'll sing like a…….never mind.
1280,2,4,17,23,1.3478260869565217,0.13496736030801482,519,"Well, I guess what you don't know may actually hurt you."

1604,2,2,16,20,1.3,0.14689774459950383,519,There aren't any NRA supporters on my side of the family..
1604,1,4,15,20,1.3,0.12773327473170104,519,He was always a show off.
1604,1,4,15,20,1.3,0.12773327473170104,519,Relax! He's the cover-boy for the NRA.

2540,1,2,16,19,1.2105263157894737,0.12280701754385967,519,"No, we don't always have to flock together."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,He hasn't been the same since Tiananmen Square.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,There is the traitor!
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Lemme know when you spot the two that bullied you.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Yup. Two in the bush. Definitely.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,His eye is not upon the sparrow.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I told you he's a bad shooter.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Glad to see he's putting all that unpheasantness behind him.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Maybe he's hunting wabbits.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"As you said before, not every kernel pops."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"Apparently, she's a daughter of a gun."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I guess the early bird gets the buck
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I don't think all is Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah satisfactual...
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"Ever since we were kids, he's always been first to call shotgun."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I guess that's why it's called a 'murder' of crows...
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"""Give us a TWEET when you get there."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I hear he's got his own bird bath.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,See that Judith? They call that the 1%
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,That's the latest Tweet from the NRA
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,A pilot bird. They never go extinct.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Larry likes to live on the edge.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,He just has no foresight!
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"But he's not in hand, so how could we be..."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,They're replacing us with younger birds who don't know sh*t from shinola.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Jeez. And I thought Fudd didn't have a clue.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"So, it is true. The NRA is for the birds."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Clueless fearless youth.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"They shoot horses, don't they?"
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"No, it's a bird in the HAND is worth two in the bush."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,It's better than his hand or the bush.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"That bird just tweeted ""Guns don't hurt you""."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Do you think our scout may have made a deal with the enemy?
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,What a cuckoo!
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"Do you think that's what they mean when they say, "" Keep your friends close, and your enemy closer."" ?"
2591,2,0,18,20,1.2,0.13764944032233706,519,He was a bird dog in a former life.
2591,2,0,18,20,1.2,0.13764944032233706,519,"Look at those pair of tits, Gerald."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Doesn't surprise me. He's a strict Constitutionalist.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,It looks unsafe until you take into account the fact that he has no depth perception whatsoever.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"""Time to re-tweet""."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I still say dam that 2nd amendment.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Hold on Bob... Who's on which team now?
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"""Who would have guessed that Bob would go over to the dark side""?"
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"Well that's one way to ""flip him the bird."""
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,That's not the kind of shoot we taught her to sit on.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"He is getting too smart for his own good , that boy of yours !"
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,You know what they say: a bird on a gun is worth two in the bush.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,I always suspected that Sparrow boy was hanging with the wrong crowd--there's the smoking gun!
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"Duck, duck, goose."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I'm going to twitter about it.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I guess a bird on the rifle beats two in the bush!
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"Shush, that's the new bird-drone decoy."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"He's the ""little bird that told him""."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"There goes Merv, proving there's no magic bullet for stupidity."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,It's a trap!
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"We really have raised him to be bold, but this seems quite heedless"
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,We should be getting a tweet soon.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,I told you that there was a spy in our midst.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,I like her style.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,He always was a risk-taker.
2591,2,0,18,20,1.2,0.13764944032233706,519,It's like Moby-Dick was stuck to the bottom of the Pequod.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,He learned that trick by watching Looney Toons.
2591,2,0,18,20,1.2,0.13764944032233706,519,"For such a pretty little thing, she sure knows how to rub it in."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"See, I told you that dog wasn't gonna last if he kept laughing at him."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"Next up is Trevor, attempting the reverse piggy-back, otherwise known as ""Look behind you, stupid""."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,My compliments. He's your most lifelike decoy yet.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"I heard he turned, and become a scout."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,I can't wait until we're out of season.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"Either he's one of those trained 'rear guard' service birds or he can't stand looking at that stupid hat."""
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Looks like Cindy has broken the glass ceiling at retriever school!
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Whar hubris even for a stool pigeon!
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"Well, he is a purebred stool pigeon."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"As all wrens, he likes to brag."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Larry always did like living on the edge.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,She'll do anything to get out of the nest and have fun and games with a guy she hasn't even met!
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,She was anti NRA until he told her it meant No Robins Allowed.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"You know, Chirpee always has Elmer's back."
2591,2,0,18,20,1.2,0.13764944032233706,519,He's a strong believer in the right to arm birds.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,He's trying to see who has been shooting at us.
2591,2,0,18,20,1.2,0.13764944032233706,519,At least he didn't get into marijuana.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I think she's drunk.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"''Well a bird in hand ...is worth us.""marshek3"
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,We don't need to be quiet - he's hunting wabbits.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Clearly a textbook example of a symbiotic relationship
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,That's one ballsy bird.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"He was triple-dog dared, so yeah..."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,His Twitter feed isn't nearly as interesting as you'd think it would be.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Quid pro quo?
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I have decided to take a different approach.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,One's cuckoo and the other's a bird brain
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"Call me a dove, but the new background check law looks to be toothless."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,He's a big supporter of gun control.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I heard he donated a great deal of birdseed to her foundation.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,It's his way of 'flipping the bird.' He calls it the gun barrel boogie.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"Looks like our son, Dan Quail, is standing firm."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,She's waiting for him to reply to her tweet
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Do you think he really doesn't know the difference between bird shot and bird seed?
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Our kid is bird-brained
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"...No , it's still too close for comfort ."
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,You guys take the bush. I'll take the barrel.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Wow. Ted was not lying when he said the hunter's eyesight was bad...
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,Look whose singing praises about the 2nd amendment.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"Ignorance is bliss, so let's keep quiet."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Have gun will travel.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I taught him to stay very close to his enemies.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,What a traitor.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Send him another tweet.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"I can't tell if she's trying to be edgy, or is she edgy?"
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Let's see how many of us they say HE'S worth.
2591,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,519,"He may be crazy, but I tell you, embedded journalists get all the chicks."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,This is going south real quick.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,"The game’s out there, and it’s play or get played."
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,Touch the butt!
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,I don't trust his Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.
2591,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,519,That must be Bernie Sanders' bird.
2704,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,519,He claims to be a bird-watcher.
2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,At least that way he won't get shot accidentally
2704,2,0,19,21,1.1904761904761905,0.13127665478181164,519,"Ever since Henderson joined the NRA, he's just been impossible."
2704,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,519,Watch him spin like a top when Harry does duck quack imitation !
2704,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,519,He's got to learn to fly some day.

2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,What a sight.
2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,I tried to tell him but he insisted he knew the meaning of shotgun.
2704,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,519,"Look, he's a teenager. All teenagers are birdbrains."
2704,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,519,"They call it a ""poop site""."

2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,Looks like he's gone over to the dark side.
2704,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,519,I didn't know Stacy was pro second amendment did you?
2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,His wife left because he was shooting blanks
2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,"Ever since that Sanders thing, he keeps asking, 'Have Marty Scorsese's people called today?'"

2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,He's definitely not worth more than us.
2704,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,519,I guess he got tired of tree branches.
