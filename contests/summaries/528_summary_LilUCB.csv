1,10,7,25,42,1.6428571428571428,0.13120290680572758,528,Welcome to Weight Watchers!
2,4,17,19,40,1.625,0.10553587310872314,528,We're here today to discuss firing the architect.
3,8,7,22,37,1.6216216216216217,0.1361821302507295,528,This meeting is getting away from me.
4,7,12,23,42,1.619047619047619,0.1178217957529481,528,I am entertaining a motion to evacuate. Do I hear a second?
5,7,9,23,39,1.5897435897435896,0.1257525187645929,528,The captain assures me it was a very small iceberg.
5,5,13,21,39,1.5897435897435896,0.11451917151728358,528,Welcome to orientation.
5,6,11,22,39,1.5897435897435896,0.1202670707647033,528,Many of you are concerned with the direction our company is heading.
5,5,13,21,39,1.5897435897435896,0.11451917151728358,528,Can someone straighten out that picture?
9,7,8,24,39,1.564102564102564,0.12616459802990815,528,I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.
9,7,8,24,39,1.564102564102564,0.12616459802990815,528,"Well, maybe now you will appreciate the gravity of the situation."
11,7,6,23,36,1.5555555555555556,0.13478050612923034,528,I see we have reached the tipping point.
11,5,10,21,36,1.5555555555555556,0.12243848111540882,528,"As you may have guessed, I've highly leveraged the company."
11,6,8,22,36,1.5555555555555556,0.12875745898840155,528,"It can't be that bad, the band's still playing."
14,3,15,20,38,1.5526315789473684,0.10463897441171459,528,Can anyone bring something to the table?
14,6,9,23,38,1.5526315789473684,0.12335615220163265,528,"First, I'd like to thank you all for not joining the lawsuit against my brother's architectural firm..."
14,6,9,23,38,1.5526315789473684,0.12335615220163265,528,This meeting of the Fox News editorial board will now come to order.
17,6,5,20,31,1.5483870967741935,0.1454596694458998,528,Everyone seated around this table has an equal vote.
18,3,13,19,35,1.542857142857143,0.11108976719099657,528,"Obviously, we've reached a tipping point."
18,6,7,22,35,1.542857142857143,0.13184442794927856,528,The Architectural Standards Committee meeting will now come to order.
20,4,12,21,37,1.5405405405405406,0.1135992811974639,528,"So, other than the wheels, we like the new chairs?"
20,6,8,23,37,1.5405405405405406,0.12612612612612614,528,Now...Let's see what this button does.
20,6,8,23,37,1.5405405405405406,0.12612612612612614,528,"From where I'm sitting, it's all downhill from here."
23,6,6,22,34,1.5294117647058822,0.1350730581851881,528,I want to level with you all...
23,6,6,22,34,1.5294117647058822,0.1350730581851881,528,What's it going to take to bring you all to the table?
23,6,6,22,34,1.5294117647058822,0.1350730581851881,528,"Unless I get a volunteer, I’m going to let go of this table."
26,4,11,21,36,1.5277777777777777,0.11606040512028341,528,"OK, I'll level with you."
27,6,6,23,35,1.5142857142857142,0.13202640792264095,528,I see the weight of my argument has failed to move you in my direction.
27,6,6,23,35,1.5142857142857142,0.13202640792264095,528,We appear to have reached the tipping point.
27,5,8,22,35,1.5142857142857142,0.12550019968130738,528,The rumors are true. We are a sinking ship.
30,5,7,22,34,1.5,0.12840721766021207,528,"Before we begin, I'd just like to point out that Mr. Gehry was very highly recommended."
30,5,7,22,34,1.5,0.12840721766021207,528,"On second thought, maybe rolling chairs were a bad idea."
32,6,5,24,35,1.4857142857142858,0.13202640792264095,528,"So, then -- all in favor of removing the wheels from our chairs, say 'aye.'d"
32,5,7,23,35,1.4857142857142858,0.12550019968130738,528,Welcome to the Pisa branch offices.
34,5,6,22,33,1.4848484848484849,0.13143448161285967,528,"Unlike you, I do appreciate the gravity of the situation."
34,4,8,21,33,1.4848484848484849,0.124020496543522,528,So its unanimous?
34,2,12,19,33,1.4848484848484849,0.10767174548145378,528,"Is it just me, or does that picture seem crooked?"
37,6,4,24,34,1.4705882352941178,0.1350730581851881,528,Red rover red rover send Sandi on over
37,4,8,22,34,1.4705882352941178,0.12115968248104404,528,"When the OSHA guy gets here, everyone look casual."
37,4,8,22,34,1.4705882352941178,0.12115968248104404,528,"Yes, it's unsinkable. Any other questions?"
37,3,10,21,34,1.4705882352941178,0.1135655646074615,528,The motion to adjourn has been approved by a landslide.
37,5,6,23,34,1.4705882352941178,0.128305104548507,528,Do I need to remind you what rolls downhill?
37,5,6,23,34,1.4705882352941178,0.128305104548507,528,I think I know which way the group is leaning.
43,6,3,23,32,1.46875,0.14187948515007945,528,It appears that the discussion has tilted in my favor.
43,3,9,20,32,1.46875,0.11866507999271488,528,"My name is John, I am an alcoholic...and an architect..."
43,7,1,24,32,1.46875,0.14881504406043655,528,Welcome to New Balance.
46,3,8,19,30,1.4666666666666666,0.12441433680675687,528,"Well, Bill, it looks like you won because of a landslide."
47,4,7,22,33,1.4545454545454546,0.12378889877551663,528,Of course it's not a level playing field. Duh!
47,4,7,22,33,1.4545454545454546,0.12378889877551663,528,I'm here to assure you that fracking does not cause seismic events.
49,3,8,20,31,1.4516129032258065,0.12127201875158436,528,"So exactly how long have things been going downhill?"""
49,3,8,20,31,1.4516129032258065,0.12127201875158436,528,I want to begin by saying the foundation of this company is as solid as ever.
49,3,8,20,31,1.4516129032258065,0.12127201875158436,528,We're selling the engineering division.
49,3,8,20,31,1.4516129032258065,0.12127201875158436,528,First order of business: we fire the architect.
49,6,2,23,31,1.4516129032258065,0.1454596694458998,528,It appears the balance of power has shifted.
49,5,4,22,31,1.4516129032258065,0.1378694230092439,528,I think we're too far to the right on this.
49,3,8,20,31,1.4516129032258065,0.12127201875158436,528,"Clearly, groupthink does not lend itself to a balanced solution."
49,5,4,22,31,1.4516129032258065,0.1378694230092439,528,Let's move on to the next slide.
49,5,4,22,31,1.4516129032258065,0.1378694230092439,528,"Oh my God, it does not smell that bad."
49,3,8,20,31,1.4516129032258065,0.12127201875158436,528,That's ridiculous Evelyn! Does anyone else feel I talk down to you?
59,4,5,20,29,1.4482758620689655,0.1366939598572572,528,"Ok, so no one is on my side."
60,3,6,18,27,1.4444444444444444,0.1343267832948864,528,I move that we table the motion.
61,4,7,23,34,1.4411764705882353,0.12083471180420848,528,"As you all know, moving up in this company can be difficult."
62,3,8,21,32,1.4375,0.11826620464566504,528,Who's got the bowling ball?
62,4,6,22,32,1.4375,0.12650306001654027,528,We have to stop meeting like this.
62,3,8,21,32,1.4375,0.11826620464566504,528,I just wanted to give you my slant on the company's future.
62,4,6,22,32,1.4375,0.12650306001654027,528,I'm beginning to see the gravity of the situation.
62,4,6,22,32,1.4375,0.12650306001654027,528,Guess what rolls downhill?
62,5,4,23,32,1.4375,0.13423543952997827,528,Maybe I came on a little strong there.
68,3,7,20,30,1.4333333333333333,0.12395154163756698,528,"Not so long ago, I was sitting where you people are."
68,2,9,19,30,1.4333333333333333,0.11430281754889884,528,Another uphill battle?
68,4,5,21,30,1.4333333333333333,0.13290159987389974,528,Now you understand why our new cologne isn't selling.
68,3,7,20,30,1.4333333333333333,0.12395154163756698,528,Watch what happens when I let go of this table.
68,2,9,19,30,1.4333333333333333,0.11430281754889884,528,I don't roll that way
68,3,7,20,30,1.4333333333333333,0.12395154163756698,528,Very funny guys. Now straighten the picture and move your chairs back to the table.
68,3,7,20,30,1.4333333333333333,0.12395154163756698,528,I'll keep my presentation brief because I know you all hate slides.
68,6,1,23,30,1.4333333333333333,0.1491996528094735,528,We have to stop having our board meetings on cruise lines.
68,2,9,19,30,1.4333333333333333,0.11430281754889884,528,"Before we get started, would someone straighten the picture?"
68,3,7,20,30,1.4333333333333333,0.12395154163756698,528,Lunch should be here shortly. I ordered sliders.
68,3,7,20,30,1.4333333333333333,0.12395154163756698,528,Anyone know who put a lien on this building?
68,2,9,19,30,1.4333333333333333,0.11430281754889884,528,All in favor of suing the architect...
68,5,3,22,30,1.4333333333333333,0.14128583022990943,528,For our next Board meeting I believe we should seriously consider using TeleMeeting rather than a cruise ship.
68,3,7,20,30,1.4333333333333333,0.12395154163756698,528,So moved?
82,4,4,20,28,1.4285714285714286,0.1401866804179023,528,"So, now you understand the gravity of the situation."
82,3,6,19,28,1.4285714285714286,0.13041013273932525,528,I want you all to know you can always come to me.
84,2,10,21,33,1.4242424242424243,0.1068692119671658,528,I'm inclined to say no.
85,5,3,23,31,1.4193548387096775,0.13736532836706505,528,Vote 'yes' or I let go of the table.
85,5,3,23,31,1.4193548387096775,0.13736532836706505,528,Company benefits will be given on a sliding scale.
85,1,11,19,31,1.4193548387096775,0.10132661496249244,528,I'm sure you're aware of the gravity of the situation.
85,5,3,23,31,1.4193548387096775,0.13736532836706505,528,I think we can agree that the company is a little heavy in upper management.
85,4,5,22,31,1.4193548387096775,0.12930079583275195,528,I want to address the rumors that this company is crooked.
85,2,9,20,31,1.4193548387096775,0.11143437770349775,528,"A simple ""nay"" vote would have sufficed."
85,3,7,21,31,1.4193548387096775,0.12069862537980455,528,The motion to abandon ship passes unanimously.
85,2,9,20,31,1.4193548387096775,0.11143437770349775,528,I grant you. Locating our headquarters on the San Andreas fault has some disadvantages.
85,2,9,20,31,1.4193548387096775,0.11143437770349775,528,Anyone see my pen down there?
94,3,6,20,29,1.4137931034482758,0.1266977453163713,528,It seems the builder didn't level with us.
94,3,6,20,29,1.4137931034482758,0.1266977453163713,528,"As luck would have it, our next agenda item is a report from Building Maintenance."
94,2,8,19,29,1.4137931034482758,0.11657300065220919,528,The motion is carried by a landslide
94,3,6,20,29,1.4137931034482758,0.1266977453163713,528,Now let me get this straight . . .
94,2,8,19,29,1.4137931034482758,0.11657300065220919,528,"As some of you may have noticed, the company is in decline."
94,3,6,20,29,1.4137931034482758,0.1266977453163713,528,It seems your opinion outweighs my logic.
94,4,4,21,29,1.4137931034482758,0.13607120509293727,528,"We are facing an uphill battle, but I would like to get rolling."
94,3,6,20,29,1.4137931034482758,0.1266977453163713,528,I'm just hoping Frank Gehry will give us a partial refund.
94,4,4,21,29,1.4137931034482758,0.13607120509293727,528,There's been a seismic shift in our firm's outlook.
94,1,10,18,29,1.4137931034482758,0.10548085273578256,528,"Here, on the Titanic, there are no dumb questions."
94,3,6,20,29,1.4137931034482758,0.1266977453163713,528,"On the plus side, it has a wonderful view of downtown Pisa."
94,2,8,19,29,1.4137931034482758,0.11657300065220919,528,So now let us adjourn to the life boats.
94,2,8,19,29,1.4137931034482758,0.11657300065220919,528,It is still the view of the board that the ship is not sinking.
107,2,7,18,27,1.4074074074074074,0.12240769834154322,528,"'First, welcome to Pisa.'"
107,3,5,19,27,1.4074074074074074,0.1335389361282959,528,"Because the rent is cheap, and would someone crawl up here and help me hold the table?"
107,2,7,18,27,1.4074074074074074,0.12240769834154322,528,"Sorry, but I'm inclined to disagree."
107,2,7,18,27,1.4074074074074074,0.12240769834154322,528,Why don't we try another angle?
111,4,5,23,32,1.40625,0.12587896612581162,528,To save money we had to let about half of the 34th floor go.
112,1,10,19,30,1.4,0.10283342182227607,528,This company is moving in a new direction.
112,1,10,19,30,1.4,0.10283342182227607,528,"Okay, who hired the architect?"
112,4,4,22,30,1.4,0.13217891045025335,528,I'd like to address the allegations that our reporting leans to the right.
112,4,4,22,30,1.4,0.13217891045025335,528,I'm sure you can all appreciate the gravity of our current situation.
112,2,8,20,30,1.4,0.1134617257862351,528,My cartoonist has been drinking again
112,4,4,22,30,1.4,0.13217891045025335,528,All in favor of moving lifeboat aquisition out of sub-committee?
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,It looks like the balance of power has shifted.
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,Maybe Gehry wasn't the best choice for the interior.
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,It would seem that I have the table.
112,4,4,22,30,1.4,0.13217891045025335,528,You've all been hired to right this ship.
112,4,4,22,30,1.4,0.13217891045025335,528,I think we're at the tipping point.
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,"It will cost too much to straighten the building, so we are just going to take the wheels off the chairs."
112,2,8,20,30,1.4,0.1134617257862351,528,I trust you all understand the gravity of the situation.
112,1,10,19,30,1.4,0.10283342182227607,528,Let me try and put this into perspective.
112,2,8,20,30,1.4,0.1134617257862351,528,And we can begin the meeting as soon as SOMEONE starts holding the magazine straight.
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,Pull up a chair!
112,2,8,20,30,1.4,0.1134617257862351,528,The market slide was more severe than we had anticipated
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,You're in no position to negotiate; things have tilted in my favor!
112,4,4,22,30,1.4,0.13217891045025335,528,"First, let me welcome you all to Pisa."
112,2,8,20,30,1.4,0.1134617257862351,528,"Let's put it to a vote then - All in favor of Mary's proposal to install seatbelts in the restroom, say aye."
112,2,8,20,30,1.4,0.1134617257862351,528,I think we've reached a tipping point.
112,2,8,20,30,1.4,0.1134617257862351,528,"Alright, second my motion, or I let the table go."
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,I would like to address the rumors of instability in this company.
112,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,528,"Seriously, is there an elephant in the room?"
112,4,4,22,30,1.4,0.13217891045025335,528,"First of all, I would like to welcome you to Sisyphus Corporation."
137,4,3,21,28,1.3928571428571428,0.13934166560380506,528,All I'm asking is for you to look at it from my angle.
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,I appear to be the only one that understands the gravity of this situation.
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,I didn't literally mean heads need to roll.
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,Welcome to the Ayn Rand Institute!
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,"My previous coworkers entertained a very different definition of ""contagious"""
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,I'd appreciate it if you would just level with me.
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,"All right, OK... I'll level with you."
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,Don't everyone volunteer at once.
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,Let me welcome you to Form Over Function Architects LLC.
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,". . .and for most of you, the road to success will be an uphill battle."
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,To get to this position was an uphill battle.
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,I move to table the question and let it slide.
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,Only now may we fully appreciate the gravity of our situation.
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,"All those in favor of removing the wheels from their chair, say aye."
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,Alright. Who moved the white board?
137,4,3,21,28,1.3928571428571428,0.13934166560380506,528,Now it will be easier to talk down to you
137,4,3,21,28,1.3928571428571428,0.13934166560380506,528,So it’s unanimous: The wheels are coming off the chairs.
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,This conversation seems a little one-sided.
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,In order to keep this company on an even keel I'm going to have to throw some of you overboard.
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,I promise to keep this meeting brief since we're short on time and the ship is about to go down...
137,5,1,22,28,1.3928571428571428,0.14853148628740398,528,Show of hands: fix the foundation or remove the wheels from the chairs.
137,1,9,18,28,1.3928571428571428,0.10714285714285715,528,I see you're all inclined to disagree.
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,Didn't anyone think that hiring my brother-in-law to build this building was a bad idea?
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,"First, let me address the rumors that the company is foundering."
137,2,7,19,28,1.3928571428571428,0.11884904072914237,528,"Before we start, can someone straighten that picture?"
137,4,3,21,28,1.3928571428571428,0.13934166560380506,528,Who can tell me why this painting is tilted?
137,3,5,20,28,1.3928571428571428,0.1295013402546089,528,Did anyone bring a Slinky?
164,4,4,23,31,1.3870967741935485,0.12849349889281425,528,I get the sense that the whole room is leaning towards one decision.
164,3,6,22,31,1.3870967741935485,0.11983339110326909,528,It's obvious this company is in a steep decline.
164,0,12,19,31,1.3870967741935485,0.08892934678767883,528,Will someone please straighten the picture?
164,3,6,22,31,1.3870967741935485,0.11983339110326909,528,"The first item on our ""new employee orientation"" agenda is this little exercise in orientation."
164,4,4,23,31,1.3870967741935485,0.12849349889281425,528,I can see which way the room is leaning on this one.
164,3,6,22,31,1.3870967741935485,0.11983339110326909,528,New business: I propose we get rid of these wheely chairs.
164,4,4,23,31,1.3870967741935485,0.12849349889281425,528,"I never talk down to people, if I can help it. I can't help it."
164,4,4,23,31,1.3870967741935485,0.12849349889281425,528,Some of you may be wondering if the Board is properly balanced.
164,4,4,23,31,1.3870967741935485,0.12849349889281425,528,I'm inclined to agree.
164,3,6,22,31,1.3870967741935485,0.11983339110326909,528,Raise your hand if you think Frank Gehry is overrated.
164,4,4,23,31,1.3870967741935485,0.12849349889281425,528,I think we can all appreciate the gravity of the situation.
175,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,528,What do you mean I let you down?
175,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,528,I need to keep my distance as I read the will.
175,4,2,20,26,1.3846153846153846,0.1475640468711606,528,Level playing fields are for losers.
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,Hopefully you all now see the gravity of the situation.
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,"Ok, so moving offshore does have some drawbacks."
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,I see my opinion doesn't carry much weight.
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,I'm inclined to feel the same as all of you.
178,1,9,19,29,1.3793103448275863,0.10426606151978685,528,I thought it would be helpful for our structural engineers to meet at the project.
178,4,3,22,29,1.3793103448275863,0.13513169186547,528,"In hindsight, the three-bean chili for lunch wasn't the best idea."
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,Perhaps we shouldn't have opened an office in Pisa.
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,"Alright then, you balance the budget."
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,Looks like the nays have it.
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,I can see you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,I can clearly see the gravity of the situation.
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,"In the future, a simple ""nay"" would be sufficient."
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,Level floors? Level floors are for closers.
178,5,1,23,29,1.3793103448275863,0.14395703641578778,528,"I said ""Eureka"" not ""I've got Zika""."
178,4,3,22,29,1.3793103448275863,0.13513169186547,528,All I said was Trump is not that bad.
178,4,3,22,29,1.3793103448275863,0.13513169186547,528,"Welcome, National Council on Astigmatism."
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,I'm glad you all appreciate the gravity of this situation.
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,"Okay, so marbles are out. Any other thoughts?"
178,4,3,22,29,1.3793103448275863,0.13513169186547,528,I presume you now understand the gravity of the situation.
178,1,9,19,29,1.3793103448275863,0.10426606151978685,528,So now that you appreciate the gravity of our situation...
178,3,5,21,29,1.3793103448275863,0.12568818544012883,528,I just don't think you understand the gravity of the situation!
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,Tell me why I shouldn't just let go of this table.
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,I never promised you a level playing field
178,2,7,20,29,1.3793103448275863,0.11547495733725166,528,I'm concerned that getting everyone to the table might be an uphill battle.
178,1,9,19,29,1.3793103448275863,0.10426606151978685,528,"We must right this ship, people..."
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,"So, who wants to level the playing field?"
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,It has come to my attention that adaptive reuse of an old fun house may not have been the best option for our office relocation.
203,4,2,21,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1427063223517743,528,"As you know, the company appears to be headed downhill."
203,1,8,18,27,1.3703703703703705,0.10871102010449524,528,I'm inclined to let it slide.
203,3,4,20,27,1.3703703703703705,0.13234837207221578,528,"This board decision may tilt in your favor, but as chair I may still decide to crush you with this table."
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,I think we know which way the Board is leaning...
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,Did I promise you a level playing field?
203,1,8,18,27,1.3703703703703705,0.10871102010449524,528,Before we begin I would like to get something straight.
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,"Yes, we pay on a sliding scale."
203,4,2,21,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1427063223517743,528,"All those in favor of keeping the roller chairs, vote aye"
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,All those in favor of adding brakes to our chairs...
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,I've decided that we need to view this business from a new perspective.
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,Now do you see the gravity of the situation?
203,4,2,21,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1427063223517743,528,Any suggestions on how to level the playing field?
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,Our world has shifted and we must respond.
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,"Like the job description said, we're looking for a candidate who is upwardly mobile."
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,I hope you appreciate the gravity of our situation.
203,4,2,21,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1427063223517743,528,I don't think you all fully appreciate the gravity of our situation...
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,I expect you all to work at full-tilt.
203,4,2,21,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1427063223517743,528,I'm sure you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
203,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,528,Are you with me so far?
203,3,4,20,27,1.3703703703703705,0.13234837207221578,528,Let's all thank Bill for scheduling our meeting on a cruise ship
203,1,8,18,27,1.3703703703703705,0.10871102010449524,528,Meeting adjourned for an hour. Captain wants us on deck.
226,2,7,21,30,1.3666666666666667,0.11227361214762056,528,There's ME. Then nobody. Then you.
226,3,5,22,30,1.3666666666666667,0.12208281844464017,528,This meeting of the Fun House Society is hereby called to order.
226,3,5,22,30,1.3666666666666667,0.12208281844464017,528,I told you not to straighten the picture frame!
226,2,7,21,30,1.3666666666666667,0.11227361214762056,528,I feel like this conversation is one-sided.
230,1,7,17,25,1.36,0.11372481406154653,528,"In fact, I'm sure it was the onions."
230,3,3,19,25,1.36,0.13999999999999999,528,"Yup, Fred Astaire used the same room."
230,2,5,18,25,1.36,0.12754084313139324,528,Those in favor of chairs without rollers raise your hand.
230,2,5,18,25,1.36,0.12754084313139324,528,I'm going to level with you people...
230,2,5,18,25,1.36,0.12754084313139324,528,I feel your plane.
230,3,3,19,25,1.36,0.13999999999999999,528,Welcome to the Trump School of Interior Architecture.

236,0,10,18,28,1.3571428571428572,0.0922138891954147,528,I hope you all understand the gravity of this situation.
236,2,6,20,28,1.3571428571428572,0.11744959195991066,528,I'm afraid we're going to have to make some structural changes.
236,1,8,19,28,1.3571428571428572,0.1055883706003974,528,I know it looks like an uphill battle but...
236,3,4,21,28,1.3571428571428572,0.12821820969367867,528,"When they said ""restructuring,"" I didn't think they meant the building."
236,1,8,19,28,1.3571428571428572,0.1055883706003974,528,You need to understand the gravity of our situation.

236,3,4,21,28,1.3571428571428572,0.12821820969367867,528,"I'll count to 3, and then I let go of the table."

236,4,2,22,28,1.3571428571428572,0.13814996178991437,528,You've made it obvious which way the board is leaning.
236,2,6,20,28,1.3571428571428572,0.11744959195991066,528,"The good news is, I was able to get you moved out of your cubicles..."
236,2,6,20,28,1.3571428571428572,0.11744959195991066,528,"And that my friends, is how babies are made..."

236,1,8,19,28,1.3571428571428572,0.1055883706003974,528,"First, let's go over the difference between port and starboard."
253,1,7,18,26,1.3461538461538463,0.11013708510212582,528,I am inclined to disagree with the rest of you.
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,I still think it would've been easier to just re-hang the wall art.

253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,I win.
253,4,1,21,26,1.3461538461538463,0.14615384615384616,528,Good! Now don't move as I crush you with this table.

253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,So it seems that I'm Scotland on this one.
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,Why have we stopped serving coffee at our meetings?

253,4,1,21,26,1.3461538461538463,0.14615384615384616,528,I think now would be a good time to show our recent sales graph!
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,"Okay, that takes care of the demotions."
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,Where's the elephant in the room when you need one?
253,0,9,17,26,1.3461538461538463,0.09514859136040757,528,I see the paradigm has shifted.
253,1,7,18,26,1.3461538461538463,0.11013708510212582,528,"So, you're leaning towards a consensus."
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,I need to level with you...
253,1,7,18,26,1.3461538461538463,0.11013708510212582,528,"Someone, please straighten out the white board."
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,The weight of the evidence is certainly on your side
253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,"Ok, from now on you'll have to work to get a seat at the table."
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,I'm sorry. The board has asked us to be more transparent with our salary disparity.

253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,This meeting is an uphill battle.

253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,Didn't anyone think to ask if the cartoonist could handle perspective?
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,I vote that this is our last meeting at the Museum of Modern Art.
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,"Those who think we need to be merged and acquired, crawl toward me."
253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,Thank you for participating in the architectural firm's first-ever focus group.
253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,That's what happens when you let go of the table.
253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,I still say the cartoonist just signed this crooked.
253,4,1,21,26,1.3461538461538463,0.14615384615384616,528,Get back to the table and fix the crooked video screen.

253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,I want you all to be aware of the gravity of our situation.
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,Seriously...who's with me?
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,Excellent slide show.
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,"If revenue is down next month, expect the table to have wheels too."
253,1,7,18,26,1.3461538461538463,0.11013708510212582,528,I see that it's going to be an uphill battle to get you on my side.

253,1,7,18,26,1.3461538461538463,0.11013708510212582,528,Welcome aboard.
253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,Let's table that motion until the pendulum swings back.
253,1,7,18,26,1.3461538461538463,0.11013708510212582,528,"Don't think of it as me speaking down to you, look at it as you looking up to me."
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,"A simple ""nay"" would have sufficed."
253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,We knew the relocation to Pisa would present challenges.
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,It's just a cold sore
253,2,5,19,26,1.3461538461538463,0.12331707339908768,528,The balance of power has shifted.
253,3,3,20,26,1.3461538461538463,0.13521842947113036,528,You're looking at it from the downside.
253,0,9,17,26,1.3461538461538463,0.09514859136040757,528,I don't recommend soup for lunch.
253,4,1,21,26,1.3461538461538463,0.14615384615384616,528,"It's over, gentlemen. I have the high ground."
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,"Unfortunately, our architect was working on a sliding scale."
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,"If you want a seat at the table, you're going to have to Lean In"
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,"All in favor of not renewing the lease say ""I""."
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,Who said anything about an even playing field?
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,"No, I don't think my opinion is slanted."
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,It appears the board is not leaning in my favor.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,Our critics say the party leans too far to the right.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,I'm sure you're all wondering why I've gathered you there today.
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,"Two reasons really: one, because I am a germ phobe and two, because your silly opinions mean nothing to me."
306,2,4,18,24,1.3333333333333333,0.13003158293424902,528,I am still not inclined to take your proposal
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,"Planning and preparedness. See, I had the foresight to lock my wheels in case of a sudden shift in perspective."
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,I thought having today's staff meeting on my yacht would be a good idea . . . But apparently not.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,Now that you understand the gravity of the situation . . .
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,I’ve been letting some things slide recently.
306,1,8,21,30,1.3333333333333333,0.09980824526939037,528,"In San Francisco, we like to proceed as if nothing's happened."
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,"First off, we never promised you level playing field."
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,This business is quite literally in decline.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,Our research indicates that fracking has absolutely no adverse effect on the environment.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,So that's how we roll
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,Thank you for coming. I hope you're all comfortable. Can everyone see the screen?
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,I don't think I can hold this table any longer
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,Not only is the rent cheaper but the building has great drainage
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,I don't think you grasp the gravity of this situation.
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,So we agree. This architectural firm is dissolved.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,I'd like to give you a different slant on the problem
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,I doubt we will ever see eye-to-eye.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,We have got to get rid of these wheels
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,I'm leaning that direction too.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,Did I hear a motion?
306,1,8,21,30,1.3333333333333333,0.09980824526939037,528,This is exactly what I meant when I said we have to level the field.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,"I know, but the architect just won an award."
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,I must level with you about this.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,Thank you all for meeting me in Pisa.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,"OK, who's against me?"
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,I want to level with you.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,This is a matter of some gravity.
306,2,4,18,24,1.3333333333333333,0.13003158293424902,528,"Come on people, it's an optical illusion."
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,The property manager said they could straighten up the building but then the window would be crooked.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,"Before we begin, can someone straighten the picture please?"
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,Good thing the table is not on wheels.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,I hope this helps you understand the gravity of the situation
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,Any suggestions for addressing the silly rumor that the economy is tilted in favor of us one-percenters?
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,Let's roll.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,All in favor of NOT having the next retreat on a cruise ship...
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,"Ok, I promise, I'll never reference "" the Donald"" again"
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,Believe me when I tell you that your opinion matters just as much as mine.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,"Of course, Trump U is on the level. Why do you ask?"
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,What will it take to bring everyone back to the table again?
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,I should've had a V8.
306,1,6,17,24,1.3333333333333333,0.11526067913468745,528,I told you the level playing field was a myth!
306,2,4,18,24,1.3333333333333333,0.13003158293424902,528,"As no other issues have been brought to the table, the meeting is adjourned."
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,The architect did mention that there was a minor glitch in the plans...
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,I think that picture might be crooked.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,Let me try to straighten this all out
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,I had this room built to make a point.
306,3,3,21,27,1.3333333333333333,0.1307440900921227,528,I'm sorry but the lifeboats only have room for the CEO's.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,You have to consider the gravity of the situation.
306,1,7,19,27,1.3333333333333333,0.10675210253672476,528,We can't continue to let things slide.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,I see you have the majority in your corner.
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,First on the agenda is Rex who found us this great deal on a conference room!
306,2,5,20,27,1.3333333333333333,0.11935247900657214,528,"Do you wish to table that motion, or let it slide?"
367,2,5,21,28,1.3214285714285714,0.11562541495502748,528,We may have made a mistake in putting our offices in this cruise ship.
367,3,3,22,28,1.3214285714285714,0.12654935491350772,528,I wanted to make sure we started with your backs against the wall
367,3,3,22,28,1.3214285714285714,0.12654935491350772,528,I still think Trump will make a great president.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,I feel the weight of the board is against me.
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,Could you all just lean in?
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Now I see the gravity of our situation.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,We have to stop having these meetings on the ferry.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,As I told you our business ethics are on a very slippery slope!
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Just be glad the table isn't on wheels.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,How are the clinical trials on the new vertigo med going?
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,"By now, the gravity of your situation should be obvious."
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,And we saved nearly 20% having the construction done by Bob's brother in-law.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Who thought it was a good idea to have the Board meeting on a cruise ship?
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I cannot stress enough the gravity of the situation.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,You wanna work remotely? You got it!
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"Cheerio, EU!"
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,"Granted, your argument carries weight."
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,A guy who had something to do with that Fred Astaire movie is coming in to help.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"Well, I guess I know which way we're leaning."
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I appreciate how heavy this matter has been weighing on you.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,Our campaign has shifted to the far right.
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,I can see you all understand the gravity of the situation.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,There will be a reduction in middle management.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,"Ok, I'll admit it: Headquartering the company on international waters wasn't worth the tax breaks."
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,I've got a different slant on the issue.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,If our downhill slide continues we will soon be upside down.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,This Board must recognize its position relative to the Chairman.
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,Welcome to California.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Next time don't put the floor plans in cursive.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,"Trust me, you'll see it differently when we list to port."
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,"Clearly, I’ve let you down."
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Only those seated at the table are eligible to vote.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Clearly I don't favor a level playing field.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Let me be blunt. This company is going downhill.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I hope you all appreciate the gravity of this situation.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,"The room is straight, the picture is crooked"
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"Is it just me, or have we lost our perspective, people?"
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,Leaving this meeting will be an uphill battle.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Everybody with me so far?
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,"Oh, sure, you all SAY you want a seat at the table . . ."
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I have good news and bad news about our artificial gravity project.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Our industry seems to have reached its tipping point.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,Will somebody straighten the damn picture.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Let me level with you.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Never hire an architect from Pisa.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,You actually have to ask why no coffee and donuts today!
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,It's my breath isn't it?
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,You think my opinions are skewed?
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,I'd like for everyone to come up with one idea for improving these meetings.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Now you can't deny that things are looking up.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Anyone have a breath mint?
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,I am getting the feeling you are not with me on this!
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,"I said raise your hand, not hands"
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"So, I guess the rest of the board is leaning in a different direction."
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,"Mr. Cameron, we're just a bit confused about what the plot of the sequel would be."
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"All those in favor, say ""Aye, aye!"""
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I got a raise.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I called this meeting to discuss certain downward trends.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"""Level playing fields"" are overrated."
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"If I hear level playing field once more, I will not be amused."
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,The weight of opinion seems to be against me.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Now that we have established a level playing field...
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,So that's 7-1 in favor of me showering.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I get it. Your work-life balance is off.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,I think we're on the edge of something really big.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,No even one of you has anything to bring to the table?
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Ok. So maybe we do need to deal with that sink hole in the parking lot.
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Some of you will think the floor here is not level; some of you will think it is. But what's important is that we respect each others opinion.
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Welcome to your first Weight Watchers meeting!
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"I can't make it any clearer, profits are down."
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Did you expect a level playing field?
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,I'm sensing a bias in the room.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,All those opposed?
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"A simple ""nay"" will do next time, folks."
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,I'm inclined to think you disagree.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,Seven architects and not one of you noticed the window was crooked?
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,"As you may have noticed, our company has gone downhill."
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Isn’t anybody going to say gesundheit?
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,"All in favor of stationary chairs, raise your hands."
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,Perhaps you can now understand how it feels to be a share of our stock.
370,0,8,17,25,1.32,0.09521904571390465,528,I'm sure you agree that we need to keep this company on an even keel.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,"Well, as you can see, the company is going down hill."
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,"Welcome to Sisyphus, Inc. Please gather around the table."
370,1,6,18,25,1.32,0.11135528725660042,528,"Nonsense. If the boat were sinking, I would have been airlifted out by now."
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,All those who do not think this is a level playing field raise their hands!
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,You've all heard of the Tipping Point...
370,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,528,Try to level with me.
370,3,2,20,25,1.32,0.1380821011813865,528,Could someone please straighten the whiteboard?
455,2,5,22,29,1.3103448275862069,0.11211632193833537,528,"All in favor of closing the Pisa office say, ""Aye!"""
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,Our sales department has really gone downhill.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"I'm sorry, but now that the bank has placed a lean on the building, I have no choice but to let all of you go."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"'' After Ms. Davenport's presentation, we're having sliders for lunch.''"
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,There's a motion that we become a standing committee.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,You will be evaluated on a sliding scale
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Maybe we should stop thinking outside the box
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"I can have the wheels removed from your chairs, but that's all!"
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"Someone is underperforming, and that's the elephant in the room we need to talk about."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I am strongly reconsidering our ability to be fair and balanced.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"As your CEO, I know you look up to me for a new slant on how to address our decline in business."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I can't hold the table much longer...
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,Anyone doubt that I'm not on the level?
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,Don’t let the gravity of the situation impact your board vote.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"In hindsight, we should have re-framed the window instead."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,As you know there has been a shift in the market.
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,Stop putting a slant on everything I say.
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,I take that as disapproval of the proposed sliding pay scale.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I don't think you guys are being straight with me
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"...also on the agenda, we will be asking the City of Pisa to renew our lease."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,I'm slowly coming around to the idea that the business is reaching a tipping point.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I called this meeting today because I felt I should just level with you.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,These shipboard meetings seem to be driving us apart.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"Practical, no. Demoralizing, yes."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,We should approach this from a different angle.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,Our motto here is to be fair and balanced!
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Why do I feel like the only one to grasp the levity of the situation?
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Looks like I remain as Chairman in a landslide.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,The first meeting of the housing committee of Pisa is adjourned.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,I don't see how a Feng Shui consultant can help us.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,My plan is to level the playing field.
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,Your probably wondering why I've cornered you all here today.
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,I hope you appreciate the gravity of this situation.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I'm afraid the market slide was more far-reaching than we anticipated.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,What leads you to believe we aren't using a level playing field?
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Your performance was based on a sliding scale
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Would one of you straighten the whiteboard?
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,It seems we've reached the tipping point.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,I realize this firm has been going downhill for a while...
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,The gravity of all this is pretty obvious.
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,"Fox News, fair and balanced."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,Do I detect a tilt to the right?
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,It pays to get to meetings early
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,We need a different angle.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"The first item on the agenda is proposed new acquisitions for the Guggenheim,"
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,haha does anyone know where we got those brownies?
456,0,8,18,26,1.3076923076923077,0.09230769230769233,528,Our architect studied in Pisa.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"Well, it looks like we've reached the tipping point."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I was hired to bring balance to the company.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"My, how the tables have turned."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I am inclined to tell you some bad news.
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,"I meant ""we need a heavy weight on the board"" figuratively."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,And we save 10% of our health insurance costs by making the walk to the copy machine uphill.
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,....OK the ayes have it. All future meetings will moved to Florence.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,This board seems to be going downhill.
456,0,8,18,26,1.3076923076923077,0.09230769230769233,528,Now that I have your attention...
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,"Of course there are drawbacks, but this is the most affordable office space in all of Pisa."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Agreed. Next year's conference will move from Pisa to the Tower of London.
456,0,8,18,26,1.3076923076923077,0.09230769230769233,528,I don't mean to talk down to you...
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I think you’ll find our earnings chart looks more profitable from that angle.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"OK, here's how we're going to sidestep a recall of our levels and plumb bobs."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"As you may have guessed, our stock is down."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"I know it doesn't look so great now, but I think our cruise line investments eventually will pay off."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"Yes, you're right, this company is facing an uphill battle."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,Welcome to trickle down Econ 101.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"If you could all just lean in. Especially you, Susan."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I feel certain I could bring a new perspective to your company.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Does that window look askew to anyone?
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,Dad build this company with his bare hands. He was a terrible carpenter.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,Th markets have shifted.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I'm sensing a bias...
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I've got to level with you.
456,0,8,18,26,1.3076923076923077,0.09230769230769233,528,Now try to table my motion!
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,"""Someone has to take the higher ground""."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,Level with me.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,"I like the angle your taking with this one, guys."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,I don't want you to think of me as your boss.
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,I want the architecture committee in my office. RIGHT NOW!
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,"PLEASE, call me Eileen."
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,"All those in favor of removing their wheels, say ""Aye""."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"I don't know how, but I'm trying to level with you."
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"From now on, it's all uphill."
456,2,4,20,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1211385826771048,528,These meetings always seem to go downhill.
456,1,6,19,26,1.3076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,528,"You do realize that it's the window that's tilted, don't you?"
456,3,2,21,26,1.3076923076923077,0.13323467750529827,528,"Well now... the tables seemed to have turned a bit, haven't they?"
540,1,5,17,23,1.3043478260869565,0.11651701954927807,528,"I know it seems like we are far apart on this, but that's just an illusion."
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,I want to impress upon you the gravity of our situation.
541,0,7,17,24,1.2916666666666667,0.09477598811252415,528,We've taken some extraordinary measures to level that picture frame.
541,2,3,19,24,1.2916666666666667,0.12739256153441425,528,I see you all grasp the gravity of the situation.
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,Catch!
541,3,1,20,24,1.2916666666666667,0.14089731416920842,528,"Ok then, it's agreed. We'll move our offices from Park Slope to Flatbush."
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,I am restoring top-down management.
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,I sense the board is already leaning one way on this issue.
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,"...well, that's my opinion. Which way are you guys leaning?"
541,2,3,19,24,1.2916666666666667,0.12739256153441425,528,Good Job People! It's all down hill from here!
541,2,3,19,24,1.2916666666666667,0.12739256153441425,528,All those in favor of leaving the building now...
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,Why am I the only one to bring anything to the table?
541,0,7,17,24,1.2916666666666667,0.09477598811252415,528,Perhaps we should look at this from another angle.
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,"So, I think it's fair to say that we've reached our tipping point."
541,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,528,"Now that you're all together, let's begin."
541,2,3,19,24,1.2916666666666667,0.12739256153441425,528,"However, there is one downside to this new plan..."
541,2,3,19,24,1.2916666666666667,0.12739256153441425,528,'Someone's' got to organize the Christmas party.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Let's approach this issue from a new angle.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Fair enough. But you can't beat the rent on this place!
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,For some unknown reason the 'The American Association of Homebuilders' is investigating our construction company.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,The garlic naan and lamb curry were totally worth it.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,What do you mean 'level playing field?'
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I suggest we adjourn before we hit the next wave
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,It's not too late to change your vote.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Can we get some interns to starboard for ballast?
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I’m going to level with you.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,We need to talk about today's orientation.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I didn't say Simon says.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,You guys should probably move...I can only hold this table for so much longer.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"And finally, the company's new weight-loss initiative begins on Monday..."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,You all seriously need to lean-in.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,The figures for the second quarter are titanic.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I just want to quash the rumors that this company is a sinking ship.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Will someone please throw me back my pen?
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"Now that we have established the appropriate balance of power, we may commence our meeting."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Who seconds the motion for wheelless chairs?
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,"Tell you what, I'm willing to meet you half-way"
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,So what you're saying is our engineering issues are also a metaphor for something?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"Before we get down to business, Where are we with finding a new architect?"
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"Yes, I’m the architect. What seems to be the problem?"
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"Okay, this meeting is going downhill fast"
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Admit it. You've let things slide.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I'd call this a landslide.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,I'm aware that this focus group skews to the right.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"Simon says, roll back to the table."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Try to see it from my perspective: I'm not looking down on you. You're looking up to me!
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I know you all probably feel like you're on a slippery slope here.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is why in California we bolt the tables to the floors."
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,please set your wheels to the lock position
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"I want to assure all of you,I intend to manage with a level playing field."
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,Corporately we believe all crap rolls down hill.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I wouldn't call it push back.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I've lost control of the room.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,I wish you would level with me.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"Just because I'm the boss' son, don't think that things are tilted in my favor."
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Building Maintenance says they've fixed the whiteboards.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Perhaps... but the rest of the news networks are all slanted the other way.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Did the earth move for you too?
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Cheapest office space in all of Pisa. and this board room is huge!
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,It's just an illusion.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,We're fair and balanced regardless of what you see
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,And that's why a chair needs five legs.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Well I'm glad to see that at least you all can appreciate the gravity of our situation.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I'm still not changing our name! We worked hard branding San Andreas.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,So somebody tell me why you all think we've tilted too far to the right.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I know some of you are wondering how you got on the list.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"In hindsight, we should have just re-framed the window."
557,3,1,21,25,1.28,0.13564659966250536,528,Did anyone think to turn on the projector before they sat down?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,I wanted to give you a different slant on things
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,....I know things have been going down hill lately....
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"In conclusion, let me assure the board that this business is in no way a sinking ship."
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I think you all understand the gravity of the situation.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,C'mon guys. Do we have to do this every time I need a volunteer?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Welcome to Escher Industries.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,So much for your office coup.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,One false move and I'll let go of the table
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,Today's study group seems a bit one-sided.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Thank God for walls.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"On the other hand,upper management will be fine."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Look at this from my angle.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"The optics may appear to be somewhat slanted, but management does not believe that the company is sinking."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"We're on a roll, people!"
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,There's been a shift in our corporate structure.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I don't think you people are on the level with me.
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,Today we will be discussing a new floor plan.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Now that you understand the gravity of this situation...
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,It took an earthquake to prove that the self-leveling picture frame works!
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Is the white board crooked?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"I'm known as a mover and a shaker, but my specialty is tilter."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,You're probably wondering why I called you all there.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"Look, I know a lot of you aren't thrilled by the sudden transfer from London to our office in Pisa."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"Ha! Let's see you lean in now, Carol."
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,The risks may be shifting to the downside.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Welcome to the construction oversight committee.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"Alright, then, if there are no objections to the seating arrangements we'll move on to the menu."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"In hindsight, we should not have invested in the chairs with wheels."
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I beg your pardon; your comments were a bit off-centered.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Crikey! I forgot the balance sheets!
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,And salaries will obviously be on a sliding scale.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I take it the board has changed its position
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I think we should look at this new project from a different angle.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I'm told that you have a bunch of new ideas.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Did anybody else feel that?
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,You may have noticed a shift in management recently.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,I thought it would be lonelier up here.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,How dare you accuse me of not leveling with you!
557,3,1,21,25,1.28,0.13564659966250536,528,Our first order of business is to discuss the gopher problem.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,It's not just about getting to the top; it's about staying at the top.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Seating by pay scale.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"Oh, how the table has turned."
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Nobody leaves until we straighten this out.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"Next meeting, we'll try a different slant."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Just be thankful we don't work in the warehouse.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I'll concede your unanimous vote on this issue carries a lot of weight.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"When I said we had to get lean, I didn't mean this."
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Carl began to doubt his choice of the Titanic for the annual company leadership retreat.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"Look, team, Brexit has been rough on everyone. But let's just try and make the best of our relocation to Pisa."
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,"I see the weight of your arguments, but I still feel I have the upper hand..."
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Does that painting look crooked to you?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,I was really hoping for your support on this.
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,One of the many reasons I nail my feet to the floor.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Now---which one of you is the architect?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,You all have equal rights. In this company we take pride in offering a level playing field.
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,Try to see this from my angle...
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,So you're the committee that selected the architect for the new headquarters.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"First off I'd like to acknowledge that, yes, the company relocation to Pisa has been difficult for all of us."
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,We've implemented something new to improve attentiveness at meetings.
557,3,1,21,25,1.28,0.13564659966250536,528,Anyone up for beer pong?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,That's it! No more cruise line retreats.
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,Next item on the agenda: using the restrooms.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,You catch my drift?
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Welcome to our first corporate retreat at sea. Any questions?
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,But does the Marketing Data say the ship is sinking?
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Your salaries from now on will also be on a sliding scale.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh Choo!
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,We need to address the elephant in the room upstairs.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I don't suppose that someone could get me a cup of coffee.
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,I'm glad you see the gravity of this situation.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,I'm sensing a subtle power shift within the group.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Try looking at it from my point of view
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,We're restructuring so you're going to have to roll with it.
557,3,1,21,25,1.28,0.13564659966250536,528,Looks like the balance of power has taken an interesting turn.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Just think of this as a zero sum game.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Sorry about that. I had chili for lunch.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,Can I presume you are all Republicans?
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,At least they hung the window properly
557,1,5,19,25,1.28,0.1083205120618128,528,Our structural engineering business is for sale.
557,2,3,20,25,1.28,0.12274635093014645,528,"Good, you're all on the same side of the table."
557,0,7,18,25,1.28,0.09165151389911678,528,The architect graciously offered to work on a sliding scale.
689,2,2,18,22,1.2727272727272727,0.13454779452744636,528,WHAT flows downhill?
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,"People, the ship is sinking...."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,So it's unamimous. The Titanic Directorship votes for Trump.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,We are here to debate whether fracking is or is not a problem. Is there a motion from the floor?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,In this company you have to climb the table.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Let's be careful how we spin this.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Your uncle Louis was not the great architect you thought he was.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Again, any rumors suggesting a downward slide with the company's performance are unfounded."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I favor the motion.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Red Rover, Red Rover, send Braxton from accounting on over."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Yes, Brexit has had unintended consequences."
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,"For obvious reasons, the company will no longer be providing free lunches."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Of course what you have to say matters.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,The vote is unanimous to purchase a new plumb bob.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I see that a different perspective doesn't change anything.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Before we begin, would someone please straighten the whiteboard? It's hanging crooked."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Why do you always have to be so obtuse?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,What a great game of air hockey! Who's up for some ping pong?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,we need to level with each other...
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Let's all just take a step back for a moment
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I want to know which one of you contracted out the building renovations and I want to know now.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Okay, me next--ready?"
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,First order of business; let's fix that window.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,All rise.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Did anyone else feel that quake?
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,This chair will oppose any unanimous descent until the table is motioned!
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"As I've always told you, it's lonely at the top."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Dave, would you please straighten out the easel board?"
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,We need to work on levelling the playing field.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Can somebody straighten that picture frame?
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,You realize the italics in the meeting agenda are intended for emphasis only.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Congratulations to all for this landslide victory.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,This board carries too much weight.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I always knew our board of directors carried a lot of weight.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Of course your argument has weight.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"""We share this floor with ""Weight Watchers""."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I told you the last time we needed a different perspective.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I see you're leaning toward a consensus.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"The good news is, sales are flat."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,If you want to get onto my management table you're gonna have to push yourselves real hard
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Okay, I'm gonna let go now. Watch me. Watch me, guys. It's gonna be awesome. Brad you aren't looking."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Being at the head of the table has it's advantages.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,"We've got to get the company back on an even keel, guys."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I understand your position. But that's just not the way I roll.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I hope you understand the gravity of this meeting.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,What's say we let this motion slide?
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I like the way you all look up to me.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,There's been a seismic shift in our management.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"So, whose idea was this feng shui thing?"
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,It's called 'disruptive architecture'.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,"Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that the rumors about the building's structural instability are completely false."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Whoa.....I think your opinions weigh a lot more than mine!
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Except for the occasional earthquake, I think you will enjoy living here in California."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,The quick fix would be to remove the casters from each chair.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,How many of you know how to swim?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Would you say this company treats men and women the same?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Gentlemen, I'm not sure you understand the gravity of our situation."
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,Let's not make this all about me
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,And no more nonsense about a lack of a level playing field !
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"If I don't have an answer in 30 seconds, I let go of the table."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I thought we might gain some new perspectives this way.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I am tired of hearing people say the company's going downhill.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Well! Looks like I get to be chairman.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I do hope you all understand the gravity of the situation!
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,This meeting is going down hill fast.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Does anyone else want a Dramamine?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Please understand, it is only through mere architectural idiosyncrasy that I'm talking down to you."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"As new employees, your first task is to pull up a chair."
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,I reject your slippery slope argument.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Which one of you had the idea to meet on a cruise ship?
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,I sense a definite shift in attitude around here
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"I said..., this discussion appears a bit lopsided."
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,When I said we need to rollback I meant prices!
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,We're here to get a report on the progress in the suit against the architects.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I want everyone to try to come to the table on this.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I truly believe your point of view is skewed.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I don't think you understand the gravity of this decision
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"So you heard, I just got back from Rio!"
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,There is a motion to adjourn until after the earthquake. Any second?
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Look, I stand by my Engineer. He says it's good, it's good."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Before we start ... Barclay can you straighten the mirror?
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,"Remember people, a rising tide doesn't lift all boats."
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,"With a little time, I'm confident you'll all come my way."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,We are not going to let this slide.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"And next, the bonuses for the Building Committee."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I believe we need to fire the architect.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,First order of business: let's change these castor-wheels with some sticky rubber feet. Second order of business: let's fire our architects.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,It's called trickle-down ergonomics.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,...and that is why I think I'd be a great fit at the Acme Seesaw Company.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I seem to be the only that understands the gravity of the situation.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,"For tax purposes, we're relocating our offices to Pisa, Italy. This should help you all adjust."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Let's get this straight, balancing the budget is just part of the problem...."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,The first one to roll up here gets a promotion!
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,You don't appreciate the gravity of the situation.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I wanted to inform you that the structural engineers have discovered a slight problem.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,I understand the gravity of the situation.
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,"As your new superior, it is necessary that you start looking up to me."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"You are not being fair, nor balanced."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I promise I'll stop ordering liver and onions during lunch meetings.
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,Vote with me or I let go of the table !
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,"At the count of three, everyone run to the other side of the room."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I'll make this candid and short. Our company is a sinking ship.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Is it the room or my breath?
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Despite all our efforts to level the playing field, we've decided to go the other way."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Not just our stock is sliding
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,You got the drift?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Our customers must be convinced that we're on the level.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,"Did you say something about a slippery slope, Evelyn?"
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,This more accurately represents the corporate balance of power.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,"It's demigod, not demagogue!"
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I'm afraid I misunderstood when you said we need a new slant on the way we do our staff meetings.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,We believe it's a temporary market shift.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,Once again I regret getting office space in a Frank Gehry building.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"If you feel like victims of bias now, just wait 'til I let go of this table."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"If any of you oppose, I will literally crush you."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,.......nor is the deck stacked against any of you.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I hope you all understand the gravity of our situation.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I am so glad we moved our office to Pisa.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Before I let go of this table, I want you all to know how much I have appreciated working with you."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"No, you can't sit at the conference table, we've eliminated middle management."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Like our profits.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,Why didn't anybody bring anything to the table worth discussing?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"The bad news is the the tide has turned.""... The good news is Surf's Up."
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,The listing did say that relocating to a 'low cost business tower' in Pisa has it's ups and downs
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"I think if the rest of you take the wheels off your chairs, we can resume the meeting."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Not until we figure out who's passing gas!
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"Yes, the rumors are true. We've pivoted."
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,"And when you say 'leaning way too much to the right,' do you mean in the political context?"
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,Stay right there and with a little luck the aftershock will slide you right back to your places.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,First one who makes it to this end of the table gets the corner office.
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,"""Yeah... Well, this is not a playing field!"
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,This new conference room should help us get everyone's slant on things.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Who says that I look down on them?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,"We're facing an uphill battle and unfortunately, some of you may not make it."
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,Whose brilliant idea was it to hold our board meeting on a cruise ship?
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I still think California was a good choice for our headquarters.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,The first item on our agenda is a proposal that we take the wheels off of our chairs.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,First one that catches it gets the promotion
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,This meeting seems to be going downhill.
690,3,1,22,26,1.2692307692307692,0.13076923076923075,528,"From your perspective, things are looking up!"
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,No need to vote then since you are all so inclined.
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,I'm leaning towards agreeing with you
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,I sense a slight shift.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,As if to prove my point that too many on our team have become dead weight...
690,1,5,20,26,1.2692307692307692,0.10462669622104186,528,It's not going to be business as usual anymore.
690,2,3,21,26,1.2692307692307692,0.11842157167954347,528,"Actually, it's the camera and the window that's slanted."
690,0,7,19,26,1.2692307692307692,0.0887120199590061,528,I see the room has shifted.
837,1,4,18,23,1.2608695652173914,0.11276950685918657,528,"All in favor of removing the wheels from the chairs, say “Aye!”"
837,2,2,19,23,1.2608695652173914,0.12911053732064087,528,Let's do a roll call vote instead.
837,1,4,18,23,1.2608695652173914,0.11276950685918657,528,Compensation is based on a sliding scale.
837,2,2,19,23,1.2608695652173914,0.12911053732064087,528,I think your view is slanted. Look at it from my angle.
837,2,2,19,23,1.2608695652173914,0.12911053732064087,528,"Perhaps it comes as no surprise, the company is slipping."
837,1,4,18,23,1.2608695652173914,0.11276950685918657,528,Who put this to a floor vote?
837,1,4,18,23,1.2608695652173914,0.11276950685918657,528,"As you may have noticed, our company is experiencing a downturn."
837,1,4,18,23,1.2608695652173914,0.11276950685918657,528,Today we will discuss the balance of power in our organization.
837,0,6,17,23,1.2608695652173914,0.09361833424764432,528,I was really hoping we could meet in the middle on this one.
837,1,4,18,23,1.2608695652173914,0.11276950685918657,528,I didn't mean this arrangement to imply an imbalance of power.
837,1,4,18,23,1.2608695652173914,0.11276950685918657,528,So it's 7 to 1 in favor of chairs with no wheels.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Pay will be on a sliding scale from now on.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"Remember, the money saved buying swamp land paid your bonuses this year."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Considering the gravity of the situation . . .
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Next on the agenda is how will the company's profitability be influenced by the tilt of the earth's axis.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"On the plus side, today’s meeting space came in under budget."
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,"OK, you all are Europe and I'm Britain."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"No, I'm pretty sure this is more than just a paradigm shift."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"I think, then, we can dispense with the graph."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,None of you seem to be aware of the gravity of this situation.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I suggest that today's focus group is not fairly balanced.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,NOW do you get the gravity of this situation?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Corporate has made it clear which way they are leaning...
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Let's try to do our level best.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,First up on today's agenda: whoever purchased rolly chairs is fired.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Why are we meeting on a boat?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Shall I chair?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I knew this Board was crooked.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I have a vague sense that I may not have the Board's full support on this one.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I hope you realize the gravity of the situation.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"You recognize, it's only by mere geological accident that I'm talking down to you."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"We have a problem, and I know you'd all appreciate some straight talk."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I know it's the picture frame.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,One more weighted opinion and I let go of the table.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"First, let's talk about the purpose of a focus group."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"It was a rough quarter, but we remain long-term focused here at Titanic Enterprises"
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,welcome back
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,It's a good thing that you're all sitting down....
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,HR thinks we might be a bit top heavy.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Boy, that tilted window is driving me nuts!"
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,What makes you think I'm slanting the news?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Holding our board meeting at sea may have not been the best ideal.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Let's face it, your performances are slipping."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I am unmoved by the gravity of consensus.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,It takes bold leadership to admit that the wheeled chairs were a mistake.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I hope you don't box yourselves into a corner during these negotations.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Good news! The breaks for your chairs are on the truck!
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,You may have read about the shift in our corporate culture...
848,3,0,21,24,1.25,0.13791932109184263,528,"The bad news is, an earthquake hit the building and we're all going to die. The good news is, from this angle, next year's marketing projections look great."
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,It's all a matter of perspective.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,All in favor of manning the life boats?
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I think it's about time we got this ship on an even keel.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Harold is rocking the boat - again
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,We've got a new slant on team bonding.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Didn't I specifically say to order the chairs without wheels?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I like talking down to you.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Our landlord contends we must have defective furniture and astigmatism.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Now you shall see the gravity of the situation that our company is in.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,There was just enough room in the budget to straighten the window.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,This is as level as the playing field is ever going to get.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,You all say things are looking up; I have a different point of view!
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Was it something I said?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,It appears that negotiations have shifted in your favor
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Well, I can see you all appreciate the gravity of the situation."
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,So you all think we need to take a different slant?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Self leveling picture frames , that's my pitch."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,You're probably all wondering why I sceduled this meeting in Pisa.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Have I made my position clear enough?
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I'm sure you understand the gravity of the situation.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,"Now, I understand there have been some wild rumors going around about a leveraged buyout."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Who wants a kiss?
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I can't emphasize enough the gravity of our situation.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Does that picture look crooked to you? It's driving me crazy.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I have failed to grasp the gravity of my situation.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,About the motion to replace the rolling chairs…
848,3,0,21,24,1.25,0.13791932109184263,528,Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,The meeting of the Order of Sisyphus will come to order.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,"Jones, have the wheels removed from conference room chairs until we dock. And straighten the bulletin board."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"Just wait till the floor drops, too!"
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,First item of business - the new architectural review committee
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Martha, can you please lean in?"
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"Allow me to rephrase, keep both hands on the table, if not in favor of tomorrow's meeting being held on board."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Could somebody please straighten the picture on the wall again?
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I'm not certain this is the right committee to balance the budget.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,Which one of you tilted the painting?
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,Let the record show that it's 7 to 1 in favor of level floors.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Does anybody have any questions?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I want to hear whateveryone at this table has to say.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,So I perceive the entire room is in opposition!
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I feel like your perspective on this may be slightly skewed.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Obviously, chairs with wheels don't work well with our architectural style."
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,Rigged? What makes you think the system is rigged?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,...And now I wish to speak to you about a matter of some gravity...
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"OK, maybe Pisa wasn't the best place to build our office."
848,0,4,12,16,1.25,0.11180339887498948,528,"""Now the room's feng shui is perfect""."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Someone's rocking the boat!
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Even though I'm now part of management, I want us to continue to be a team."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I see you're all tilting one way on this matter.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"You may be wondering why our architecture and design firm is closing, effective immediately . . ."
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I think we know which way we're leaning. Let's vote on it.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I can officially confirm what you already know; we're going under.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I'm sensing some resistance to my proposal.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I sense that you all have shifted your position on this matter.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Does that picture look crooked to you?
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Leaning in is so last year.
848,3,0,21,24,1.25,0.13791932109184263,528,Of course management values your opinions.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,You need to level with me so we can straighten this out.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Executive compensation will be based on your ability to remain at the table.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I don't have to tell you it's been a lean year for the foundation.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"First, I'd like to welcome you all to Pisa, Inc."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Welcome to our new Pisa branch.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I believe you realize the gravity of the situation.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Though novel, renting office space in Pisa was a mistake."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,And over there is the Empire State Building. Say... does that look lopsided at all to any of you?
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"At first I thought the consensus was skewed, but now I'm inclined to join you."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I believe you all understand the gravity of our situation.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Dale got tired of others talking down him.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I sense a bias here.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,I get the sense that many of you are leaning in the same direction on this.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"'Aye,' 1. ""Nay,"" seven. The ""Aye"" has it."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,A little leverage here!
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Okay, then, all those in favor of moving our offices out of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, say 'Aye'."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Could someone PLEASE call maintenance and get that painting straightened!!!
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,It's all downhill from here.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Anybody got a mint?
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Norris avoided mentioning the elephant under the room when conducting meetings.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Maybe the cruise ship offsite was a bad idea.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,You'll find working here at 45 Degree Investments a real challenge.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,My position gives me a unique perspective.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I want you all to level with me.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,The motion to move the office off the fault line is hereby passed.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Henceforth, we shall look to levelling the playing field."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Thank you for meeting in Pisa.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I move we adjourn at this point and reconvene outdoors on higher ground.
848,3,0,21,24,1.25,0.13791932109184263,528,First I want to thank each of you for weighing in on the new strategic plan.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,The motion on the floor is to remove the rollers from the chairs.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,Rumors that the company is going downhill are vastly exaggerated.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"you do know that ""cooties"" don't really exist right?"
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Perhaps you all were right, wheels were a bad idea."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Due to events beyond our control, the round table discussion has been canceled."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Why do I get the feeling you're not all leveling with me?
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,"Obviously, you do not grasp the gravity of the situation."
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,Which one of you signed off on the architect?
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,You guys are real downers!
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Is anyone still not clear that we operate on a sliding scale?
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I am finally beginning to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Profits aren't the only thing that have taken a dip this quarter.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I think this puts our disagreement in perspective.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,The company is pivoting in a new direction.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Angle? What angle? I don't have any angle.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I'm inclined to agree with you.
848,1,2,13,16,1.25,0.14433756729740643,528,Firstly I want no talk of a sinking ship !
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,We're here to discuss a matter of the utmost gravity.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,Tell me a time you went above and beyond.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"Ok, so `fair and balanced' is a bad slogan."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,This project is going downhill.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Impressed? Now let's take that vote again
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"I am sorry to say, corporate called and they're closing the Pisa office."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,I get it. I have bad breath.
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,OK. I can see which way your vote is leaning.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Simply place your hand on the table if you disagree.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Ceci n'est pas une optical illusion
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,The first one to compare this downturn to the Titanic is fired.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,Always remember our motto: Fair and Balanced.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"Okay, so how are we going to spin this? Ideas?"
848,0,6,18,24,1.25,0.0902893898143269,528,"Well, we knew Pisa wasn't to code when we moved in."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,This is the easiest way I can explain trickle down economics to you.
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"I repeat, rumours about this company being a 'sinking ship' are completely false."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,We better get paid more than the placebo group.
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,"OK, I'm gonna start by being level with you..."
848,2,2,20,24,1.25,0.12409089702567905,528,"Yes, if you think it is prudent, we can put deodorant on the agenda under new business."
848,1,4,19,24,1.25,0.1085143415353039,528,I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Next on the agenda: Infastructure
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,This is a paradigm shift.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Please roll your chair back to the table so we can continue this Sisyphus Corp. Board meeting.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,"Welcome to our annual Descendants of the Titanic meeting, or is it still too soon?"
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"...""the good news is, we're moving our headquarters back to Florence."""
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Now that I have your attention. "" Welcome to Engineering and Design!"
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Wow, I really taught you guys were on my side"
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,I told you it was a slippery slope.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Backsliders! All of you.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,We have to strike a balance.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,You people are going to be surprised by the new slant I have on the issue.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I think we need to take a different slant on this.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,You're still inside the box.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I want to get your slant on this.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,I'm confident we can ride out this slight downturn...
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,No matter what. We are fair and balanced.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Thank you for attending the final meeting of the Titanic Safety Committee. George, explain your suggestion about installing life preservers in meeting rooms."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Welcome to our annual Descendants of the Titanic meeting.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"I realize that things have been stressful around the office lately, but I assure you that we're now on the downward slope."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,I think it's time we start talking about delisting.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,The Donald has deemed us crooked.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,The latest figures suggest we're on the decline.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,i'm here to confirm that it indeed flows downhill
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I'm glad you all realize the gravity of the situation.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Obviously, you were invited to this focus group because you all lean to the right."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,This was cheaper than getting all of you shorter chairs.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,What's a Richter scale?
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,These cruise ship staff meetings would go a lot smoother if Jeff hadn't ordered us rolling chairs.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I'll be honest - things are not looking up.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,I usually hate all things European but this Dutch architecture is growing on me.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,On the upside!
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Who ever promised you an even playfield??
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,"I don't disagree that scheduling this meeting on a ship was, in hindsight, a bad idea."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,I hope you all realize the gravity of this situation.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,I feel your support slip sliding away.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Everything you do in this company will be an uphill struggle.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,We may have overshifted our paradigm
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I'm inclined to agree with you. You've put a whole new slant on it.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I would like to level with you.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,You might think I have a slanted view on this issue.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,"No, we don't lead through consensus at Teeter-Totter, Inc."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,We need to start looking at this from a new angle.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,I see no problem with wheeled chairs... motion denied.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Open Wide.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Not what I meant by 'Let's have a big rollout'.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,It's time we take this company in a new direction.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,You may have noticed recently a shift in the balance of power.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,My position is clear....
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,And that is why this is the last Frank Gehry building we will commission.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"We need bold new ideas! Remember how this company was founded: by my grandfather, over a sinkhole."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,"Well, welcome to my first cabinet meeting. I hope everyone is comfortable with my election."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,I'd like to elicit feedback on Phase One of our restructuring.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,What do you mean that I am oblivious to the gravity of the situation?
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Why don't we take just a moment to regroup?
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Things are definitely looking up, here at Teeter Totter Inc."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,"I'm going to level with you,the firm has decided to move in another direction."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"As you can see, we've undergone some restructuring."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Is it me, or is Trump Tower is leaning right too?"
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"OK team, it's time to level the playing field."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,This was the most ergonomic way for me to look down on you all.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,NOW do you understand the gravity of the situation?
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Our first order of business is to remove the wheels from our chair legs.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Is it bothering anyone else that that window is crooked?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Come on guys, my wife always makes me tuna for lunch."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Can we get a little levity in here?
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,"Yes, it's true. I'm not being level with you."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Skewed in my favor!? I resent the implication!
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,What is it that makes you think I don't value your opinion?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Seems like there might be an issue with the balance sheet.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,We don't need a bar graph to tell us how things have been going.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Now that we've leveled the monitor, I think we're ready to begin."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"40 years ago, my father started San Andreas Corporation with nothing but an abandoned building and a dream."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Is that your final answer?
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"We're at a tipping point, people."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,One of you is going out that window until we figure this out
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Is my angle on this project clear to you all?
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Clearly, our perspectives are different!"
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Of COURSE you can have a seat at the table - just not at MY table.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Let's look at it from a different angle.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,But building without a foundation saved us a lot of money.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Cutting edge design has consequences.....
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Yes, I have the zika virus--nevertheless, I'm qualified for the job."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Mr. Dibbles, that's NOT the best way to make the sales chart trend upward."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I'm comfortable with the balance of power in this company.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,So you think my argument is slanted one way?
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"You, there, on my right, what's so damned funny?"
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Well, I'm disappointed--I was hoping you'd level with me."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,What do you mean I'm not being level with you?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,This meeting of the Cruise Line Shipping Association is now called to order.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,This is what I mean by top-down decision making
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,You don't like the angle I'm coming from?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Maybe we shouldn't have chosen Pisa for our corporate offices.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Be straight with me. Is my breath really that bad?
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"According to Mr. Gehry's legal team, we simply aren't understanding the concept of the building as visualized by Mr. Gehry."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Let’s all agree that the foundation of this company isn’t strong.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"As you can see, we are currently experiencing a down side in the cruise line industry."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,......but on the upside
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,How do you all like my power office?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Can someone please straighten the screen?
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,"I prefer we use the term ""correction."""
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,I'm told it was an iceberg on Lexington.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Now onto our third corporate value: A Level Playing Field.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,We just need to change our perspective.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Sorry...beans for lunch.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Red Rover, Red Rover, send Janet right over."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"No, the table is in motion!"
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,So it's agreed. We won't have our meetings on a giant see-saw anymore.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Surprisingly, sales of the garlic-flavored breath mints fell below expectations."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Stop rocking the boat.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,We're meeting here today to address concerns about this company's perspective.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,At least it's not a full downturn.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Fine. I'LL straighten the picture frame.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Who else feels my anger has gotten out of control?
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Perhaps we can level the playing field a bit.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,This shift in policy will feel like a slippery slope for some of you.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,It probably seems like this discussion about your raises is tilted in my favor.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Pay no attention to the painting on the wall.
1009,3,0,22,25,1.24,0.13266499161421602,528,Does removing the casters deal with the symptom and not address the problem?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,And everyone said Pisa was a bad place to relocate the company.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Just so you know, naughty corners have been shown to improve efficiency by a full percentile."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"I'm still here for you, aren't I?"
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Marketing suggests 'Tippecanoe'.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Not only are you way out of order, but you also do not seem to appreciate the gravity of our situation."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Things are looking up.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Words cannot express the gravity of our current situation.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Welcome to the monthly meeting of the Pisa Chamber of Commerce.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,The whole damn scheme is collapsing.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Which one of you demanded a level playing field?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,So the balance of power shifts.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,The board thinks we'll benefit from a new perspective.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,The operative phrase here at Consolidated is...lean in.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Is everyone comfortable?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Let me try to straighten this whole thing out.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"So, I take it you all appreciate the gravity of the situation..."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Well, we all knew a ""leave"" win in the U.K. was going to cause problems for everyone."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Welcome to our corporate offices in Pisa.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I called this stockholders meeting to dispel any rumors you have heard that we are not on the level.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Anyone who wants a donut come to this side of the room.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Things may be looking up from where you are; but from here it's all downhill.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Looks like the balance of power has titled a bit.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Perhaps one of you would like to propose an adjournment?"""
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Let's look at this from another angle
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,You're in no position to negotiate
1009,3,0,22,25,1.24,0.13266499161421602,528,"Good evening, economy class employees"
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I firmly believe in the balance of power.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,I want all of you to level with me!
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"I agree, I think some leverage is needed here."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,You need to have strong hands to keep your seat at this table.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,First time in the Pisa conference room?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I thought we'd try a new angle
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I'll repeat. I need one volunteer to relocate to our location in Trenton.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,It's obvious which way the room is leaning
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,I see you have all weighed in with your opinions
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Ok, I'll stop buying my cologne from the dollar store."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,It's lonely at the top.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Can't anyone hang the art straight?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,And I don't want any cliches.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,The annual meeting of the M.C. Escher Society will now come to order.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,Brilliant! We'll put brakes on the chairs.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Then it's agreed. The next construction job that comes in, someone in the drafting room starts with a level."
1009,3,0,22,25,1.24,0.13266499161421602,528,"On second thought, maybe we shouldn't have opened a branch office in Pisa."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,We want your free unbiased opinion on this issue.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Welcome to Advanced Business Jargon Training. Repeat after me: it is a slippery slope to not give everyone a seat at the table, you're leaning against the idea, but your backs are against the wall."
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,This isn't what I meant when I said we should move some of our staff around
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I knew you were all leaning that way from the moment I sat down.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Once again, any opposed?"
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,It looks like you already know why I've called you all here.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Come to think of it, I guess it is a slanted argument."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Maybe relocating to Pisa wasn't such a good idea.
1009,3,0,22,25,1.24,0.13266499161421602,528,We're on a very slippery slope here.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"As I said, everyone slides right into their role"
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I'd like to propose that we purchase chairs without casters.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Leveling the playing field will not be as easy as you might think.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Yes, just a brief meeting . . .you go first, Sisyphus."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"All in favor of purchasing caster cups, say 'aye'."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Welcome to our first board meeting at the tallest skyscraper in the world.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,"Note to Earthquake Committee: ""Take rollers off Boardroom chairs."""
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Yes, it is a slippery slope and you are all fired."
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,We need a new angle.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Production is down. Sales are down. Profits are down...
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Anyone still thinking I was kidding when I said your backs are against the wall?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I want to put a new slant on things.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this picture?
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,My position has shifted.
1009,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,528,The last architect we hired was let go for obvious reasons.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"To commence our new Fit for Work, Fit for Life regimen, we're asking you all to scoot your chairs up to the table ten times."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,You're slant is totally wrong. Look at the big picture.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Now that we've tabled the motion, let's move on."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,This was the most affordable space.Now lets discuss the rolling chairs.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,I reject the notion that the Brexit result has been seismic.
1009,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,528,Thus concludes the July meeting of the Pisa Co-Op Association.
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"So, it's fair to say you're leaning toward restructuring."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,"Sadly, our productivity has waned since we did away with the bean bag chairs."
1009,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,528,Thank you all for weathering this current downturn.
1203,1,3,17,21,1.2380952380952381,0.11761037176408067,528,It's management's way of reminding us that upward mobility is something we have to work for.
1203,0,5,16,21,1.2380952380952381,0.09523809523809525,528,Perhaps I have underestimated the gravity of the situation.
1203,1,3,17,21,1.2380952380952381,0.11761037176408067,528,I just want to give you my slant on things.
1206,1,2,14,17,1.2352941176470589,0.13637674258081917,528,I'm sure you're wondering why I've clumped you all together.
1206,0,4,13,17,1.2352941176470589,0.10604562574894086,528,I can't help but feel that the firm has reached a tipping point.
1208,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,528,"So we need a new slant, tilt things in our favor, take a new angle, tip the scales..."
1208,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,528,Your recommendation to straighten out our finances has been rejected.
1208,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,528,Can someone fix that window?
1208,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,528,Who suggested to peg our office space to our share price?
1208,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,528,"Sorry, the rumors are true--we're downsliding."
1208,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,528,"Would you agree, the geometry doesn't feel right in this room?"
1208,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,528,It IS lonely at the top--but I like it.
1215,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,528,It's not just getting a seat at the table. It's holding onto it.
1215,0,5,17,22,1.2272727272727273,0.09144861547306328,528,Pay attention folks because I have another surprise today. When I've finished we will hit the All You Can Eat Buffet with the Captain.
1215,0,5,17,22,1.2272727272727273,0.09144861547306328,528,I wish you guys could see this from my perspective.
1215,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,528,"Yes, if I'm so inclined."
1215,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,528,"Unfortunately, we are not prepared to have lower level employees come to the table"
1215,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,528,"When I say ""ramp up"", I mean it."
1215,2,1,19,22,1.2272727272727273,0.13046401009454234,528,Any more questions regarding the 80-20 rule?
1215,0,5,17,22,1.2272727272727273,0.09144861547306328,528,I'm becoming inclined to agree.
1215,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,528,I've called you all here today to discuss downsizing.
1215,1,3,18,22,1.2272727272727273,0.11265812709673687,528,"As you might have noticed, we have discovered a slight problem in our building design."
1215,0,5,17,22,1.2272727272727273,0.09144861547306328,528,It seems the odds have now tipped in your favor.
1226,0,4,14,18,1.2222222222222223,0.10083169033033668,528,The company has reached a tipping point.

1227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,528,"As you've probably guessed, we're on a bit of a downslide."
1227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,528,Management wants you all to have a seat at the table...
1227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,528,"Sorry, this is as level as the playing field is gonna get!"
1227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,528,Apparently the line graph wasn't clear enough
1227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,528,"If there is any dissent, I will let go of this table."

1227,0,5,18,23,1.2173913043478262,0.08793911249520546,528,I press this button and 'voilà!' I control the floor.
1227,0,5,18,23,1.2173913043478262,0.08793911249520546,528,I don't think tabling the proposal will work.

1227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,528,So you're saying my argument doesn't carry that much weight?
1227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,528,May I assume you all have the same slant on this?

1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,HR has received several complaints about the weight of your consciences.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,It was supposed to be a metaphor!
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,The meeting of the Titanic Historic Society will now come to order.
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,We need to pivot.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Duly noted.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,I'm going to let go of the table now.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,OK folks! The learning curve is going to be a little steeper on this next project.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,I believe in being upfront about the uneven playing field.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,Anyone want to weigh in on this discussion?
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,There has been a seismic shift in our industry
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,All I said was maybe Trump wouldn't be the worst candidate in history.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"You may be correct and unified, but your thoughts are slanted."
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,I guess you're all on the same side then.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,As a temporary fix we will remove all the casters.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"Well, I think it's already an even playing field."
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,My research didn't show the company as being this top heavy.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,Why do I always get the feeling you guys are siding against me?
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,The Lombard Street Homeowners Association meeting will please come to order.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,So the resolution is passed... No more Board meetings on the Titanic
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Welcome to the Economic House of Mystery.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"As I tried to explain, the company is at sea."
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,Is my breath that bad?
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"And this is why, I believe, I should be named interim captain"
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,The Leaning Tower of Pisa had the lowest rental rates. Shall we continue?
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"Now, let's look at this from a different angle!"
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,There are a number of things that we need to straighten out.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,It's all in your head.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I find this distracts people from the fact that I'm 9 inches tall.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"Remember, YOU, are our greatest asset at Pisa Incorporated....."
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,So we are agreed. Next week we move the meeting out of Pisa.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,Any questions about corporate structure?
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,I just don't think any of you are on my level.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,We've reconfigured the conference room to encourage team building and collaboration.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,You look hostile!
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"Why not credit my not having decided to put wheels on the table, too?"
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"So, who wants free tickets to the Summer Olympics?"
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"All those in favor of reducing the seating capacity, carefully raise your hand."
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I'd like to set the room straight about a few things.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"I now call to order, our meeting of Nelophobics Anonymous!"
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I'll promote anyone who swings the vote my way.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,You may feel that the weight of the argument is on your side ...
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"Alright, who's responsible for hanging the crooked whiteboard?"
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,Managing this company is an uphill roll.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Next item on the agenda: getting seats without wheels.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"Alright then, has everyone oiled their little wheels like I asked?"
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I'm flattered by how much you all look up to me.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Next applicant. Mr. Sysiphus?
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,"No need to put ' Whoops, damn ! ' in the minutes, Gretchen."
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,This is not about picking sides.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I'd appreciate it if you'd level with me.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Are you suggesting I'm not on the level?
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,You people need to level with me.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"metaphorically, we have something going on here, don't we?"
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,This chapter's annual meeting of the Flat Earth Society is called to order. Is there any old business?
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"We want you, as jurors, to understand the concept of tipping the scales of justice."
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"As always, I will be completely straight with you."
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,This feels like a lopsided conversation.
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,I'm pleased to get the opportunity to address House Republicans on Climate Change.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"Normally, I would never slant things in my favor, however . . . ."
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I can tell this news weighs heavily on you.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"As you can see, I've got the leverage."
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,"Mr. Trump chose concrete over steel for economy, but they poured too much on this side of the tower."
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Our key goal is to create a level playing field.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,I see sentiment has tilted in your favor.
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,But then it all went down hill from there
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Standing desks are out. Hiking desks are in!
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,You are instructed to reach a verdict before the ship goes down.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I resent your inference that this business is not on the level
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,Unfortunately our foundation is teetering on the brink of extinction
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"So, the motion is for next firm retreat ashore. Seconder?"
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,While I understand that my predecessor was fond of the so-called roundtable discussion . . .
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,I'm here to tell you that the balance of power has shifted.
1350,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,528,"""A level playing field is not an idea whose time has come, is that clear ?"
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"Why, yes, I feel I can meet the unique challenges of working here at the Tilt-A-Whirl Corporation."
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,We'd like to make upward mobility a reality.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,Didn't they tell you? This is a Trump building.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,New aftershave. Too much?
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,I just wanted to give you a heads up
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,"Perhaps, relocating to Pisa isn't as glamorous as I thought."
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,This is our new board set-up. Now it's easy to tell who is the boss.
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,"Now that we are in agreement, we can move on."
1350,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,528,This is why I sit at the head of the table.
1350,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,528,Now that's a thought. Maybe carpeting would be the solution.
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,So we all agree on the gravity of this situation?
1536,0,3,12,15,1.2,0.10690449676496973,528,Pardon the paradigm shift
1536,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,528,"As you have all probably guessed, our sales are on a decline."
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,There's no easy way to say it: We're fighting an uphill battle.
1536,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,528,The gravity of this situation sure has pulled us together.
1536,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,528,The moment when Bill suspects his aftershave lotion is too strong.
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,We are going to work as a team.
1536,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,528,The inaugural board of directors meeting for the RMS Titanic.
1536,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,528,You guys asked for the board retreat on a cruise.
1536,1,1,13,15,1.2,0.14474937289114914,528,I just don't see the upside.
1536,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,528,Im tabling our discussion of gravity
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,"And lastly, I'm inclined to ask HR for a department wide raise of 25 degrees."
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,I want to make leaning in a challenge.
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,We're being smeared as not fair or balanced by the liberals.
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,"All in favor of abandoning ship, say aye."
1536,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,528,The odds are in your favor.

1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,Ideally we'd be having this disaster preparedness training sometime before the actual disaster.
1536,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,528,"Let me start by saying, 'our news media is free and balanced.'"
1536,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,528,This situation demands your utmost gravitas.

1556,1,3,22,26,1.1923076923076923,0.09638433912416669,528,"Lean in, dammit, lean in!"
1558,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,528,Welcome to the Titanic Boardroom where our motto is Never Let Go
1558,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,528,This isn't exactly what I meant when I said I wanted you to come up with a new angle
1558,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,528,What gives you the impression I talk down to each of you?
1558,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,528,"Actually, I have the upper hand"
1558,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,528,The meeting of the OCD club will now come to order.
1558,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,528,"According to the latest polls, there is a noticeable tilt to the right."
1558,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,528,I still say we stay calm and rearrange the deck chairs.
1558,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,528,I never said it was going to be an even playing field!

1558,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,528,I can see which way the room is leaning.

1574,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,528,Ok. But what's our angle?

1577,2,0,20,22,1.1818181818181819,0.1254664653349735,528,So who can guess what's about to roll downhill?

1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,Ladies and Gentlemen: I am sorry to announce that our company is going downhill.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Now that I have everyone's attention . . .!
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,We need to straighten things out.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I wanted you to get a different perspective on our growth chart.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,"Okay, I think I've held the table long enough so I'm gonna pass it one of you."

1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Happens every time the paradigm shifts..
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,All right. Meeting on a cruise ship was a bad idea.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,"Politically, however, we lean to the left."

1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,Ironically our share price is rising.

1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,I table the motion
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,Advancement is an uphill climb - not everyone will make it!
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,"Well, maybe if you all worked a little harder we could afford to fix the sinkhole."
1577,2,0,20,22,1.1818181818181819,0.1254664653349735,528,I call this meeting out of order.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,"This is called ""leverage"" in the boardroom. Now cast your vote."
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I'm not going tot lie to you..this will be an uphill battle.
1577,2,0,20,22,1.1818181818181819,0.1254664653349735,528,I wanted a fresh slant on our Chapter 11 decision.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,All you really need to do is straighten out the picture.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,So by now I hope you all understand the difference between slant and spin.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I need to level with you all: We need a different angle.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I am beginning to appreciate the gravity of the situation.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,"As I explained to everyone, it's not a level playing field."
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,Rogue waves are actually rather rare

1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,I thought we'd try a different angle.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,We need to approach this from a different angle.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,"Clearly, we have to turn this ship around."
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,I think I've figured out how to level out our declining stock price.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,OK ... I'm going to level with you.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Thank you for weighing in.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,This group is tipping to the right.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Shall we continue discussing the potential earthquakes here in Oklahoma?

1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,I can't stress enough how important it is to work together as a group.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,As you can see we expect our summer interns to claw their way to the top like everybody else here.

1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I think you're leaning in the wrong direction.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,I apologize for the misspelling in the memo. This is a Pisa party.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,"Clearly, It's time to level the field in this organization."
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,You don't seem to like it so much when the table's turned.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,"I assure you, it will 'trickle down' to you ar some point,"

1577,2,0,20,22,1.1818181818181819,0.1254664653349735,528,Look at the big picture. It’s level.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,And this concludes the first annual board meeting of the Titanic...
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,How would you rate our intern icebreaker events?
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I suggest you reweigh your conclusions.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I spoke with the board. We're going in another direction.
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,Is it my halitosis?
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,I suppose that now you believe me when I say the company is going downhill.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,We are all facing a downhill problem.

1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Like Trump I'm taking the company in a new direction without directors.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,I learned this leverage technique from my children.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,I thought we might get more done this meeting if we approached things from a different angle.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Could someone please straighten that dang painting!
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,This is what 51% really means.

1577,2,0,20,22,1.1818181818181819,0.1254664653349735,528,I propose we let the matter slide until the next meeting.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,The motion to move the conference room to a lower floor is seconded.
1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Shall we try a new slant on this?
1577,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,528,Everything is fine. This is fine. Don't worry.

1577,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,528,Is it just me or is the painting a little crooked?
1661,1,1,15,17,1.1764705882352942,0.12820291010413745,528,SILENT MAJORITIES CAN CARRY LOTS OF WEIGHT
1661,1,1,15,17,1.1764705882352942,0.12820291010413745,528,What makes you think the playing field is uneven?
1661,1,1,15,17,1.1764705882352942,0.12820291010413745,528,This is what I meant when I said our work force was unbalanced.
1661,1,1,15,17,1.1764705882352942,0.12820291010413745,528,It's just so you remember that I'm chairman of the board.
1665,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,528,I know things don't seem to be leaning my way now but you'll see!!!
1665,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,528,"So, are you guys leaning one way or the other on this?"
1665,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,528,Privileged? My grandfather EARNED my father's RIGHT to put me here.
1665,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,528,It's time I leveled with you.
1665,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,528,This meeting seems a little one-sided
1665,2,0,21,23,1.173913043478261,0.12014770081874042,528,"No really, this is on the level."

1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Aw-choo! Must've brought back that thing everybody's catching in Brazil. ...
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Perhaps we can do without the casters?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I am sorry to report that the downward trend will continue for the foreseeable future.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Before we discuss this matter you should all know that we are on a slippery slope here.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Now you know why I'm always at the head of the table.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Look guys, I shouldn't have to throw my weight around all the time."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Our strategy of vertical AND horizontal integration has really skewed profits.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Try leaning in.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Does anyone else have another slant on this topic?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I've cancelled the coffee and donut holes for obvious reasons.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"I thought this was a start-up, not a start-down!"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,All of the staff is now being evaluated on a sliding scale.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,So much for the level playing field idea.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,We are experiencing a downward trend.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,My argument seems to carry a lot of weight
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Our firm is right-leaning? That's all in your perspective.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,The immediate effect of Brexit on our business fundamentals is apparent.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Surely you can all appreciate my perspective.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,You're being downsized.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I concede. The company has indeed reached its tipping point.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Motion adopted: Next year's board meeting will NOT be on a cruise ship.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,The nays have it.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,This is a strategic shift.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Our corporate architectural structure now is in congruence with our corporate compensational structure.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Have I impressed on you what it's like being on a sinking ship?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"And, finally, I yield the floor to an agenda item carried over from our last session: sinkholes and conference-room traction."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,And this is why you claim it's so hard to balance the budget?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I knew that contractor with the eye patch was all wrong for the job!
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"And remember, in this company you can count on a level playing field."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I see that building a strong team will be an uphill battle.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,That's perfect - I finally have cell reception!
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,The jury's still out on whether recent unusual tectonic shifts are due to fracking or sun spot activity.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Ok, you win, it is SUPER glue."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Our new seating is based off of the revised org chart.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Admittedly, our business is trending downward."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I asked the architect for a design that would bring the team together.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,And our sales have been sliding also .
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Well, I see that my decision to stay on has weighed heavily on all of you..."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Now you all are looking up to me, we can proceed."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I need to speak with you about an issue of some gravity.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I think you all know why I've called you here.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Okay everyone, meeting adjourned until they've finished changing the flat tire."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Looks like the whiteboard didn't get the memo...
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,This company is slowly going to go under.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Who has some time to head up a sink hole committee?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"'John, please take the floor.'"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,If you think this is a bit awkward think how I feel.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,We need to address this issue of boardroom bias.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"As you may have noticed, we've done some restructuring."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I still say this newsroom slants to the right.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I expect this downturn will be temporary.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Imagine you're on a sinking ship while we brainstorm Brexit strategy.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Since Brexit, we've been experiencing a downward trend."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Now, I know this must look like an uphill battle from your perspective, but..."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Rest assured; I bought your company to run it with you as equal partners.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I've been saying this Board was on a slippery slope for years!
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Once the Brexit settles in, the markets should level off again."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"That was a 7, okay? You don't want to see me go to 10."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Sure, there are going to be some challenges, but conference space in Pisa is not cheap!"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,It's come to my attention that some of you have your own slant on how I'm running things.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"They said BREXIT might be a tipping point, but, this is ridiculous!"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Renting office space at the Tower of Pisa was destined to present some problems.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,All in favor raise your heads.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I can see that achieving consensus will be an uphill battle...
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I'm with you in spirit.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Kurt admitted he was taking everyone's snacks from their bagged lunches.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,It's a new negotiation strategy.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Please remember - my vote carries the most weight.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Well, this is a new slant to board meetings."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Guys, we all know I'm not the only one who voted for Brexit."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,It was the dog.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Why do you assume it was me?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,We must address the criticism that we are slanted to the right.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,It really wasn't my intention to sway the jury.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Anybody got any ideas why sales of our new deodorant soap are so awful?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Has anyone else noticed we seem to be sliding this quarter?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Are you sure you want me to table this discussion?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Oh ooo-kay, now I see your point. Perhaps Frank Gehry wasn't the best choice for the new building. My bad."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I hope you all now see the gravity of this situation.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,We really cornered the market!
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,It makes the year's financials presentation look much better.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Corporate thinks we're backsliding.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I must concede that opinion has tipped in another direction.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Okay. Okay. I get it. The floors are a little uneven.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I really think you guys need to level with me.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Earthquake? What earthquake?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Our last board meeting on the Titanic shall please come to order!
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"The earthquake doesn't excuse you, I excuse you."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Did you all get enough lunch?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Welcome to your first private tutorial at Trump U.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"So, I'm the only one taking the high road here?"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,The level playing field is highly overrated.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,It's not too late to right this ship.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,The needs of the many outweighs the needs of the CEO
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Allow me to present a different slant.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Clearly, our demographics are leaning to the Right."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Clearly the weight of evidence supports my view.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I don't think I need to explain the company bias.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"C'mon, folks! Haven't you ever seen a crooked wall chart?"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"See, it's like we're all sitting at the head of the table."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Try putting velcro on the bottom of your wheels like I do.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"So, offshoring doesn't mean moving to a boat?"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Not what I meant by lean business, people!"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,ok....office chairs unlocked it is then.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,This isn't working. We need to develop a better slant!
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I had hoped you wouldn't notice my fart.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I assure you this offer is on the level.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"I now realize that my overuse ""reaching out to you"" and ""circling back"" in all forms of communication is viewed as micro-aggression."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I think you all are aware of the gravity of our situation.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Since no further motion is possible, the meeting is adjourned."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,In spite of the majority vote we will not proceed to appeal the Law of Gravity.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"So, how do you feel about my proposal?"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Is it really the floor or the corned beef and onions I had for lunch?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,The majority weighs in.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Now don't worry. As you all know, it's my job to right the ship."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Southern California has many other advantages !
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Cooties isn't supposed to be a thing anymore, you guys!"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I think we should get a different perspective.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Any objections to the sliding scale format?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"And we thank Jan for this week’s piece of participatory art entitled ""Sisyphus didn't have to do it in heels."""
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I notice this focus group is a little one sided. . .
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Which one of you touched my frame?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Let's remember to lock the wheels before the next meeting.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,A: Our sales are up -OR- B: Our sales are down. Who wants to guess?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"From where I sit, it's all downside."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,The playing field is(italics) level.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Franklin's propensity for alienation finally turned the entire office against him.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Brexit has turned things a bit askew.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Looks like our robot has been tinkering with the law of gravity again.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I'm happy to see my board members so tightly knit!
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I'd like to welcome you all to the Bay Area.

1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I'm afraid I had too many martinis for lunch.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Alright, whose bright idea to have this years board meeting on a sailboat?"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,All in favor of chairs with no wheels say 'I'
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I get the impression that someone is rocking the boat.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,It seems like we're in a quarterly decline.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Remember: If you think you are something that flows downhill, it's just an illusion."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Admittedly, things appear slightly skewed toward management."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"So, you see, once you make senior vice president, it's all downhill from there..."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,They told me it was only an illusion.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,All opposed?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,And then it hit me...the concept of what flows downhill is perfect for our boardroom.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I am tabling the motion.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Does this mean all options are off the table?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I was told I have a knack for putting a slant on things.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"At this point in our discussion, your obsession with unity has cost you the high ground."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I have a new angle on the problem.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Your opinions carry great weight.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,This actuarial table will help us balance the books.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I guess we now know which one of us got the chair with the broken casters.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Now that I graduated from Trump University there are going to be some changes around here.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Now, let's address the issue of unequal pay."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Of course, there may be those who feel our policies are slanted against a them."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Whoops!
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"First, I want to address my concerns about the outstanding balance I found in all of your accounts..."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Rearranging the chairs is a good first step, but will it make us great again?"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I never said it was a level playing field.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Your slant on things is not making sense.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Let's discuss 'leaning in.'
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Sorry about the garlic.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I think if we get our expenses down we can level things off this quarter.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"So, I see that the board is slightly slanted in your favor."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,The Power of the one out weighs the needs of the many.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,We can't deny obvious. You are all in a slump.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,This meeting has reached a tipping point
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"When I said you all need to pull your weight, this is not what I meant"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Trust is a difficult thing to learn.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"I can't hold this table forever, you know."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,It's no coincidence that our stock is at an all-time low
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"If you think I'm wrong, level with me!"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"And now, I trust, you can all see my angle."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"What do mean, things have tilted in my favor??"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Tilt the room all you want, I'm still the decider."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Now this is what I call uneven representation!
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I told you the new board room would get things rolling!
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"What shall we tackle next, the glass ceiling or the floor of discontent?"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Note the illusion of revenue growth.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I feel like no one here is on my side.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Carl was always talking down to his colleagues.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,We're here to implement a paradigm shift in our business model.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,We have to stop letting things slide.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,So you're saying my views are slanted and out of touch?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Side effects include . . .
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Welcome to halitosis anonymous.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Is it my imagination that you all seem to be leaning toward taking early retirement?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Thank you all for siding with me on the budget cuts.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Welcome to the inaugural meeting of Titanic Enterprises.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I was thinking more along the lines of a happy hour or a ropes course
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Have we really stooped to a new level?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I think we took a wrong turn with our decision to begin fracking.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Our next retreat will be on dry land.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"OK, who drew the rectangle?"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Sorry, our glass ceiling just wasn't quite cutting it."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I humble suggest we postpone our discussions.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I'd like to welcome everyone to our Tokyo office.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I sure picked the right chair today.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"OK, whose idea was it to have our board meeting on an ocean cruise?"""
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,You're positions are clearly untenable
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"Well, I see you are all weighted towards one opinion."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I'll concede; that question was a bit weighted.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Thank you for participating in our 'Innovations in Architecture' focus group.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"All in favor of removing the casters from the chairs, say ""Aye!"""
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"So summing up, the business has been a bit of a roller-coaster lately."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,We lean a little to the right on this one.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I think we're becoming a bottom-heavy organisation
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,It's not a complete slide. The TV is still upright.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Don't be concerned. This 3D app is a Beta and will straighten itself out with the next download.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Well ... maybe it's not such a good idea.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Don't mistake this for the moral high ground.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Your opinions weigh heavily on this room.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"Yes Jim, you're right. The artwork is still level. And that is why our self-leveling frames will revolutionize cruise ship decorating!"
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Just roll with me for a moment.
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"In hindsight, when I built this office tower, I should have hired a professional."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,You're safe with us. Our planet doesn't even allow seed patents.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"That's right, I don't watch Game of Thrones and I'm damn proud of it."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"You know what they say about big halos, right?"
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,Ready for another weighty decision?
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,"We're serving humans, and you look well done."
1878,1,1,18,20,1.15,0.10942433098048311,528,I want you all to look up to me in this time of crisis.
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,How many times do I have to tell you... Bankruptcy isn't contagious
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,Now that I have your undivided attention---might we forge ahead?
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,"As the new trainees, you must understand from the get go that it flows downhill."
1878,0,3,17,20,1.15,0.08191780219091255,528,I know you are all going to take a conservative position on this matter.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I'd like to make a motion.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"Like I told you, it's all downhill from here."
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,"As you can see by the slope of this room, sales are down."
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I guess I don't need to tell you--there's been a slight downturn.
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,Let me give you my slant on the matter.
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,"AS I have explained before, there is no such thing as a level playing field, that is why you are down there and I am up here."
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,Perhaps I'm offering a slanted opinion.
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,"As Math Department chairman, I view this as a very bad sine."
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I know you're all angling for a seat at the table.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"All those who think we should get rid of the wheels on the chairs say ""aye."""
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,You must understand this group does not follow majority rule
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,Anybody else have a different slant on it?
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"First, who is the bonehead that scheduled this meeting on a boat?"
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,Business is a slippery slope.
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,I thought it only fair to level the playing field.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"As you know, we charge our clients on a sliding scale."
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,Anyone leaning a different way?
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I think we need to look at this from a different angle.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,What makes you think things around here are not on the level?
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"Despite your misgivings, this is a titanic opportunity."
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"Ladies and gentlemen, the landscape of our company is changing."
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,I guess we should re-think the recipe of our new breath mints.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I can see my new program for the company to expand is causing a wee bit of listing.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"Our company was started with a shaky foundation, so this is no surprise."
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,Watch out! Here I come!
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,How about this for a balance of power?
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,Let's table this discussion until we can take a more balanced perspective on the matter.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I did not realize that our business management team was so lopsided.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,Sheryl said to LEAN IN not back.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,Why can't you see management's point of view?
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,I regret to inform you that this merger has created an unfortunate leadership imbalance.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I'm confident we'll be up next quarter
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,"Ok, now that we're on even ground, let's discuss raises."
2122,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,528,The tables have turned. My raise or I let go.
2122,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,528,I’d like to call this meeting to visual order.

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I'm afraid the meeting is going to go downhill from here on.

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"As you can see, my side is heavier."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I now call this meeting of the Pisa Foundation to order.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,The company's been on a downward slope.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Trump you say? Enjoy the ride!
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I guess I don't have to tell you that our business is down.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,It's time to balance the budget.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Ok. Much like the Brexit vote, if you decide to really leave, you can't come back."

2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"In retrospect, the architect's affinity for Marx might have been a dead giveaway."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,...and the flatulence goes away in about 10 days.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I don't like talking down to people but...
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"I don't know how this office would run without you! But as of Monday, I'm going to find out.”"
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Unfortunately for Michael, the acoustics of the room weren't that great."

2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,I wanted the right balance on the team.

2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,I asked the architect to reflect the volatile economy in our boardroom.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You're all fired!
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Sorry to keep you all weighting.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Yes, I understand it's an issue that's weighing heavy on everyone's mind. Bottom line: Approximately how high would this wall need to be to keep both Donald AND Hillary out?"
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Talk about imbalance of power.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Yet ironically, all your 401k plans are up."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Your probe went well... we'll see you in six months for your follow-up.

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"All those in favor, roll this way in the next wave."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,I now call to order this inaugural meeting of the Gravity Hills Club.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Yep, Bobbies, it's all downhill now."

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,No need to be afraid.

2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"So, everyone is going to be replaced by human-like robots, and, in fact, I'm not your boss anymore, but one of the prototypes in test. Uncanny isn't it?"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Let's try again, no religion."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Am I the only one that feels the company shifting as we speak?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Gesundheit!
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,How do you want your crop circles?

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"If I may sir, speaking on behalf of our group your picture needs ""straightening""."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,I wanted to create a level playing field for these negotiations.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"On behalf of the mayor, I'd like to welcome you to San Francisco."

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I'm afraid that your reasoning is something of a slippery slope.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,And this room is designed to illustrate how certain things roll around here.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Today our magazine will begin to print articles exclusively in italics.

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,This room was designed for dissension
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Was it everything I said?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,This room is as straight as this Will.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Let's not hold the next board meeting on a cruise ship.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I think I've figured out why you've all been feeling like things are going downhill lately.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"I have heard your complaints about, ""inequalities in the office"" and I'd like to say that you seem no different to me now then before."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Always remember I am the Captain of this listing boardroom.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"As you can see, my level-playing-field policy has us well-positioned for what comes next."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,The resolution to table the committee membership has passed . . .
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,I'm inclined to oppose your table.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Everything about this company is going downhill.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,We can table it. Or I could just let it go.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Any more questions about why the board meeting was moved to Pisa?

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"From this angle, our numbers look fine."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Ah. But you see, I have RIGHT on my side."

2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"So, you think this organization is a little bit slanted? Why would you say that?"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"The key is putting paper clips in the rollers; oh yes, and hiring an architect who does not drink."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,And who wants to volunteer for this assignment?
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Does this have anything to do with the group snapchat I sent last night?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Welcome to our new office in Pisa, Italy."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Pitch me.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"We are down in the pols, so everthing if off the table."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Let's talk about advantageous positioning.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,I just thought we could use a new perspective on business.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Last Monday's earthquake drill was not a success.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"""As you know, it's all down hill from here!"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I farted.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I think we can all agree that it's in everybody's best interest that some members should reconsider their position.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Welcome, everyone, to the Tower of Pisa Convention Center. Let's get started."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Good news and bad news... The good news 1st: the 2 week contagion period is over. And now the bad news: Did you hear on the news this morning how a Lab tech got fired for mixing up test results?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You're right. Black does make you look heavier.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"To a degree, it is impossible to bring everyone together at the same table!!"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,And next week's team building exercise will be a juice cleanse.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"I acknowledge the weight of your arguments, but I still win."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Welcome to bizarro-Pisa
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"well, I suppose the 'cluster focus' is one approach...."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,At least we saved money on chair brakes!
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Yes, my dear employees, the word Titanic was used as an Euphemism."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Shape up, people. Do you like being shoved in a corner and going downhill fast?"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Yes, you have the numbers. But that doesn't necessarily mean you have the high ground."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Now that I've got your attention...
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,It’s a metaphor for this Quarter’s Balance Sheet.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Let me fill you in on our new offshore operation.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Stop tickling my palm-It makes me uncomfortable.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Check with Gladwell. I think we've passed the 'tipping point.'
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Guess we won't need the Ouija board to divine the selection of CEO.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,You should know this crop you're buying is genetically modified.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""culture"" of income inequality..."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Well, Lois, as the chairman of this board, no, I don't see things going downhill."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,What do you mean you want to level the playing field?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Failure to lean in.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I guess our new slant on business has its downside.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You guys are a bunch of lightweights!
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I'm concerned about the direction of the company.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,The first meeting of the Titanic Friendship Society will now come to order.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Now this is what it feels like when our stock plummets like the Titanic.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"First off, I'd like to congratulate you all on making it to the third round of interviews."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You are all now set to scale new heights!
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,San Francisco City Council please come to order...
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Apparently I am the only Democrat on this Right Leaning Board.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,marco. polo.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Management now has the upper hand and we are initiating the following new work rules:
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Need I remind you the ship is sinking?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"As the boss, I hope you all now realize that you will be fighting an uphill battle anytime you disagree with me."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Past performance may not guarantee future results, but in this case, it's a pretty good predictor."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"...and yet, Ladies and Gentlemen...the picture is still straight!"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"""I believe the business has finally turned a corner""."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Yes, Bill, I did promise you all a seat at the table."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Just to be clear, let's put it to a referendum."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You didn't lean in!
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Well, this just got more awkward, but what I said was all of you ARE let go"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Our company is on the upswing.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Now THIS week we need a new slant on our work METAPHORICALLY.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Is it the work of our 3-D Virtual Reality design team?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Just push your chair away from the table.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"To be completely fair, I was chosen by sliding scale."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"Let's face it, we need a level playing field!"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Even flat organizations have to pivot from time to time. Ours was at the midpoint.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"The playing field, perhaps. But not the board room!"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I'm afraid it's all downhill from here.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,We work on a sliding pay scale.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You've got to get the right slant on this.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Management has asked me to come clean about something. We all work in a yellow submarine.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,It means stingy!
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,If this downward trend continues there will be serious repercussions.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,There will be no raises this year!
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Any attempt to climb your way to the top may be hampered by an uneven playing field.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Or we could draw straws.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I know I am thinking outside the box.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You seem to have moved in another direction......
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Ok who wants to go first?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Maybe that pitch has too much slant.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"So, what you are telling me is that we need to right this ship."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,The tabled issue is now tilted in my favor
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"You're right, I would rather get an anal probe than decide between Trump or Hillary."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Remember: expectation plus perception equals a slanted view.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I called you here today to discuss the importance of using a level.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"You all need to trust me, I'm sitting at the head of this table for a reason."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Oops!!! Looks like the Dow just took a downturn...
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Great meeting! So we can conclude that excrement flows downhill in this company.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I'll take that as a definite maybe.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Think about it - there are no mortgages in space!
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"I thought the company wanted a leader with gravitas, but if you prefer gravity, fine."
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Clearly, the table has turned."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,You say workplace loyalty is shifting?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Some of you may have expected a level playing field---welcome to the real world.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Now that we've reached international waters, let's discuss our overtime policy."
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,"I agree, mobilization is important, but is it scalable from there?"
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,I guess you're all wondering why I've gathered you here today.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,This just demonstrates why this committee must mount a vigorous protest against more fracking.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,What makes you think that our profits are on the downslide?
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Welcome to our first deferred maintenance re-conceptualization workshop!
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,We will need to work together if we are going to right this ship.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,Sorry. This room used to belong to Trump.
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,I know it seems like we're a bit at sea here...
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,Abandon hope - for a level playing field - all ye who enter here.
2798,1,0,19,20,1.1,0.1,528,"Who says our ""annual sales at sea"" meeting isn't a great idea?"
2798,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,528,welcome to Gravity Inc.

3197,1,0,20,21,1.0952380952380953,0.09523809523809525,528,The board seems tilted in favor of not having our new building designed by Frank Gehry.

3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,Jeremy liked to address his managers from a position of authority.
3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,I'm voting for Trump and that's it.
3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,Imagine how much more slippery the slope will be if Trump becomes President!
3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,I see we are leaning right on this issue.

3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,"I was waiting for Walker, but it looks like he declined the meeting."
3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,"You would think that the CEO of a major oral antiseptic company, would know how to use it."
3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,Remind me who's idea it was to book our corporate retreat on the Titanic.

3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,And they said rearranging the chairs wouldn't make a difference...
3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,I feel like you have a very slanted world view

3197,1,0,20,21,1.0952380952380953,0.09523809523809525,528,Mr Trump has assured me that this building is fantastic and your disgusting chairs are rolling to be politically correct.
3197,0,2,19,21,1.0952380952380953,0.06563832739090583,528,I thinks it's clear that profits are down.
