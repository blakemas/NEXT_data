13,3,0,' Cooee, he's behind you.'
13,3,0,Safest place our friend could be!!
14,3,0,The rifle's a bluff. He only hunts for worms.
16,3,0,If ya can't beat 'em, join 'em I guess.
17,7,1,Don't you think Junior has taken "riding shotgun" to an extreme.
18,7,2,That's the last place he'll look
18,0,3,Bravery might be a virtue, but far-sightedness is bliss.
13,3,0,Now that's Chutzpah!
11,0,0,Birds of a feather flock together.
19,8,3,I bet him five worms he wouldn't do that.

19,4,2,Stay alert - technically, he's not 'in hand.'
22,4,5,I guess it's like being a gay Republican.
15,2,2,Stockholm syndrome strikes again!
17,3,2,Worms! They're hunting worms!
16,7,1,Well, it's what you call the cat bird seat.
13,4,0,Well, you know what they say, "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer!"
13,2,0,Don't fret, he's not one to squawk.
24,11,5,Personally, I prefer not to ride shotgun if I can help it!
12,2,0,That tweet has flown the coop. He's half-cocked.
12,0,0,Very good, but for my 'Truth or Dare' task, I'm going to have to flip him my middle claw.
11,1,0,I knew it when he stopped tweeting.
13,2,0,He's one of those "right to be shot" birdbrains.

10,4,0,I suppose there are worse hiding places...
22,7,4,He says this is the only way to "make the forest great again"

17,2,1,Let's hope a bird on the barrel is worth two in the bush
18,5,1,Ever since they exchanged tweets, she's had his back.
10,0,0,I thought Johnny said he was a pacifist?

12,1,0,Not exactly a bird in hand but I think we might be safe.
13,2,0,We needed a way to continue natural selection
29,16,9,I hate how he insists on riding shotgun all of the time
14,1,1,How many tweets could a twitter twit tweet if a twitter twit could tweet tweets?
10,0,0,It's a decoy, fool!!
18,6,3,Best mocking bird in the business
15,1,1,He seemed oblivious. Surely a bird on the gun was worth two on a branch.

16,1,1,Tweety Tweety Bang Bang.
13,0,0,I know the hand, and the bush, but what's the sight worth?
17,6,1,We always knew he was a son of a gun!

40,18,16,Those protected species are such smart-asses.
14,5,0,I don't mind his species fluidity. What disturbs me is his support of the NRA.
21,4,4,The man still hasn't realized he can't actually whistle.
17,4,1,Stockholm Syndrome? Maybe, but I'm thinking more like turncoat.
11,0,0,That little tweet is showing off again.

27,22,11,I'm starting to think he's not college material.

15,3,1,The NRA has really gone to the birds this year, wouldn't you say?
23,9,2,Hope that her cell phone doesn't ring.
17,3,1,What's a bird on the gun worth?
12,1,0,He's overthinking if he just wants to kill us.
36,35,15,Sweetie, we might be empty nesters sooner than we thought.

15,0,1,They met about two years ago and he replaced the gun action with a camera.
11,0,0,I need you to look alive when you take the stand.
12,2,0,That's a red breasted quisling.
12,1,0,Where was he when that so called friend of Dick Cheney really needed him?

15,5,1,Now that's a Cuckoo bird.

17,7,1,He must be in need of a little seed money...
17,3,2,140 word obit coming up.
16,4,1,That quail knows Dick Cheney shoots only lawyers.
13,3,1,46, 47, 48 - he just might make a new personal best
27,16,9,These kids today with their extreme sports.
13,2,0,Don't worry. He's a remaining delegate. Nobody knows where he is, much less what he wants, including himself.
15,2,1,That's my wingman.
11,0,0,Your delusion is encroaching on our recess.
17,6,1,He said he wanted to take a stand on gun control. I'm not sure he understands the issue.
14,4,0,Well, I, for one, say she is relying too much on her membership card to the NRA.
14,5,0,That's why they call it a Peep Sight.
24,9,6,I tell you, they both need glasses.
11,0,0,It's Elmer and he's a pacifist.
19,2,0,He's not fooling anyone with that decoy.

16,4,1,It's actually pretty safe there.
16,1,1,She's a firm believer in gun patrol.
21,5,4,Performance artists are the worst.
20,7,3,Cataracts.
14,5,0,I still can't believe our kid joined the N.R.A!
10,0,0,no, the mustache is real
12,2,0,Well, he's got her back.
16,1,1,He wasn't like this before those jays moved into the neighborhood.
11,0,0,It won't make a difference. He doesn't have the votes.
12,2,0,Rookie mistake. Take the gun, leave the canary.

18,4,3,I have no clue why Doug insists on riding shotgun.
14,0,1,More like two birds with one snitch...
18,7,1,"Do you think he knows he's not sitting on a branch?
14,0,1,Huh. Charlie's not chicken, is he?

12,2,0,Not to worry...it's just a presidential candidate looking for a photo-op
18,7,2,yeah, but to win the bet he still has to poop in the barrel
16,11,1,He always said he wanted to play chicken.
11,0,0,Hey, he wants it on HIS terms.

20,14,2,Who taught him how to ride shotgun?
22,7,5,He obviously was the first to call "shotgun."
15,2,1,He thinks the guy is Elmer Fudd.

16,1,2,Let me guess ... It's his first time as a Lookout.
11,0,0,Are you sure that's a Timex?
17,2,1,Ugh. Stoolies!
23,13,5,Not the best lookout we've ever had.
14,1,0,Definitely. The bird bird is much better than the bird dog--looking out for us!
13,0,1,Well two birds in the.bush TRUMPS that.
15,4,1,He's got chutzpah I'll give him that.

25,20,7,It beats working in the mines.
19,2,1,Bird 1: "There goes another gun-toting Trump supporter finally leaving the woods to attend a rally." Bird 2: "And there goes another tree-hugging Sanders supporter catching a free ride."
15,1,0,He is blinded by the camouflage.
20,8,3,Benedict Audubon!
14,6,0,He's always free loading something. That's just the way he is.

13,3,0,What a sight.
13,2,0,Not sure he understands the phrase BIRD's EYE VIEW.
17,2,2,I still think military school was a bad idea
14,2,0,let's fly- that's a stool pidgeon sitting on that gun

23,11,5,If you're not going to tweet about this, I am.
13,1,1,He turned to me and said, "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer," and then just took off!
16,5,1,I think it's known as a peep sight.
19,8,2,I sure hope that counts as 'one in the hand'.
17,4,0,I'm going to need that Branch Analysis Report Jay
11,0,0,Do you think we should call that idiot songbird over here?

16,4,1,Better than working the coal mines.
18,9,3,I always thought our son was a bit of a strange bird.
12,2,0,We call it a Scare Hunter - makes other hunters go away.

28,5,10,He's riding shotgun again!
14,0,1,When he said "you'll have to pry it from my cold dead talons," it was pretty clear he favored the right wing.
29,16,10,I think we can stop worrying about his college fund.
15,2,1,I wonder if passenger pigeons have considered riding in cars, or even taking the train?
33,30,12,She's one of our embedded journalists...

12,3,0,Decoy duty.
12,0,0,I thought he was hunting... what a turn-around.
13,2,0,Is he trying to prove he's better than us?
19,5,3,It’s a cheep shot.
14,2,1,I'd say that's taking the expression "keeping your enemies closer" a little too far.
27,13,7,He only chirps when the guy backs up.
17,4,1,You couldn't pay me to do that.
16,4,1,Guess he missed the whole "bird in the hand" memo.
16,3,1,That was us once--daring young bird brains.
18,4,0,Look, the NFL was right to ban this kind of behavior. It's taunting, plain and simple.
12,0,0,You're the client but, in my opinion, wailing "your time is coming" to the judge is not a winning defense strategy.
28,7,8,I'm pretty sure that's a yellow-bellied ass kisser.
21,12,4,I love deer season.
19,5,3,I told him taking the stock option was risky.
16,5,1,He was let go as canary in a mineshaft.
21,10,5,I told him, "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer."

13,1,0,I guess that's why it's called a 'murder' of crows...
17,6,1,I wish he'd stop saying "some of my best friends are birds" before he fires.
18,6,2,Should we warn him or just tweet about it?
14,3,1,She turned.

19,2,3,Jumping the shark is so last week.
15,3,1,Better take cover, his daily limit is three!

15,4,0,That bird is in the safest place he could be.
18,5,3,When do you think he'll realize the branch is moving?
17,6,2,I know Bob is really a quail... but he sure looks like a sitting duck!
13,1,1,Look Marge, Tweetledumb is hunting for Tweetledee again.
15,4,1,is that a tweet or a retreat?
16,4,1,Legendary last tweet: 'Hey, watch this.'
15,2,1,Is 1 on the gun better than 2 in the bush?
18,7,2,She says that they are just friends!
17,8,0,You know, he's lasted this long, maybe he's onto something. Shall we?
14,5,0,Based on his latest tweet, I think it's time we stop following him.

15,3,1,Polly's decided to seek re-election, I see.
17,3,1,You promised me you were going to review where and where NOT to perch with him over the weekend, Bill!
23,9,5,Is he loaded?
15,3,1,I always knew Tony was a stool pigeon.
11,0,0,Good thing he doesn't have one stone.

14,6,0,Endangered species are such show offs.
20,4,2,He always had a thing for being the bad ass renegade.
15,1,2,I didn't realize the grass was that deep!
12,1,0,Thank goodness a bird on the barrel is worth two in the bush.
