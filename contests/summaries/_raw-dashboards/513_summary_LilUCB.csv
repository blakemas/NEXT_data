3,1,0,Anorexia
3,0,0,The consultants said it would promote teamwork!
5,0,0,Just be glad you only work on the *third* floor!
4,0,0,It sucks we have to share.
3,0,0,I guarantee there's no problem.
5,0,1,Remember, we're all taking equal credit
4,0,0,Allahu akbar, brother. See you in paradise, insha'allah.
3,3,1,My handle is redundant, isn't it?
4,0,0,This bonding program has gone too far;
4,0,0,It is a pleasure and a honor to be a pall bearer of the terrorist rifle.
3,0,0,We've been separated! Why do we still use this conjoined triplets briefcase?
3,0,1,Well , we need a case this size . It's a Trumpet .
3,0,0,This is the casket for the guy in last weeks cartoon.
3,0,0,Snackular Degeration Diet subject line...No looking..
4,0,0,This arrived right after the executive team building workshop.
4,0,0,Like we could ever forget you were winning coxswain at the Head of the Charles?
3,0,0,This falls under my 2nd amendment rights.
2,0,0,We bill by the handle.
2,2,0,The boss wants everything in triplicate!
3,2,1,One of these days, someone is bound to figure out we are playing croquet on the roof during lunch break.
4,0,0,This is what we get for encouraging the boss to attend that "Sharing the Load" seminar.
3,0,0,I got the Trump Special: extra-long roll, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomato and extra mayo. What do you got?
4,0,1,"I still don't know how my transfer is going to work".
3,1,0,I miss the days when our briefcase was short and succinct.
3,0,0,"How many business majors does it take to screw in a light bulb"?
3,1,0,This isn’t what I had in mind when I signed up for job sharing.
4,0,1,HR is trying out a few new ideas around the shared work space concept.
4,0,0,Sorry, but I'm just not that into the whole squad goals thing.
3,0,0,I mean, I know they want us to be more collaborative, but this is ridiculous.
3,0,1,Look, it took Jenkins here, thirty years to get to the front of the bus.
3,0,0,"I think I'm getting too attached to this attache case".
3,0,0,I use this to carry giant squeeze packs of catsup and relish in case one of the IT guys brings another giant wiener for lunch.
3,1,0,So this was the vise president's idea of collaboration!
3,0,0,A traditional coffin might look pretty, but this is so much lighter!
3,0,0,Of course Stanley would have wanted it business as usual.
2,2,0,I love explaining that I can't stay late because I'm case-pooling.
4,0,0,And they said the Xylophone Pro wouldn't have commercial applications!
5,1,0,I heard they fired Ron for not carrying his weight.
3,0,0,Next time, let's set the paper size to "Letter".
3,1,0,Do you think we're taking this car-pooling thing too far?
3,1,0,Unlocking the i-briefcase; this'll be good.
4,0,0,If we put this down she'll ask us to rearrange her office again.
4,0,0,If they catch us climbing the corporate ladder from the top floor we'll be blackballed.
3,1,0,Two's company, what are we?
3,1,0,Three's company, but this is ridiculous.
5,0,0,I hope three on an attache isn't bad luck.
3,1,1,I've always said, 'legal brief' is an oxymoron.
4,0,0,Sharing a desk is OK, but this is ridiculous.
3,0,0,I understand getting rid of offices for cubicles, I even understand a common rest room, but making us share the briefcase seems almost anti-Trump.
3,0,1,Will you please stop humming "We Shall Overcome"
4,2,0,I told you the boss had big plans for us.
3,1,0,We're prepared for a lengthy trial.
4,1,1,Sorry Chad, we're looking for a man with slightly longer arms.
3,0,0,I'm pretty sure Men in Black III doesn't have three agents.
3,0,0,He refuses to take sick days.
2,2,0,You can't stay on that side in the bathroom.
4,0,0,Don't you think these days equal partnership is taken to seriously?
3,0,0,There's collaboration, and then there's codependence.
3,0,0,A tandem bike? Please. I have *some* self-respect.
3,0,0,Cleopatra should help us with this briefcase like she did when we fought Pompey.
3,3,2,I apparently didn’t read the fine print of the RideShare program.
3,0,0,I don't trust you guys, either.
3,0,1,Long-term projections?
3,2,2,I thought legal pads were already too long.
4,0,1,I still think this looks more suspicious.
3,1,0,You're not lifting.
3,1,1,The judge keeps extending the case!
3,0,0,We need to present a unified front.
3,1,0,Can you handle it?
2,2,0,And what did you think job sharing meant?
3,0,0,I thought this was what he meant by a 3D presentation.
3,1,1,These audits are killing me.
6,1,0,This is the longest file we've ever collected for a case.
3,0,0,I'm loving this new Long Vuitton briefcase.
4,0,0,You think they're going to accept our massaging their numbers?
3,0,0,I tired of working on this "Flat Tax" proposal
3,0,0,Do you have to be different in everything
4,0,0,We have long legal briefs.
3,0,0,What happened to Chance.
3,2,1,You are always too far left for us.
3,3,1,Why do they always want small unmarked bills?
5,1,0,Don't you find it strange that we're all wearing the same suit?
3,2,1,You're sure they said actual boiler plate.
3,0,0,They called it a merger;but I never thought they give us one briefcase too work out of.
3,1,0,I hate meetings where they tell us to bring our own stretcher.
4,1,0,Why does he always get the first handle...
2,2,0,I lead but I also follow.
3,0,0,It's the new corporate plan for standardizing sleeve buttons.
4,0,2,First we had to share a cubicle.
3,0,0,I think we need a coxswain.
3,0,0,The judge said he dislikes long briefs.
3,1,0,We're anticipating a long trial.
3,0,0,They didn't have to kill our proposal
2,4,1,We also have to screw in a light bulb today.
3,1,0,When the boss said "Make the staff meeting entertaining", I don't think he meant bring a xylophone.
5,0,0,Personally, I think he's overcompensating for something.
3,0,0,I am not responsible for your being third in line..your responsibilty problem is responsible.
4,0,0,Three-piece suits are "out," but the triple briefcase will always be "in."
3,0,0,Talk about luck...three xylophone players in one office.
3,0,0,I hate being conjoined at the toe.
3,1,0,I told the judge it wouldn't take long and there was only one page of women's signatures, claiming sexual abuse.
5,1,1,What makes you think anyone would sit through a presentation of FOLDING yardsticks?
4,1,0,Sometimes I wonder about this new sharing economy.
3,0,0,I guess I should have told you that the client really prefers left-handed accountants.
3,0,0,Just say we're concealing a weapon.
4,0,0,This man bag will get us tons of chicks.
3,3,1,It's bad enough the company makes us share a room.
3,0,0,We will win this big case!
4,0,0,My wife picked it out!
5,1,0,I hear it contains an alternate ending to "the sopranos"
3,0,0,C'mon Fred, you know the drill. Carry with the left and shake with the right.
3,2,1,I'm getting really sick of this redistribution of wealth...
4,0,1,Let's wait until after the service to see what happened to the other pallbearers.
3,0,0,I don't know why but I just feel like our proposal is going to be dead on arrival.
3,1,0,Do you think we can get this guy through security?
4,1,0,Please tell me this isn't that Thompson guy from accounting the boss canned yesterday.
4,0,0,Apparently, you found the key to the the portable tanning booth!
4,1,0,What if one of us resigns?
3,1,0,Does this remind you of the song about the marching ants?
4,1,0,What did you think "three for the price of one" meant?
4,0,0,Here in Ottawa, we call it the "Hockey Stick" not the "Football".
4,1,1,How else to let her know that the deal is DOA.
2,2,0,Time to admit this is the worst case scenario.
3,1,0,Well why not, we car pool don't we?
5,0,0,Well one of us should have remembered the combination.
3,0,0,Aren't we supposed to bring actual boards to this meeting?
3,1,0,Do you think they'll know we're together?
3,0,0,Yeah, we are Marsellus Wallace's new guys.
3,0,0,We're shaving corners on this year's all staff retreat. Instead of the all-inclusive ski lodge, we're going urban poling around Central Park!
3,0,0,I love bonding exercises, but you said how far?
4,0,0,And if something should happen to him... Bam! We both move up.
3,0,1,This is NOT what I thought he meant when he said he needed his three best litigators to carry an important case for him.
3,0,0,I am pulling my weight
3,1,0,Technically, I'm not lying. I told my wife that the FBI finally has me be working on a really big case.
3,0,0,I hope the concerto for three left hands and a right hand goes well.
3,0,0,At least the boss can't fire us now.
3,1,0,So, we're agreed: One more team building exercise and we're out of here.
3,1,0,I'll be Curly this time.
3,0,1,Time for a 'Diplomatic Selfie'!
4,0,0,I bet they didn't think a white guy could play the koto.
2,2,0,I thought you said this was a BRIEF case.
3,1,0,This must be his briefcase, it's YUGE!
3,0,0,I always deliver my tax return in person.
3,1,0,Don't worry, they won't suspect a thing.
5,1,0,I know we saved on the airport luggage fee but don't you think it's time we each got our own travel bag?
4,0,0,This wasn't my idea of a triumvirate.
4,2,0,I wish they'd finally do away with the extra long form.
4,1,0,Still, let's keep it brief.
3,1,0,Just once can't you side with me on a case?
3,1,1,It's how Frank always wanted to go.
3,0,0,We should have brought the briefcase.
4,1,1,Just follow us.
3,0,0,It's attache-d case.
3,0,0,How long 'till you think ol' Bartleby's gonna start to smell?
3,0,0,According to HR, I only have to carry the middle handle on Tuesdays.
3,0,0,You're the new adjunct attaché?
4,1,1,Okay, this is good. We all have a handle on it now.
4,0,0,I usually open carry but I can't find my keys.
4,0,0,He always wanted to go quietly.
6,1,1,I think today's the day I get promoted to front handle.
3,0,1,We need to make a pit stop.
3,0,0,Seems like the briefs keep getting longer and longer.
3,1,0,I guess I misunderstood the term "Case Managers."
3,0,0,This draft might get through the House, but the Senate will find it too long.
4,2,0,My grandmother had a lot of silverware sets.
3,0,0,You're right, the elevator is faster.
3,0,0,This is the biggest case I've ever worked on
4,1,0,You should have seen the size of his hands...
3,0,0,The swordfish brief
3,0,0,The next time they ask if I'm a team player, I'm saying "No".
3,1,0,Did you bring the presentation?
3,0,0,Anarchist
3,0,0,Mac OS X Python. Too literal?
2,2,0,All through law school I dreamed about my first Big Case.
2,2,0,I think we all have a handle on this now.
4,0,0,We are coming today to bury Flat Stanley.
2,2,0,I had a feeling mandatory carpooling was a slippery slope.
3,0,0,Your display of white short is pretty ostentatious.
3,0,0,You had to be the one to saw the girl in half, you had to be the big shot on this one. Now what are you going to tell her mother, and don't ask about super glue again.
5,1,0,Shh, there's illegal-sized paper inside.
3,0,0,Yes, Jeff, I get it -- you're a manager. But you're not a *middle* manager.
3,1,0,Will your wife notice it's missing?
3,0,0,I guess I'm not quite sold on this Briefcase-B-N-B idea.
3,1,0,This all-in-one technology is getting a bit out of hand
3,0,0,Another proposal that will be dead on arrival.
3,0,0,I take it you clicked the service agreement without reading it, too?
4,2,1,Well, you're taking the middle seat in the plane.
4,0,0,They will agree to settle before we even open it.
3,0,0,Your wife seems happy we're bringing work home.
3,1,0,Twenty-five years to settle the Fender estate.
3,0,0,No, this isn't the mile high club, and I have no desire to fly on your magic carpet.
5,0,0,Common planning time is a pain in the butt.
3,0,0,He's big on mergers.
3,0,0,Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do
3,1,0,They're the XL files.
3,0,0,It was a committee decision.
4,0,0,Dibs on the pudding cup.
3,1,0,When they said we’d get company shares, this isn’t what I had in mind.
3,1,0,Let's eliminate the middleman.
4,1,2,You're right. He does fit.
3,0,0,For a T-Rex, it's awfully light.
3,0,0,Is bigger is better really going to work?
3,1,0,There's nothing brief about this case.
3,0,0,Thank God Ben Carson's back!
3,0,0,Have a good night's sleep last night? I happened to notice you tossing and turning a little.
3,1,0,That's just the way it is, least seniority gets the back handle.
3,0,0,Flat Stanley deserves better
4,0,0,Hoffa
4,1,0,Next time, maybe don't be so quick to volunteer for the big case.
4,1,0,When you suggested a three-way at the office, I had envisioned something a little different.
3,0,0,Don't be the tail wagging the dog!
3,0,0,Two's a company, but three's a crowdsource.
3,0,0,There's no 'I' in 'team'.
3,0,0,I've gotta pee.
3,0,0,Golf clubs, maybe?
3,0,0,It's the "not so brief" case.
4,0,0,The Sharing Economists
3,0,0,Looks like we all have a good handle on the case.
5,0,0,Trust me
3,0,0,I know you called 'shotgun' first. Just not in the elevator!
4,0,0,'Team building's OK, but this is ridiculous.'
3,3,1,I preferred it when we could just fire a guy.
4,1,0,Remember when all we needed was a violin case and a tommy gun?
7,0,0,These are the contracts for our NBA clients.
3,0,0,No, no, no! That's MY exit strategy!
3,3,0,I just don’t think it says “Mad Men” to our clients.
3,0,0,No, that's not the reason your in the back.
4,0,0,you and your bargain attaches...
5,0,0,The boss certainly does a lot of weekend reading.
3,0,0,The 'Yoga for Beginners' class meets down the hall.
6,0,0,This is our last bathroom break before lunch!
5,0,0,If at first you don't succeed, Tri, Tri, Tri again.
3,0,1,It's the terms AND the conditions
3,0,0,Did you ever imagine being a pallbearer for an anorexic friend?
3,0,1,I told you this is the perfect way to steal an ironing board from a hotel.
5,0,0,Undertakers: Beware the Ides of March !! Underpaid doctors can "undertake" new moonlighting jobs ...
2,2,0,Trust me. They do this at Google.
3,0,0,You call it a football?
3,1,0,I'm rethinking the carpool.
4,0,0,The secret is whether this year's company Easter Bunny is dark or milk chocolate
3,1,0,The client prefers everything in triplicate.
3,0,0,I'm feeling it's little more heavy than awkward.
4,1,0,Three men. One briefcase. Who will be next?
3,1,0,In my previous briefcase pool the other guys never pulled their weight.
4,0,0,Let's hope third time's the charm.
3,0,0,I think we should propose a merger of equals
3,0,0,It's the corporate ladder.
3,0,1,You're a righty?!
4,0,0,This is how we smuggle putters into our office.
3,1,0,Why couldn't we just use PowerPoint for this meeting?
4,0,0,Does a promotion mean i ... keep this? Or get rid of it?
3,1,0,You know - maybe three is a crowd, but two couldn't carry this thing, and it's an important presentation.
3,2,2,If anyone asks, we're here for the croquet tournament, okay?
3,1,0,Damn, it's also my day to take the middle urinal
2,2,0,I hate mergers!
6,0,0,I'm sorry, but our ad specified that we are looking for a highbrow right hand man.
3,0,0,I'm trying to disguise my viola as an AK-47.
3,0,0,Dave, I thought that we all agreed to carry the briefcase with our left hand?
4,1,0,Trust me, this is the latest European rage, it'll be bigger than the man-purse or the communal toilet!
4,0,0,With such small hands-- either do this or run for GOP nomination.
4,0,0,I was so alone.
5,0,0,Welcome to the sales team.
3,1,0,I understand that the NRA is having success in lobbying Congress to allow the carrying of illegal weapons.
7,0,0,I still think we would have less conspicuous carrying pistols in shoulder holsters.
4,0,0,Do we make our presentation using Trump's logic or Hillary's principles?
3,0,0,We better have one hell of a Shotgun Clause.
3,1,0,She's probably never seen one that long
2,2,0,It's a bargain compared to the briefcase for two.
3,0,0,So, what's the plan for when those burritos start screamin' at me?
3,1,0,I played bass for 'The Who'.
3,0,0,These streamlined coffins are so easy to carry.
3,1,0,This really stretches the word "brief"
3,0,0,Our inclusive workplace is counter-balanced by our uniforms.
4,0,0,Is there a turnstile?
3,1,0,Your breath mints are rolling.
4,0,0,“When will I get my turn as front man of the sales force?
3,0,0,Everyone just play it cool and we can sneak this surf board down to the beach after our 1 o'clock with finance.
3,0,0,At least we're not carrying a tuba.
3,0,0,legal sized paper...
4,0,1,I think its past time we dissolve our joint venture.
3,0,0,This is carrying job sharing too far.
9,4,1,If he'd file his taxes online we wouldn't have to haul around this long form.
3,0,0,Must you always lean to the left?
3,0,0,This thing is like a nicotine patch for my pall bearing addiction.
5,0,0,It's called "synergy"...
3,0,1,He was great before the promotion, but now he won'the even look me in the eye.
3,0,1,We have to find someone to come up with a 'brief' case.
4,0,0,I never understood how being a team player mean't sharing a suitcase.
3,0,0,This cartoon caption contest is fixed.
3,0,0,In the end he had only budgeted enough for three pall bearers.
4,2,4,Wanna share a cab?
4,0,0,I'm feeling redundant
3,1,0,This is last time I ask the partners for help with my caseload.
4,0,0,You can tell a lot about a person by the questions they don't ask.
4,0,0,I should really be the first named partner at Schwartz Schwartz & Schwartz.
3,0,0,I think our presentation may be a bit long.
3,0,0,Are you also a member of The Anorexic's Pall Bearers Society?
3,0,0,It's quite an honor to be Gumby's pallbearer.
4,0,0,We’re asking the court for a tall order.
4,1,0,"When do I get to be up front'?
5,0,0,No I'm not an origin donor, why do you ask?
5,0,0,They'll never be looking for a body in a body-size suitcase carried by three people.
4,0,0,I never bring a knife to a boardroom fight.
3,2,0,We need a briefer case!
3,1,1,The lawyers of Tusk, Tusk, and Trunk were always easy to spot walking into the office.
4,0,0,This sharing economy has gone too far.
5,0,0,Why didn't you just tell her we're from 'music removals R us', she'd never know...
3,0,0,This attaché sharing thing is in the ozone.
3,0,0,I bought it at a Mafia yard sale, recently.
4,1,0,I heard lay off notices were today.
3,1,0,The big bass trio arrives for their evening gig.
3,0,1,Nothing brief about this case.
3,1,0,Our briefs keep getting longer and longer
3,1,0,Louie, you did bring the shells-- right?
3,0,0,This is their answer for #HitmenSoWhite?
3,0,0,It's the only sure way to keep a crease.
3,0,0,Of course you matter. Look, Johnson will walk first into the next lift, and then you can have the front of the briefcase.
2,2,0,I guess this is okay, but did we have to share that stall?
4,0,0,I swear we didn't mean to seat you in the back.
4,1,0,I was a middle child
3,0,1,What if only one of us gets the job
3,1,1,Three single briefcases weren't in the budget
3,2,0,You've really lightened our caseload.
3,1,0,OK, already, I won't call it a briefcase again!
3,1,0,The board of directors demanded we stop bringing them the short report.
3,1,0,We'll dump him in the river.
4,1,0,This is the left-handed floor.
4,1,0,Just because I'm middle management doesn't mean you can call me "Alice."
3,0,0,Gung-ho
3,2,2,I haven't really been lifting.
3,1,0,It took me three years to get the middle handle.
3,0,0,I've learned that the middle man gets paid for doing nothing.
3,0,1,Is this your first luggage company merger?
3,0,0,We sure got a good deal on this anaconda skin brief case.
3,0,0,I know management wants us to collaborate, but what happens to our March Madness pool?
3,1,0,An MBA is useful, but rowing team experience is essential.
3,1,0,We are working the same case.
3,1,0,Trust me, this proposal is D.O.A.
2,1,0,Turns out not to be a brief case this time.
3,1,0,Simply a way to destinguish associates from partners.
3,0,0,Of course it takes three of us: we all have small hands.
3,0,0,Isn't there an app for file sharing?
2,4,3,I'm just saying, I can see why the 'brief'case is more popular.
4,2,2,...then the bartender asks, 'Why the long case?
3,0,1,Next time, learn to play the flute!
3,0,0,You'll find, at this level, that 'brief ' takes on a whole other meaning.
4,1,1,It looks like I'm helping right? That's the trick to being a middle man.
4,0,0,No, I do not want to get the nine foot sub sandwich again.
3,0,0,I worry the witness's deposition might be too long?
4,2,1,There is no Y in TEAMWORK.
4,0,0,No, you can't be in front. It's a Trump rally.
2,3,0,Even with the three of us flying together, I don't think this will qualify as "carry-on" luggage.
3,0,0,Do you think she could smell what's in the briefcase?
3,0,0,This is what comes from exaggerating.
3,0,0,You know what they say about men with long briefcases----They have long dic-tations.
3,0,0,You can try to fit this thing by your feet at the meeting.
2,2,0,I used to be a fan of job-sharing.
4,1,3,It's a long brief.
3,0,1,I hate it when people walk illegally in the briefcasepooling lane.
3,0,0,Another day at United Pallbearers.
4,0,0,Well I heard that Fred here is retiring, and you're gonna get the middle handle.
4,0,0,We should stick with the original pitch for our shared economy business idea. "Suitcasely" - for men in suites who work in the same office and are in the same meetings all day long.
3,0,0,Don't listen to her, we're a trio not a threesome. I promise.
3,0,1,Now if we can just get out of the lobby we're snowboarding by lunchtime.
3,0,0,Welcome to the Bobsled account.
5,2,0,This isn't what I had in mind when they said that we're merging companies.
3,1,0,Fine next time you can have shotgun
4,0,0,I heard the next move is to make us share a single Netflix queue.
3,1,0,I really appreciated your support in there.
3,2,1,I like to call it a griefcase
2,2,0,This your first really big case?
3,0,0,Because we're a team. That's why!
3,2,0,We're in it for the long haul.
3,0,0,Are you sure Hank done it this way?
3,0,0,So much for the sharing economy.
3,0,0,Of course we’ll have to change the name to Dewey, Cheatem, Howe & Rappaport.
3,1,0,I forgot to cut air holes.
3,1,0,I think the long and short of it is that we lost the case!
3,0,0,They ain't gonna miss him for a couple of hours so as long as we don't do something stupid to bring attention to ourselves.
4,0,0,Do we have to be on the same team again?

3,1,0,He lost a lot of weight.

4,0,0,The next time, remember to buy a ream of 8x10.
3,2,0,How will we know when briefcasepooling has gone viral?
4,0,0,So you're the right-hand man.
3,1,0,It's been a long case.
3,0,0,Now that Mr. Trump is president, it takes 3 of us to carry the nuclear football.
5,0,0,You're not carrying your load.
3,0,0,Yes, I am the middle man and I say we should have gone one floor up.
3,0,0,They won't suspect us, we're not Muslims!
3,1,0,How else would we deliver a giant check?

3,2,0,Yeah, he was run over by a steam roller.
3,0,1,This isn't the threesome I had in mind.
4,1,0,Okay, let's try to get a rhythm going otherwise we'll look suspicious.
3,1,0,This way we can honestly say we have three lawyers handling the same case, thus more money for the firm.
3,0,1,That steamroller sure made pall bearing easier!
3,0,0,This sharing society thing has gone too far!
5,0,0,You farted in the elevator, didn't you?
4,0,0,If I were you I wouldn't expect any big vertical moves.
4,0,0,I'm used to being in the middle. I was a middle child.

4,0,0,Trump illegal?
3,1,0,I have a feeling this case will be anything but brief.
6,0,0,Did you remember the key?
3,1,0,The board wants to bury this deal.
2,2,0,This isn't about taking sides.
3,1,0,I can't believe we got Johnson to fit in this but, trust me, the 'businessman jumping out of a briefcase routine' is a crowd pleaser.
3,0,0,You left-leaning Liberals give me a pain.
3,0,0,No. Calendaring the team transport agenda is the hardest part of the Bassoon.
3,0,0,No, this doesn't mean we'll be sharing briefs later.
3,0,0,This is taking job sharing too far!
3,0,0,I always thought 'the long arm of the law' was just a figure of speech.
3,0,0,This deal's gonna be yuuuge!
3,1,0,Enough with the middle man jokes already!
3,1,1,Even split three ways, this is a very big case.
5,2,0,The irony of calling this a 'brief' is getting out of hand.
3,1,0,who's this guy in front of us?
3,1,0,The truth is, 1/3 the pay is still a lot...
3,0,0,Just use "joint" in the presentation.
4,0,0,Jobsharing
3,0,1,"If the case is brief, there's no relief." Johnny Cochran taught me that.
3,0,0,Call me a skeptic, but I'm still not sold on this whole sharing economy thing.
3,0,0,Linda over there keeps complaining about how she makes 25% less than us.
6,0,0,We forgot the lunch box again.

3,0,0,Blah blah blah
3,0,0,It's our latest smartphone.
5,0,0,This company is compatible with our vision.
3,0,0,I hate it when these briefs are lengthy.
5,0,0,I thought we discussed this already. Our next sick day is November 13, 2019.
3,0,0,I thought they called them briefs for a reason.
6,0,0,I know this firm is known for extra-long briefs ... but this is ridiculous!
2,2,0,The client insists on teamwork
4,0,0,I'm feeling it too. This is the new power brief case!
3,0,1,You could say we're joined at the briefs
3,0,0,Your place or mine?
5,0,0,Hey, I'm thrilled the company is doing so well. But upsizing has its limits.
3,1,0,Follow me; I lead from the middle.
3,0,0,Thanks for helping us this far, we can get it from here. It's just some of those little yellow statuette things, nothing special. Have fun watching the show.
3,0,0,Next time we pay for the real Outward Bound team building adventure!
5,0,0,why are you being so distant?
3,1,0,They said I was joining a team with upward mobility.
3,0,0,I hope they're not expecting a short brief.
2,2,0,You're not pulling your weight around here.
3,1,0,What do you think he means by 'triangulated' sales?
4,0,0,This is a very big case
3,0,0,We're just taking the "three men in a room" concept to its logical conclusion.
4,1,0,On the other hand, I really think we should have separate toilets.
3,0,0,Everyone is going to think this ramrod is a briefcase.
4,1,0,Our Company is certainly big enough to afford a permanent conference table.
3,1,0,What do you think of our new HOV elevator?
6,0,0,I'm glad we didn't choose the four-handle briefcase.
4,0,0,If we can sell square bowling balls, we can sell anything.
3,2,1,Could you please stop horsing around Milton and get on the right side. You're missing the whole point of the team building exercise.
3,0,1,I thought we each had our own when we got on the elevator.
4,1,0,This 'sharing economy' thing is getting ridiculous.
2,2,0,How much more can we merge?
6,1,0,The "shareconomy's" next big star: BRIEFER
4,1,0,I definitely prefer acquisitions to mergers.
2,2,0,Look. Some briefs are long. Don't worry about it.
3,0,0,I think this teamwork thing has run its course
4,0,0,The last remains of traceability in default swaps.
3,0,0,They salesman said there is no such thing as a 'briefer' case.
3,0,0,Did you forget to bring our umbrella again?
2,3,0,Chill. There is no "I" in attache case.
4,0,0,As go the briefs, so go the cases.
3,0,0,Is it me or do you feel like a pallbearer for this presentation?
4,1,1,Every merger has its inconveniences.
3,0,0,Now are you convinced Trump is a liar? 'Small hands, big package.'
3,1,0,And briefcasepooling saves on what now?
4,1,0,Harvey, this is the last time I'm going to tell you. This case is for briefs, not long johns!
3,0,0,We'll need a fourth partition once Jimmy signs the new lease.
3,0,0,Looks like another failed urinal presentation.
3,2,1,I look forward to the day when all of us can be on the same side of a case.
3,0,0,The embalming rotation is breeze.
3,0,0,Welcome to the major case team
2,2,0,And you thought this would be a brief case?
3,1,1,Tell Mr Trump his prosthesis body part has arrived.
4,3,1,I told you we can handle this case.
2,5,0,Did you see the size of that lady's purse?
3,1,1,If anyone asks, just say it's a long story.
3,0,0,Did you remember to bring the ammo?
3,0,0,He looked fine yesterday.......
3,1,1,I really thought I was going to get the lead on this case.
3,0,0,Remember, the trick is to act invisible.
3,0,0,Act like you belong ...
3,0,0,A new bromance has formed.
3,1,0,He was wrong about being carried out of here in a pine box
3,0,0,Do you realize this is the first time that the captain put us all on the same case?
3,0,1,No one said I'd be apprenticing as a hit man
4,0,0,I thought it was rude how you called me a "stonehenge looking motherf*cker" in front of that lady. Actually, it was rude in general.
5,2,1,Do you think the humans noticed our briefcase was a bit off?
3,0,0,It's a solid value.
4,0,0,They said it was a three man job
4,0,0,Three Surfboards in one carry-on. Good idea Mingo.
3,0,0,Now remember, if anyone asks, our firm has been handling class action lawsuits for years.
3,1,0,Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to merge our companies.
3,0,0,Well, I guess this is better than trust falls and ropes courses for team building.
3,0,0,I don't like this cheap airfare practice of having to deliver the luggage of others. Especially with the random assignment of passengers to help with the delivery.
3,0,0,New office stationery policy....we write on scrolls.
3,1,0,This job sharing isn’t what I thought.
3,0,1,Just be grateful they removed the handcuffs.
3,1,1,It's not the size of the briefcase that matters . . . it's how many people it takes to carry it.
3,0,0,It's rumored to be the longest tapeworm ever removed from a human being.
3,0,0,I'm booked full this afternoon. Hope it's a short eulogy.
3,0,0,A word of advice Evans, you don't want to do anything here that makes you stand out.
3,0,0,You do realize that this is probably the longest legal brief of all times "You must realize that we may be carrying the longest legal brief of all times!
3,0,0,Because I'm a middle child.
5,1,0,I'm not sure about Dropbox getting into hardware either.
4,1,0,What time are we taking our bathroom break?
3,0,0,Think of us as The Three Litigateers.

3,1,0,There's nothing brief about it
5,0,0,Donald's toupees have never been better protected.
3,0,0,Sadly that presentation died, but it will live on in all of us.

3,0,0,Can't be too rich either
3,1,1,We forgot the myrrh.
3,0,1,It's never too lively at the Pallbearer's Convention

3,0,0,I didn't know "killer presentation'' meant THAT!
3,1,0,She stared because you're on the wrong side.
3,1,0,Talk about falling flat on your face!
3,1,0,It might improve teamwork if we also share a bed.
4,0,2,Great foresight with the briefcase. I don't know how else we could've dealt with the groom's cold feet.
3,1,0,Small hands? Large briefcase.
3,1,0,Get ready, this is gonna be a long case!
3,0,0,Sure, we can leave him holding the bag. But my conscience will trouble me for a long long time.

2,0,0,You don't see our side of the case, do you?
4,0,0,I told you, elevator pitches are hard.
3,0,0,You think the prosecution is prepared for a lengthy case?
3,1,0,Next time, I get to ride in the suitcase.
3,0,0,Don't worry..It's not like the time we brought the inflatable T-Rex to the meeting.
4,1,2,I told you this litigation case was huge.
3,1,1,Trust me - this is how we landed the Costco account.
3,0,0,Hey... Group project means "Group Project"!
3,3,1,You know, I think I'm getting a handle on middle management.
2,2,0,Just follow our lead.
5,0,0,I guess obesity took its toll on the poor dachshund.
2,2,0,As a cost saving measure, we're now considered one full-time employee.
5,1,0,The court is expecting briefs. Wait 'til they see our long-johns.
3,1,0,Did you remember to bring the extra-long paper clips?
4,0,0,Today we're demonstrating the latest model RKC - Road Kill Carrier.
3,0,0,Can we call it the not-so-briefcase?
3,0,0,Setting up across from that collapsed building should net us beaucoup lawsuits.
2,2,0,Remember: Let's be brief.
3,0,0,"Remember when we thought hot-desking was tough".
4,0,0,It's been a very long case.
5,0,0,When they said we had a big case to handle, I didn't it was an eight string sitar.
3,1,0,This isn't even our biggest case this week.
2,2,0,I'm worried there's been talk of cutting out the middleman
3,1,0,Our legal briefs are longer than usual.
3,0,1,Light as a feather...stiff as a board.
3,0,1,If you ask me, this is a conspicuously large payoff.
3,0,0,Tragedy about the steamroller but Joe sure made it easy to be his pallbearer.

4,0,2,I really think Arthur Miller would appreciate our adaptation.
3,0,0,There!s no easy way to carry your light saber.
3,0,0,Personally I don't see any redundancies here do you?
3,0,0,This is just her carry-on.
4,0,1,So how does this work with carry-on?
3,0,0,I hope the trombone concerto sealed the deal
4,0,0,We didn't fold it, I can't say if it is bent or mutilated.
2,2,0,You're sure this doesn't look suspicious?
3,1,1,This time, let me do the reveal. You and Frank try and act surprised.
3,1,0,No more Team-Building Retreats for me!
3,0,0,Don't drop it. This is the biggest case the Firm has had in years.
3,1,0,I still haven't gotten used to the merger.

3,2,0,Larry did you forget to poke holes?
6,0,0,His gloves aren't small.

2,0,0,Now do you grasp what the PM meant by 'three ministers with portfolio'?
3,0,0,'Okay, three-briefing we go! if you're sure they didn't say 'de-briefing...'"
3,1,0,The judge expects it to be a long brief today.
3,0,0,We said three-briefing, Myles, not de-briefing.
4,0,0,What happens in the office stays in the office.
3,1,1,It's gonna be a long meeting.
5,0,1,At least we can take the HOV elevator now.
3,0,0,I don't know what's inside, anymore than you do....
4,0,0,No matter how many samples they take, it still comes back with more Prozac than Cymbalta.
3,0,0,Never thought I'd be a Les Paul bearer at this age.

4,0,0,do you know whats in here?
4,0,2,I call shotgun
3,0,1,Just try to act like this is completely normal.
3,1,1,I didn't think this is what you meant by file sharing...
3,0,0,It's just, 'jumbo brief,' reminds me of George Carlin.
3,0,0,Just keep your gym shorts outta my lunch.
3,0,0,Can't wait for this executive training to be over and we get our own briefcases.
3,1,0,I don't think this is how file sharing works.
4,0,0,I miss the old days when we carried bodies in a duffel bag.
3,0,0,Do you think she noticed how big our briefcase is?
4,0,0,It didn't work for the Romans either.
3,2,0,Someday you'll be Handle One.
5,0,0,Please stop calling me Lucky Pierre.
4,3,0,We carpool, we merged briefcases and you're still not sharing your feelings. Damn it Fred, let me in.

3,0,0,All for one and one for all.
3,0,0,Yes, you're right, the handcuffs would have been totally overdressed.
3,0,0,I think we've found the limits of the sharing economy.
3,0,0,It's an extra large table so we can massage Mr. Trump's ego.
5,0,0,Just as safe as Hillary's server
4,1,0,I thought for sure Cuban would have invested 200 grand for a 25 percent stake.
6,3,0,Separate, yes; but equal
3,0,1,First time pallbearing for roadkill?
4,0,0,Why, oh, why do they call them briefs?
3,1,0,How else would you compensate for these small hands, Smith?
3,0,0,It's a really long-term deal.

3,2,1,Big case today.
3,1,0,We don't call it a threesome in front of clients.
4,1,1,So, tomorrow am I driving?
3,0,0,Maybe it makes our hands look small, but it definitely makes our briefs look better.

3,1,0,When you said merger, this is not what I had in mind
3,2,0,I think we should have left it at car pooling.
3,0,0,Why is she looking at us in such a strange way?

5,1,0,This car pooling thing is getting out of hand.
3,0,0,Whose idea was it to take car-pooling to the next level?
3,0,0,Kind of ironic that the boss still calls this a "brief"-case.
3,0,0,This is actually the work of six.
2,2,0,This is the result of the emphasis placed on sharing in elementary school.
3,0,0,It's just as Vita requested . I stuffed her pockets full of rocks and now we're going to drop her and the cats in the East River.
3,0,0,Our job-sharing arrangement has officially become weird.
3,0,0,We know you're not doing the heavy lifting around here.
2,2,0,We should all be on the same side.
3,0,0,You've got to start pulling your weight around here, Jenkins.
2,2,0,Remember, act like we're not ready to buy!

4,0,0,Why are we carrying left-handed and you're not? Could it be your religion?
3,0,0,I don't know, Barry. What if we never meet three fraternal triplet sisters carrying a tri-purse? Maybe that stuff only happens in the movies.
3,0,0,"I" know we are triplets, and "I" know your triplet briefcase is a great idea, but trust me on this, the only chance we have to impress those "Jump the Shark" entrepreneurs is to walk in unison on the same side.

3,1,0,This is definitely not a brief case.
3,1,0,Your lunch is weighing me down.
2,2,0,Remind me to demand the other side pays for copying costs.

6,0,0,It's the Donald Trump model.
6,0,0,I do believe we're onto something with this accelerated, on-the-spot, three-on-one, good-guy-bad-guy, captive elevator approach!

3,0,0,What are you looking at? You've never seen a man with a briefcase?
3,2,0,Be prepared. The middle man is about to leave.
4,0,0,I'll be so glad when the jury comes back on this nasty faulty ironing board liability case!
3,0,0,I think I'm going to invest in my own suitcase from now on instead of share one with the both of you.
2,0,0,Bet it was hard for her not to ask us what this is.
2,2,0,This is why we call it "a Board Meeting."
3,0,0,I think people are starting to get the wrong idea.
2,3,0,I'm having second thoughts about the sharing economy.
3,0,0,- I told ya! You don’t need to merge briefcases when merging companies!

4,0,0,I'm an equal opportunity bagman.
3,1,0,Remember, you're the back-up to the back-up.
4,0,0,Maybe 'teamwork makes the dream work', but taking that cab ride here would have been a lot easier on my own.
4,1,1,Welcome aboard! The company says all of this promotes teamwork, but revolving doors are still a real hot button issue with HR.
4,0,0,I thought that went well except for the "casket of the future" crack.
5,0,0,this is the last time we're filing and wearing the same suits.
3,0,0,The boss got this "team" idea while attending a funeral.
3,1,1,First time with a big case?
3,0,0,He has the heavy end.
4,3,2,If anyone asks, you packed your own suitcase.
5,0,0,How are 3 of us going to play this guitar
3,0,0,Matching pocket squares in teal would really draw some attention away from this three handle briefcase
3,3,0,I get the carpooling, but remind me how this is better for the environment again?

5,3,0,You may have Tom fooled but you and I both know you're not carrying your weight.
6,1,1,I'm a team player, but I'd still prefer separate office chairs.
3,0,0,Do you know whats in this case? Your looking very shady today.

3,1,0,We've got a long case ahead of us.
3,1,0,Most power trios only have one guitar, but this is ridiculous.

3,0,0,Our Law Office has given Togetherness a whole new meaning
3,0,0,Because nobody wants to be left holding it.
3,0,0,These contracts are getting way too long.
3,0,0,It's suppose to "amplify" our "ecosystem".
5,0,0,We really got a handle on this case don't you think.
3,1,0,They're nerds like us. We pitch them that size does matter. 'The XXXLphone - chick magnet. So big it takes three men to carry.' What do you think?

3,0,0,He told us he wanted to be buried just in case.

4,0,0,Where are the other 3 guys?
2,2,0,You know what they say about small hands... a big package.
3,0,0,EVER WONDER WHAT THEY ARE PAYING US FOR?
7,1,0,The mortician said I was crazy, but the carpool lane changes everything.
4,0,0,I'm starting to think our life insurance pitch may be in bad taste.

3,0,0,We're holding it together, aren't we?
3,1,0,They said that I would never be a team player. What do you think?

2,2,0,Just to be clear, the 'long form' was not my idea.

3,0,0,You didn't ask what they meant by "teamwork is our central value"?
3,1,0,Why are you always on fhe wrong side?
6,0,0,I'd help fellas, but I only make 79% of what you do so you should be able to handle it.

3,1,0,Did you hear that?
3,0,0,A team effort! It's a team effort. That's all I friggin hear.
3,0,0,How can we be sinister if you walk on the right side?
1,6,0,If our seats are three across, we should be able to get some work done on the flight.
3,0,0,... and that, my friend, is what you do when they face the wrong direction!
6,2,0,This is a two man job, new guy. Watch your back.
3,1,0,Just to warn you, our Board can be very literal.

2,2,0,We can handle this case together.
4,0,0,I guess this can't be considered a 'briefcase' technically.
6,1,1,Wait till you see our men's room.
2,2,0,It's more of an attaché case.
3,1,0,Remember its your turn this time to request it as a carry-on.
3,4,2,Try to remember to say 'xylophone', not 'secret nuclear device'.
3,2,0,This is the only threesome us charted accoutants will ever get.
3,0,0,I told her it's the iphone7+++
5,0,0,You really took the think outside the box suggestion to heart, huh?
3,0,0,Glad you could join the firm. We needed a third hand,
3,1,0,All he said was the case came with two paralegals.
3,0,0,I love being your kid to work day.
5,0,0,“Today are we Stooges, Bears, or Musketeers?
4,2,0,Welcome to the mergers and acquisition team!
3,1,0,How did your interview go?
3,0,0,Perhaps we're taking this UberPool thing too far
3,0,0,We were in a band together. How did you know him?
3,0,0,Can you believe management is hiring consultants to help get rid of "redundancies"? What a waste of money.
5,1,0,You have the left's perspective on some big issues.
2,2,0,Fine. Next week, YOU'RE the middleman.
7,1,0,I still say 3 brief cases would have been better than 1 lengthy case.
3,1,0,I prefer middle handle on the tandem briefcase.
3,0,0,It took me awhile but I came around on the concept of car pooling , but this is going too far.
4,1,0,I'm finally getting the hang of this group briefing thing.
3,0,0,I am the next coming of Christ.
3,0,0,I'm so already over the sharing economy.
3,0,0,How was I supposed to know they didn't like electric guitars?
4,0,0,To be honest, Reginald, I just don't know if this "not-so-brief case" was such a good idea.
6,0,0,Let's try rolling the scroll next time.
3,0,0,This is not the 'brief threesome' that I thought it was.
3,0,0,Is it me, or do these payments keep getting bigger?
4,0,0,This doesn't work correctly when you're on the opposite side, Brian!
3,0,0,You can only Paleo so long!
4,0,0,How do you always keep your end up?
4,0,0,At our law firm we only use 8-1/2" by 70" extralegal paper.
4,0,0,We'll call it the not so briefcase.
3,0,0,It's not just me, right? This briefcase is crazy long, no?
4,0,0,I know I said, "Let's lay that idea to rest." But come on!

4,0,0,I hadn't anticipated having to make room for a fourth person in there.
3,0,0,This business 3-way is no fun!

2,2,0,Remember, this is my lunch.
2,2,0,For the record, I hate our new business cards.
3,1,0,This A4 paper is bull@%#*!

2,3,0,Next year we file the short tax form.
2,2,0,This is the longest case we've ever worked on.
6,0,0,We're carrying the donuts for the meeting.

3,0,0,The rifle case lets them know that we mean business.
6,1,0,Let go now , before they take your tan .
4,0,0,Why am I always in the middle?
3,0,0,If we are caught claim you don't know me.
3,0,0,Remember, we shake hands at the same time too.
4,0,0,If a diamond-encrusted yardstick doesn’t impress them, nothing will.
3,1,1,This won't fit under the seat.

3,1,0,Okay, you can have the middle position on the way out.
4,0,0,Luigi, why do you always have to be right!!
2,2,0,Do you remember the procedure for when I need to switch hands?
3,2,0,Nuclear codes, no, this is the president's basketball bracket.
3,0,0,I have an idea... Rather than sharing this lengthy case, we could each carry a brief case.
3,2,1,How long did you know Gumby?
3,1,1,Is this your first big case?
3,1,0,There are rumors of everyone getting their own when the market rebounds.
4,0,0,Did you notice that tiny purse?
3,0,1,Downsize THIS.
3,1,0,Someone heard attache case.
2,2,0,Taxis, revolving doors -- they're all bad for mergers.
3,0,0,I think we've got a handle on this.
6,0,0,Wait...I can't remember if we put the lock on the bike...
3,0,0,Does everything have to be "why's the brown guy at the back?"

6,2,0,In this case it's all about bonding.
4,0,0,It's either Trump's hair, or the wall. We haven't quite figured it out yet
3,0,0,Did you see the memo on sorority racism?
4,0,0,Wait a minute! Weren't we supposed to leave him at the cemetery before coming back for the after-party?
3,0,0,I'll take it odd days; you two split the rest.

3,1,1,This meeting could go a little long.
2,3,0,This time, you have got to hold up your end.
3,0,0,I really feel the synergy.

2,3,0,On this case you're co-co-counsel.
2,6,2,Must you always take the opposing side of every case?
3,0,0,This doesn't look suspicious at all. I told you we should have taken the stairs. Where do you bury bad bosses anyway?

3,0,0,Oh but you should see the size of the prosecutor!
3,0,0,If we make Shapiro partner does that mean we're going to have to get a bigger briefcase?

3,1,0,xylophone...why do you ask?
3,0,0,We're more left than you are even though we're on the right side.

5,0,0,There's nothing brief about it, Phil.
6,0,0,Has it occurred to you that I'm always in the middle?
3,0,0,Lucky for us the six-foot hero comes with a carrying case.
4,0,0,Don't you think we've carried this "Do you know we are triplets ," thing far enough?
3,0,1,This is not exactly what I meant when I said we should handle this together.
4,1,0,You said you wanted to include the longitudinal study
6,0,0,He said put the money in the suitcase so we had to have it custom made
3,0,0,The boss said we could make a case for bringing our kids to work.
4,0,0,this must be a really,really big brief

3,0,0,Well, you should have thought of the revolving doors when you came up with "briefcase-pooling", Bob.
3,0,0,Thanks for the help. You have to watch that auto correct. There's a big difference between attaché and attach.
3,0,1,How long have you been working for the Department of Redundancy Department?
3,0,0,This new Android design is going to be huge.
3,1,0,i hope you can hold up your end of this bargain.

3,1,0,We really need to get in the same carpool.
3,1,1,Think we'll be noticed?
3,1,0,R&D had a heck of a time getting this down to three handles.
3,0,0,We thought YOU were carrying the rest of the instruments.
4,0,0,Since it didn't fit in the elevator, I guess we'll have to take the stairs to the 97th floor.
2,2,0,Yeah, full of layoff notices, but one handle is fake so that none of us can know for sure who delivered them to HR.

3,0,0,The big warheads require three buttons.
3,1,0,Welcome to the sharing economy.
4,0,2,Did you really think this would work as a carry-on?

3,0,0,Are you sure this is what the consultant meant by team synergy?
3,0,0,No strings attached!
3,0,0,We may have to screw in a lightbulb as well.
3,0,0,If this goes sideways on us you can’t just drop your corner like it wasn’t your idea too.
3,1,0,This team work stuff is getting out of hand.
3,1,1,What else are you going to do with a dead business model?
3,1,0,Not so sure how crazy I am about this new "sharing" economy.
3,0,0,I'm think of buying new underwear. Are you in?
3,0,0,Do we fill out each other's evaluation, too?
3,1,0,That's two down to one up!
3,0,0,I guess we're having another sleepover.
2,2,0,This must be the longest report they've ever put together.
3,0,0,I always thought you were also left handed

4,0,0,I don't care what Shark Tank thinks -- I say America IS ready for a lifesized Trump cookie.

3,0,0,Just follow my lead, and will land this gig.
3,0,0,Just wait until you see the executive washroom.
3,0,0,Regardless whether the FIFO or LIFO rule applies in this instance, I still remain a ‘shmucko.’

2,2,0,Next time, let's demonstrate teamwork on the cloud.
3,2,0,We should have stopped at ride-sharing.
2,2,0,Hansen has the ball, and Shortz has the paddles!
2,2,0,Geez, Talk About a Merger...

3,0,0,Remember to shoot first, talk later.
3,0,0,I was working as a butcher before I became a magician.

3,1,0,This being triplets thing is getting old!
3,1,1,On the other hand, our billable hours have tripled.
3,0,0,So, what's in your suitcase?
2,2,0,Why shouldn't it be you at the back of the briefcase?
3,0,0,I get the need for cost-cutting, but this is going a bit far.
2,2,0,You're right. The HOV elevator is faster.
5,1,0,This meeting should put an end to the "Where's Hoffa?" question.
4,1,0,Don't worry-it is our second amendment right
4,0,0,Briefing papers
4,1,0,The next time they send us to a board meeting we need to check on how long the board is.
3,4,2,I started off where you are. And look at me now!

5,2,1,It's a partial list of next years African American Oscar nominees.

5,0,0,Man, why even bother?
3,1,0,Checked or Carry-on?
3,1,0,When they ask if we want to extend our presentation, we will be prepared.
3,1,0,You just have to draw attention to yourself, don’t you?
3,1,1,Yeah well being in the middle there's not much glamour either.
3,1,0,Don't forget- we don't yell Happy Birthday until she jumps out.
3,0,0,Such a long time since we had a brokered presentation.
3,0,0,Sure it works. The trick is to convince them it's pocket-sized.
2,2,0,Why was she staring at us?
4,1,0,I told you, we should've just done a power point presentation.
4,0,0,Our shared hot desk is down this way.
3,0,0,Do you think Project Amistad will be the ending soon?

3,0,0,I'm glad we packed our lunches.
4,0,1,I'm firing our efficiency expert.
3,0,0,I'm not saying I wouldn't vote for Romney. I just want him to decide before we have to bring up another damn binder.
4,1,0,Mini hands make light work...
3,1,1,Act natural.
3,0,0,Why do you think they know we're The Three Musketeers?
3,0,0,Should we share a cab?
4,0,0,I'm not sure if our CEO truly understands thr concept of sharing resources.
3,0,0,I told you not to mention his tiny fingers.
3,2,2,I hear they want hire one person to replace us.
3,0,0,I'm tired of retorting, "Yes, in fact, our briefs are long."
5,2,0,There is no "i" in bref.
4,0,1,I know the boss wants synergy, but come on...
3,1,1,This new teamwork initiative has gone to far.
5,0,0,His presentation fell a little flat.
3,0,0,I told you this "group work" would be a great idea, now we have other people to blame if there's a mess up.
3,1,0,Mergers are not for everybody.
3,0,0,Boy, if she only knew we are "Super Glued" to these handles!
3,1,0,A briefcase on wheels? That would look weird.
3,0,0,Make no small plans.
3,0,0,How did you get him in there?
4,1,0,We're really taking this merger seriously, huh?
3,0,0,Because CPA's don't have roadies, thats why
3,1,0,When we bring in the "Big Guns" everybody's always surprised they're in a big case.
3,0,0,Briefcase, schmeef-case
4,0,0,Jerry, if you're going to complain, you shouldn't have opted for the '33 cents on the dollar' downsizing package.
4,0,0,Hey, Mac, this long, oblong box is heavy ! We're C.I.A. case officers, supposedly on a routine courier run? What's in the box: a body? I mean, is the Company delivering like U.P.S. now, as mortuary pall-bearers C.O.D.?
2,2,0,I'm pretty sure the boss didn't mean this when he ordered the expansion of our portfolio.
4,0,0,She was totally checking out the 'threefcase'.
3,1,0,We need somebody more flat-chested than her.
3,1,0,At the last place I worked we just voted the CEO out.
4,0,2,Remember, say we forgot the key. I'm betting your ventriloquism will be a killer ice breaker.
4,0,0,I still think the brief for this case is a little wordy.
3,2,0,Quit complaining. The hips are always the heaviest.
3,0,0,Threesomes are all the rage now.
4,0,0,These team building exercises are getting awkward.
3,0,0,Who but Trump would order 'designer' concrete samples? But I guess since someone else is paying for the wall….why not?

3,0,0,Gun control.
3,0,0,Quick! To the tandem Gocycle!
3,0,0,I hate this new IRS Long Form.
5,0,0," It's just cumbersome".
3,2,2,This would be a lot easier if we all worked on the same floor.
3,0,0,The case load's the same but now we can triple bill.
3,0,0,Why do we always ask for treble damages?
3,0,0,At our next meeting, I get to be coxswain.
3,0,0,We can't let her go without her trombone.
4,0,0,The Democratic Socialist administration has really changed Wall Street.
4,0,0,Saimese lawyers
3,0,0,Todd wanted to let you know, he left a nice layer of palm sweat on that handle for you.
6,0,1,He groaned at the CEO's jokes.
3,0,0,How would you claim a tax loss carry-forward?
4,0,0,Of course it is huge. Ya think Donald would want a brief case?
4,0,2,Did you use the "size of your briefcase" line again?
3,0,0,We bill in triplicate.
4,1,1,I hear you can pay extra during peak hours to ride solo
3,0,0,I told you the suits were a bad idea
3,0,0,Next we discuss collateral damage.
3,0,0,Your just wrong if your not on the right.
3,0,0,Our reading of the constitution is especially rigid.
3,1,0,All this technology and we still have to do everything in triplicate.
3,0,0,Of course the drummer is conservative.
3,0,0,Quit complaining! You sat shotgun in the carpool!
2,0,0,Well, it's lighter than a coffin.
3,1,0,Do you think the jury will realize this is a really big case we are trying?
3,0,0,This is one of his lengthier briefs.
4,1,0,In this case size matter's.
3,2,1,First it was three to a cubicle
3,1,0,Most people don't realize it's congenital.
5,1,0,I'm a little worried that the firm is in financial trouble since they can't afford to buy us individual briefcases.
3,0,0,Oh, so you're a conservative?
2,0,0,You need a yoga mat not a flying carpet.
3,1,1,Yup, flat as a pancake.
2,2,0,At least they finally moved our offices to be on the same floor.
4,1,0,Just between you and me, I’m not completely sure a suitcase full of old bricks is the Next Big Thing.
3,2,2,If you stand on this side, we'll just look silly.
2,3,0,Yes, you go wide at corners.
5,2,0,Clarinet trio
3,2,1,Straighten your tie, Tommy. It's causing people to stare at us.
3,0,0,Let me do the talking...we don't want to appear weird if we all talked at once
3,0,0,Poor Stanley, suffocated in an envelope.
2,2,0,You're just not middle management material.
5,0,0,What you looking at?
3,0,0,I wish I could see the look on his face when he can't find the body.
3,0,1,On April 15 I use the long form.
3,1,0,Boxers or briefs...and you just had to say boxers!
3,0,0,Yeah, maybe the open office has gone too far.
3,1,0,I'm not sure that I like the new job sharing program.
4,1,0,I get those middleman comments all the time.
3,1,0,I'm the one doing the heavy lifting
3,0,0,I think we've taken car pooling a little too far.
3,2,0,The case was tricky, but the whole firm had a handle on it.
6,1,0,And how, exactly, do you plan to shake hands with the client from that side?
4,0,0,Yes, you're correct, it was less expensive than three individual brief cases. But I'm not convinced of its practicality.
4,0,1,This’ll make it easier to massage the numbers.
3,1,0,If you ask me, this is carrying teamwork a little too far.
4,0,2,So, how exactly does brief case-pooling help the environment again?
3,1,0,I hate being in the middle, I hate that we all dress alike, and I hate that you’re always on the other side. Other than that I think we make a great team.
3,0,0,Maybe we're taking this "Sharing Society" a little too far.
3,1,0,Just be thankful we don't make pool tables.
3,1,0,The boss will be impressed with our new meaning of "teamwork".
3,0,1,Hey stop complaining. I NEVER get the window or the aisle seat.
3,0,0,If your peanut butter & jelly sandwich stinks up my audit report he'll ruin you.
2,2,0,Work hard and one day you'll get to the middle.
3,1,0,My new phone has the biggest screen ever and a three man carry case to go with it. Its like having a tv in the palm of your hand.
2,2,0,I miss moving bodies for disorganized crime.
3,0,0,We couldn't have chosen a *brief*case?
3,1,0,Did you see her face when I said 'let's get horizontal?'
3,0,0,When I said "Back to the drawing board," I didn't mean it literally.
3,2,1,Somehow, I never envisioned myself as part of a lawyer three pack from Costco.
3,0,0,This is what happens when you let the sales department decide how we do file sharing.
3,1,0,Death by steamroller.
3,0,0,The folks up at sales will just have to acknowledge the Return of Low Tech.
3,0,0,I KNOW it's your first day, but try to keep up.
2,2,0,Security only spot-checks, so just act natural.
3,0,0,This partnership thing is over done.
6,0,1,It's just like a merger.
3,0,0,I believe in teamwork, but this is carrying it a little too far.
3,1,0,Our paperless office program has a long way to go.
3,2,1,Isn't it ironic that they're still called briefs?
3,0,0,Nobody here handles the big cases by themselves.
4,0,0,It's a very big case.
3,0,0,Maybe if you worked a little harder you'd be middle handle material.
3,4,2,Share a cab?
3,1,0,I think we've got a handle on this case.
5,0,0,So which one of us gets to play tonight?
3,0,0,Well that idea went over like a lead bassoon.
3,0,0,...remember, Bob's gonna say, "But these chopsticks are too short!," and that's when you start the Coldplay song.
3,1,0,Not the brief case we had hoped for.
3,0,0,New deal at the office, "Buy one get two free!"
4,0,2,Carpooling is one one thing, but this is ridiculous!

3,1,0,I hope this doesn't mean I get the middle seat.
3,0,0,Suitcase: A Journey.
3,0,0,How are you liking the shared workspace?
4,0,0,We need to take our case to a higher court.
4,0,0,I think this is your handle.
3,0,0,Because his will specified the mail delivery tube, but he wouldn't fit
2,2,0,Your turn in front will come when we walk back.
2,0,0,I understand you name is Trey.
2,3,0,You seem out of step with our corporate culture.
4,0,0,Perhaps it would be better for the team if we each had our own briefcase.
4,1,1,Congrats, guys. We are now too big to fail.
3,1,0,Did you notice anything odd about her?
3,0,0,I never thought being a pallbearer would help me work my way up to middle management.
3,0,0,Usually a man has his own briefcase but, they have one big brief are for the three guys
4,0,0,You know Ted, three on a briefcase is bad luck.
3,1,0,These stand-up comedian funerals are easier on the back.
3,0,0,Having their long briefcase idea rejected again, the three salesman had no idea what to do next, until fate intertwined in an unusual and silly sequence of events with the elevator that led them into Hollywood slapstick.
4,0,0,It's a harp. This elevator stops at the heaven level.
5,0,0,I knew we'd find a way to carry this case forward.
4,0,0,Do you remember the 24-digit combination?
4,0,1,At least we don't need the training wheels anymore.
3,0,0,I've been working on the long range forecasts.
4,0,0,Have you seen our printer yet?
3,1,0,Don't ask!
4,0,0,This isn't what I had in mind when you said it was a long document.
2,6,1,I say that next time we try the cases separately.
4,0,0,The boss is really serious about his pool sticks!
4,0,0,The new OSHA rule requires a minimum of three executives when carrying a briefcase.
3,1,0,Maybe we're taking this carpooling thing a little too far.
2,3,0,We need a smaller laptop
3,0,0,You'vd been snooping in my files.
2,3,0,Polygamy case.
3,0,0,Do I have to attend all three meetings?
3,1,0,Will I ever get a chance to be first handle?
3,2,0,The judge is right, you've got to shorten the length of your briefs
3,1,0,Remember...were not the hit men..we're just here for cleanup.
3,0,0,One day robots will make this briefcase with only one handle.
4,0,0,It's the original manuscript of Long Day's Journey Into Night
3,1,0,Ashes require fewer pall bearers.
6,1,0,It's for our crowd sourcing presentation.
3,1,0,How come I always get the torso and you get the feet?
3,1,0,You're absolutely certain he said bedspread and not spreadsheet?
3,1,0,I thought our job ended at the funeral, now we have to carry the will too?
4,0,0,Hey - there's no 'I' in team.
3,1,0,I have a handle on the case.
3,0,0,The boss is heavier than he looks.
3,0,0,It fits the bill.
3,0,0,Tech industry...pffft! The luggage industry is what makes this country great...
4,0,0,Worst case scenario we won't all be late.
6,0,0,Find whoever filed the Kerouac suit, then fire the bastard.
3,1,0,Yes, I know. But my accountant likes the long form.
3,1,0,The Boss Said Stick Together And Handle It.
3,1,0,It's a union requirement…
3,0,0,They're going to downsize. The middleman always gets it.
3,1,0,Like they've never seen a professional pall bearer before.
3,0,0,Sharing is caring.
3,1,0,What did you expect from a joint venture in a surfboard company?
3,0,0,You're drawing needless attention to yourself.
4,2,0,You;ll get your own briefcase when you get your own key to the men's room.
3,0,0,It's my first board presentation.
7,0,0,Do YOU want to tell the boss what happened to his pet boa constrictor?
3,0,0,Okay, when we get into the interview-- just remember, we're one person.
3,1,0,Let's hope the doorman doesn't remember we were booked as a quartet!
5,0,0,Looks like we've really got things "handled" Todd... AMIRITE!!?!?! C'MON!!!
3,0,0,You think you can't smell now?
3,0,0,Gary likes the briefcase. When you're carpool captain, we can use the backpack.
4,0,0,Not what I had in mind when I suggested job sharing.
3,1,0,I'm really glad we could go into business together.
7,1,0,Quit your gripin'--plenty of musicians would jump at the chance to be second trombone and third handle.
4,0,0,Now don't forget. It's happy anniversary, not birthday.
3,0,0,I play the world's largest harmonica at this club after work.
3,0,0,Who needs guns when you have the case?
3,0,0,It's not that I mind the middle handle, I just don't feel like I'm carrying my own weight around here.
2,2,0,I don't think anyone will know we have a keyboard in here.
3,1,0,Trust me, it's harder to leave it on the subway this way.
4,0,0,Are we having another sleepover?
4,0,0,In this case, it's not so brief.
3,0,0,So much better than each of us carrying 3 briefcases...
3,0,0,We're big on teamwork here, wait til you see the bathroom
3,0,0,Weekend At Bernie Sanders'.
5,0,0,I should have told her I have a big package.
4,1,0,I was afraid he might get carried away.
4,0,0,Okay, wise guy, next time YOU put the mambas into the briefcase!
3,0,0,If you forget the presentation, can you dance the twist?
5,2,3,I'll debrief you two later.
4,0,0,Just think but for Trump we would never had the folding stretcher.
3,1,0,Just wait till you try the job sharing toilet
3,1,0,You tell him to start carrying his weight!
3,0,0,Short sales are so much easier to execute.
3,1,0,It took only one lawyer and was called a "briefcase"
4,1,0,I love this new team building exercise.
3,1,0,Does she know this corporate exercise is usually performed above the glass ceiling?
3,1,0,Thanks for helping me with my new tablet.
6,0,0,I bet the guy that invented these junior executive condo briefcases is making a fortune.
3,0,0,Don't forget the cannolis
3,0,0,Flat screen TV, guaranteed cure for the Monday Blues.
3,0,1,Is all the money suppose to be in this?
3,2,0,I told you it wouldn't stop at sharing an office.
4,1,0,I'm getting really tired of all the synergy initiatives
4,0,0,Sorry, Fella, but you guys seem way too one-dimensional to pull off this job.
3,0,0,I didn't realize I needed this much "hand-holding"!
3,0,1,You know the judge is going to throw this case out.
3,0,0,I just told them flat out 'no!' to sharing a secretary.
3,0,0,It's bad enough we have to share an office, but do we have to share everything?
4,0,0,Shh! We only got the leg part, the rest of the pieces are still inside the room.
4,0,0,I just thought that "pulling your weight" was more of a metaphor.
3,0,0,This shouldn't take very long.
3,1,0,This thing is perfect for our "board" meeting"
3,1,0,Job sharing used to sound like fun.
5,1,0,Always prepare for conference calls.
3,0,0,i'm really tired of holding up your end
3,0,0,For me, the jury is still out on the new three per cubicle policy.
4,1,0,After a while, you really get used to the job sharing program here.
3,0,0,Thanks for the help, fellas. My wife is going to love these really long earrings.
4,0,0,Don't feel funny-a lot of us share the same briefcase.
3,0,1,We all have to be on the same side on this one, Fred.
2,3,0,I said to bring everything just in case... NOT in just ONE case!
4,1,0,Company's making some major cuts.
7,2,0,This time you do the massage.
3,0,0,It's a new type of briefcase that guaranties we work together!
3,1,0,It's as if we were attachéd at the hip.
3,0,0,It's a long shot deal.
3,1,0,It's either a very large carrot or an average size stick.
3,0,0,Mother says, "Stay together!"
5,0,0,Lucky I didn't press twelve.
3,0,0,Before you can carry the nuclear football, you have to master the atomic pool cue.
3,0,0,Remember when suits came with two pairs of pants?
3,0,1,That's an extremely slow elevator.
3,1,0,I honestly don't think this is what a long brief is supposed to be
3,1,0,What does management not understand about 'brief'?
3,0,0,I get the whole three-in-a-box leadership model, but this is too much.
4,0,0,it was easier to handle during previous administrations, but now it's YUGE.
5,0,0,I'm the one who does all the heavy lifting!!
3,2,0,It is a rather lengthy brief.
4,0,0,Now remember…when we get on-stage I’ll count to three, we let him out and all yell, 'Happy Birthday, Boss'.
3,0,0,I love your hair
4,0,0,Next time can we take the Hearse?
5,1,0,Three's better than one, right?
3,2,2,I can't believe they're making us all wear the same suit!
3,0,0,Well, he did ask for a rock guitar.
3,0,0,We're here to massage the big Boss' ego
4,0,0,A connected world is a better world. Right?
2,2,0,In case you were wondering, you're in the back because you are the new guy.
3,1,0,When the boss said he had a big case for us, I thought he was talking legal.
3,1,0,I remember when bribes fit in a normal briefcase.
3,0,0,This is no picnic...
3,1,0,Do YOU have a license to carry?
3,3,1,The evidence in this case is overwhelming.
3,0,1,We use it as a battering ram to break down barriers to white men.
3,1,0,This project will go faster if you were on the same side.
3,0,0,I thought he was a no good snake.
4,0,0,Do you mind?
3,0,0,Slytherin, of course. Hufflepuff, I presume?
3,1,0,I thought you had the key for this thing.
3,1,0,Come on, Rick. Be a team player.
3,1,0,This ought to be the full body of evidence.
3,0,0,These long form briefs are killing me.
3,0,0,Where does it say that southpaws should do any heavy lifting?
3,0,1,Remember. We can't look like pool hustlers.
4,0,0,Again, when I told Mr. Simpkins we would take the case, I had no idea.
8,3,0,I don't care how rich we made him. Winning an oversized novelty check doesn't give him the right to keep my pen.
3,0,0,I told the judge it would be a long case.
3,0,0,I'm all for sharing the litigation workload, but this.......
3,0,0,Real men use Big Boy attaché cases.
3,0,1,And then the bartender asked us, 'Why the long case?'
3,0,1,It's a much lighter load when the N.S.A., C.I.A. and F.B.I. work together.
3,0,0,Remember, act like we just met.
3,1,0,He always wanted his ashes scattered near the boardroom.
5,0,1,Say what you will about the merger Bill, it is expected to promote synergy.
3,0,0,Thank goodness for concealed carry.
3,1,0,Expect this briefing to run long.
3,1,0,One tiny complaint about the handcuff, and now they don't trust me?
3,0,1,Yes, I realize I should have checked the paper settings on the printer.
3,0,0,We're decoys; the real stuff is going out the back door.
3,1,0,Does either of you remember the combination to this thing?
3,0,0,We don't need an *actual* ladder to get promoted.
3,1,0,This is NOT too heavy to be a massage table.
4,0,0,So you promise me this can stop Trump?
4,1,0,I thought our Strudel Chart was perfect for our presentation
3,1,0,Don't take what she said personally. We have small hands too.
3,0,0,So, this is the new "football"?
3,0,0,Today we're using left hands,remember?
4,1,0,A team that carries a briefcase together, works well together.
3,0,0,Remember, if TSA asks, we packed this ourselves.
6,0,0,Remember, Don, we're a team.
4,0,0,So that's it? The boss took early retirement?
3,0,0,White Collar Crime Chain Gang
2,2,0,Just think how "Handled my firm's largest cases" will look on your resume.
3,0,0,oye vey seymour, whose bright idea to schlep this trunk? next delivery, we hire a broad minded musical schlemiel to haul this contraband.
2,2,0,No one knows what's in this box.
5,1,0,Perhaps, this can be a great optic to convey that our team approach didn't work.
4,0,0,You have to admit, this is a clever way to get government agencies to work together.
5,4,0,You're the one that wanted to be a partner.
4,0,0,This new iPhone case is a real lifesaver, eh?
3,2,0,I think the merger is going well.
6,0,0,The boss has really been going overboard with his Costco Business Membership.
3,0,0,Remind me again how this ping pong table is part of our strategy?
3,1,0,So, what's the deal with your eyebrows?
6,0,1,So THAT'S where he got the hotdog for last month's caption contest!
3,0,0,Don't you just love team-building activities?
3,0,0,Correct me in front of a client again and you're fired.
3,0,0,Someday I'll die, and you'll get to hold the middle handle. Maybe.
4,0,0,Aw. Freeze drying, an elevator, half as many pall bearers, this new technology is making the funeral business so much better
4,0,0,...appears we're on the same career track.
4,0,0,Next time I'll get one with two handles.
3,1,0,It's a trick I learned when filing briefs for the NRA.
4,0,0,If the sharks don't like our idea, we can super-size it for the Mafia.
4,2,1,You two take the credit. I'm just the middleman.
3,0,0,Good news, I hear Ben Carson is taking surgery appointments again.
3,1,0,Did you know Nick Charles very long?
3,1,0,This case is likely to stretch on.
2,2,0,At this rate, the project for next month will be that big that we won't be able to enter in the elevator
3,0,0,Remind me: Are we three ad guys with storyboards, or three hit men with machine guns?
3,0,0,We share a hoagie.
3,0,0,I told you to play the flute.
3,0,0,The court won't allow separate briefs.
3,0,0,Well, it is unequal; my handle is really a breakaway 45.
3,0,0,Does this equate to larger paychecks?
5,0,0,Does holding this section of our bag make me look gay?
3,1,0,Well, we did agree to triple job-share.
3,0,0,No I don't have Al Sharpton's number.
2,2,0,Remember, speak softly.
3,0,0,A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH IS MY BEST LUNCH!
3,2,2,This is the biggest case in our firm's history.
3,0,0,On the plus side, more rules, more decrees.
3,1,0,Yes, but you're using your right hand.
4,0,0,Keep acting inconspicuously and they'll never notice it is missing.
3,0,0,Triple indemnity riders.
5,2,1,It's hush-hush, but supposedly he died from an eating disorder.
3,0,0,These days you never know who your delivering a Hero to.
3,1,0,Is it heavy? I'm just faking it.
2,2,0,If I told you, I'd have to shoot you.
3,0,0,This is my first triple-murder-case.
3,1,0,And job sharing hits a new low.
3,0,0,If you don't stop pouting Mike, we'll replace you with Maude.
4,1,0,I hate it when he gets the six foot sub.
3,0,0,Remember: BE the trifecta.
6,0,0,Its a campaign contribution.
2,2,0,It's a concealed weapon.
3,1,0,I thought you said you were left handed.
5,1,0,This is why I prefer to print just the executive summary.
4,0,0,Look out Johnson & Johnson, here comes Gary, Gary & Gary.
3,1,0,I hate presenting to mortuaries.
4,0,1,As you can see with our new patented Casket Compression Technology™ pallbearing becomes a breeze.
3,0,0,Why do they keep calling us the "Trump Triplets?"
3,0,1,I still have problems with the common bedroom.
4,0,0,It's the opposite of brief.
3,0,0,I'll switch with you if you can guess what's in this thing.
3,0,0,'It started right after someone told the boss's son about multitasking.'
4,0,0,Sorry, but Tailgate Yoga class is Saturday afternoon.
3,0,1,Wait till you see what the team building experts have done with the toilets.
3,1,0,I still get funny looks when I'm the middle man !
3,0,0,When I made the reservation, the guy on phone said, "Yes. We have a room for three ... 45 dollars a night. I didn't realize it was $345 a night.""
4,1,0,You might think she never saw men share the same briefcase before.
3,1,1,They did warn me it was going to be a long case.
3,1,0,The team-building activities lately are not working.
3,0,0,She's onto us.
3,2,1,it's nice that we all work on the same floor.
3,2,1,We're filing the long form.
3,0,0,Either focus, Hal, or agree to a coxswain!
3,0,0,Ted, we're a team. Get on this side.
3,1,0,I thought I said one Hero sandwich for each of us.
3,0,0,I thought a "happy ending" would really boost company morale.
3,0,0,She said we're over-compensating for the size of our hands.
3,0,0,This guy thinks he's going to get away with one tip?
3,0,0,You stick out like a sore thumb. Next time you walk behind me and we all walk in unison.
3,1,0,We will wait for practice till neighbors have gone to sleep.
3,0,0,Since we are all dress alike, we are sure to land this new gig!
3,1,0,You know, we can't all take this case.
3,2,0,When we get inside, let me do a third of the talking.
3,0,0,Hey,its my bag bub,if you want a bag go get your own.
3,0,0,Stop it! No will notice three dudes in suits with a three handle suitcase!
5,0,0,The modern mafia no loner uses Tommy guns and violin cases. We've found shoulder launched missiles to be much more persuasive.
2,2,0,How about we take up ping pong instead?
3,0,0,Good thing we got off the elevator together.
3,0,0,He ain't heavy. He's my brother.
3,0,0,Don't be obvious about looking, but the woman behind us is the daughter of Elsa Maxwell.
3,1,0,We should consider switching to info-sharing on the Cloud instead.
2,0,0,why the long file?
3,0,0,Carpooling I get, but...?
3,0,0,Next time just pretend you sneezed.
2,2,0,This is the big one. We all need to be on the same side.
3,0,0,Well, at least he's a burden we longer have to shoulder.
3,0,1,If we're going to handle this case properly, we all need to be on the same side!
3,0,0,Wow, the briefcase-pool express elevator totally cuts our commute time!
4,0,0,Steve, if you aren't going to carry your weight then you need to just let go and let us do our job. Steve, I'm your drinking buddy. Let's do this.
3,0,0,It's the yardstick to end all yardsticks.
3,2,0,Next time, I call shotgun.
4,0,1,If you ask me, Uber's briefcase sharing service leaves a lot to be desired.
6,2,0,Great job maneuvering the elevator. Next challenge, the men's room.
3,1,0,If you think this is bad, wait til you the bathroom break policy.
3,1,0,Remember we call it an Uber briefcase and think it's perfect for a shared economy.
4,0,0,OK - Heads I win - Tails you Lose.
3,0,0,If you were a team player you'd have my back right now.
5,0,0,Sometimes teamwork takes up space.
3,1,0,First the open office, then the shared desks . . . now this?
4,0,0,I'm beginning to hope it's a gun.
4,0,1,Yes Mel, "The Will" mentions a preference for Southpaw pallbearers
2,2,0,I feel like a pall bearer for a really bad big idea.
5,0,0,I'm sure this us not what we meant when we asked for a triple bassoon.
4,0,0,When I suggested we balance the workload, this is not what I had in mind.
3,2,0,Bloody team-building exercises.
3,1,0,Next time we file a brief, we should use a narrower font.
2,0,0,You know it's not going to be a good board meeting when they make us bring our own board.
7,0,0,Who knew triple bottom line accounting would be so popular?
3,0,0,New union rules, all Uzis are a three man carry!
3,0,0,It's a really big account.
2,0,0,Remember when all you needed to carry was a violin case?
3,1,0,Stop calling "Shotgun!" before we get to the car!
3,0,0,You're new here aren't you?
3,0,0,I need to go to the men's room
3,1,0,Don't be rediculous, it has always been alphabetical.
5,0,0,They're going to shred it and spread the ashes across the Pacific.
3,1,0,It's a Supreme Court brief.
5,0,0,I don't think security has a profile for you in this configuration.
2,2,0,I can't wait until we can stop using the long forms.
4,0,2,Because we're a team, Bob, a single unified team.
3,0,0,Wait, you work on the second floor?
3,0,0,just remember, its a base trombone
3,4,0,You should see my business cards.
3,1,1,I thought you had the combination.
2,0,0,It's important you get on the RIGHT side of the sharing economy
2,2,0,Remember the good old days when the Gun would fit in A violin case
3,1,0,We'll all be happier when the plans for the new Triborough Bridge are made public."
5,1,0,What an honor to be Bloomberg's pallbearer, right?
4,1,0,Cash like this? Definitely a king mattress.
4,0,0,This job sharing has gone too far!
3,0,0,White in front, colored behind!
4,0,0,No, I think it's just a case of left-handed-ism.
3,1,1,You'll never move up a handle with an attitude like that.
3,0,0,Yeah, I do all my presentations in Cinerama.
3,0,0,I don't know why he can't the interns to shred his emails.
3,1,0,Couldn't we have just written a check?
3,0,0,Two's company, three's a crowd...so scram.
3,1,1,What do you mean you want to cut out the middleman?
4,0,0,this working as a 'trio' really sucks
3,0,0,Can you believe they're still called 'briefs'?
5,2,0,The prosecution keeps saying we're all connected by this case.
4,1,0,Did anyone see you?
3,0,0,It's all very scientific. For creativity, it's left hands, controlling the right side of the suitcase.
3,2,2,Here at Dooley, Daniels and Dunne, we take job-sharing very seriously.
3,0,0,The amount of clothes my wife needs for a two-day trip never ceases to amaze me.
3,1,0,So I said, "Why do cases need to be *brief*? Why not a *long*case?"
3,1,0,There is a mandatory debriefing session for all those handling this case.
3,1,1,It''s expected to be a long trial.
3,1,0,I hear lots of Americans are working longer.
2,2,0,Don't you feel the synergy?
3,1,0,Just remember that his wife's name is Susan.
3,0,0,In business, we call this the three handed deal!
5,0,0,My wife wasn't happy when I told her we were job sharing again this weekend.
3,0,0,It was your idea to file the long form.
4,1,0,Old-boy briefcase.
3,0,0,I'm starting to rethink this briefcase pooling idea.
3,0,0,I told them we had a big idea for a new keyboard.
2,2,0,I can't keep getting in-between you guys.
4,0,0,Accessorizing with synergy suits you.
5,0,0,What's all this talk about cutting out the middle man?
3,2,1,We need a roadie!
3,0,0,I still say he wanted a three piece suit.
4,0,0,This is the second smallest wedding I've every catered.
8,2,0,I still think printing the document on multiple pages makes more sense.
3,0,1,but we have separate rooms
5,0,0,Guys, I know we are three men doing one job, but I think we could at least bring separate briefcases to work.
3,1,0,We do have tiny hands, but our briefs are large.
4,0,0,Toasted, Triple Long Sub, with everything on it.
3,0,0,The agency is big on portmanteau words.
3,1,0,This is my other smartphone.
4,0,0,It's true. The bigger the briefs, the sweeter the legal motion.
3,1,0,Our vacations are even more interesting.
5,0,0,There is nothing brief about this brief case.
3,1,0,Why don't we just show them a picture of the bazooka?
3,0,0,When you enter the conference room be sure not to bump into the door
3,0,0,That's none of your business, snake. I mean Blake.
6,0,0,Are you sure this is what they meant by 'meeting with the brass?'
6,0,1,Car pooling? Sure. Briefcase pooling? Really annoying.
3,0,0,You know the last one of these we carried turned out to be your partner's casket?" "Yeah? Well, let's hope that this one is your wife..." "...Agreed.
3,1,0,Thanks for helping me sneak in this guitar.
4,0,0,Let's take this thing.
3,2,0,These mergers are becoming a little excessive.
3,0,0,Not my idea of how a bassoon trio would work.
4,1,0,I'm glad we all work on the same floor.
2,4,0,I'm glad the judge granted our extension.
3,0,0,They're not BRIEF case briefs.
3,0,0,I don't care if you're right arm is an orthotic, you need to be on this side.
3,1,1,I still wish we could afford an editor.
4,2,0,I hate going to long meetings.
3,0,0,It's still considered a 'Brief " case.
3,1,0,I just think the three piece briefcase is not going to catch on.

2,1,0,I don’t care if you have a blister. Get over here. We look stupid.
3,1,0,I'm the new guy, Paul Bearer.
3,1,0,Some cases require bigger briefs.
3,2,1,I'm a nervous wreck, all I hear is talk of them cutting out the middleman.
3,0,0,Remember to tell them we worked at Uber.
3,1,0,Yes, Wally, it's obvious if the loot is in laundry bags.
6,1,0,Hey Bob... Why don't they have pupils?
2,4,0,I don't see this merger working out long term.
4,2,2,I know you've got your eye on my job, Ted.
3,0,0,Consider us as the three wise men reincarnated.
3,0,0,The new "lengthy" case brings a team of suits closer together.

3,1,0,Wait til you see the toilet.
3,0,0,Look again: The nose of the large head is the chin of the small head.
3,2,0,It's time you both pull your own weights.
5,0,0,I value self-reliance above all else... in my employees.
3,0,0,...and when you feel ready to also be a little more flexible in your attitude, you're welcome to come back and join our group again.
5,0,0,Wait until the jury gets a look at these Mormon briefs.
3,0,0,Extendocase, when an ordinary briefcase just won't do!
3,1,0,And that's how I made it to middle management.
3,0,0,The client insists on a gold-plated defense.
5,0,1,Are you saying it smells funny ha ha or funny peculiar?
5,1,0,The Smith sextuplets had to take the stairs

5,2,0,Some days I feel like a pallbearer for my own career.
3,1,0,First job sharing, now this. I call it over-sharing.
4,0,0,I agreed to the carpool and the time-share vacation condo, but this is totally ridiculous!
4,0,0,It's a lengthy brief.
4,0,0,And why would three people be needed to carry a trombone?
3,0,0,Remember, bring out the Bazooka right after I say ' Are you ready to pay for the wall yet Mexico?'
2,2,0,Remember at the corners you and Johnson walk clockwise.
3,0,0,"Wanna see 'no hands' again?

2,1,0,I hope they like snakes.
3,1,1,Sharing files was easier at my last job.
2,3,0,So this is socialism huh?
3,1,1,I think the benefits of file sharing were grossly exaggerated.
3,2,1,All the pallbearing industry needed was a little professionalizing.
3,0,0,You should see the case we use to carry the boss' ego.
3,1,0,It's better than sharing a paycheck.
6,0,0,What's a computer?
3,2,0,Next time I want to lead
3,0,0,You take the kill shot, we'll handle the collateral damage.
2,2,0,Look important and nobody will know that we are delivering a 3 foot sub to the boss.
3,0,0,I can't wait to meet our wife.
5,0,0,What's that saying again? Three connected briefcases are better than one.

5,0,0,Have you noticed Bernie has two more left sleeve buttons than me and one more than you.
4,2,0,I get front on the way back.
5,0,0,I'm tired of being on the heavy metals demo team. Plus, I think it's making our eyes bug out of our heads.
3,0,0,If we assemble Dr. Carson early we can surely fix that anti-Trump glitch.
3,0,0,I really thought our idea was a home run this time.
3,0,0,We've got to maintain the image that we're all in this together.
3,1,0,I understand the need for cutbacks, but requiring three of us to share one briefcase is a bit extreme, don't you think?
4,0,2,There's got to be a better way to do 'no-iron' pants.
3,0,0,He wanted to be buried in a suitcase.
3,0,0,I guess the boss really meant it when he said "All hands on deck."

3,1,0,"Just going for it" won't get us through the revolving doors.
3,0,0,Mr. Trump has especially large briefs...
4,0,1,This isn't what I thought the boss meant when he said this was a three-man case
4,3,4,We're only allowed one carry on item.

3,1,1,Speak softly, but carry a big brief case.
4,0,0,Well it's your floor now.
3,1,0,This is the most complete corporate merger I can ever remember.
3,0,1,It's not brief, is it?
3,0,0,Leading from behind, eh?
3,1,0,Which side of this case are you on?
3,0,0,We're taking advantage of the "carried interest" loophole.
3,0,0,Asking for raises altogether was unwise.
4,1,0,Who's idea was it to bring the not-so-brief case.
3,0,0,Is this Long Dong's briefs?
4,3,0,We should have filed the short form.
3,1,0,Apparently it's a bad idea to bring a list of Americans killed by guns to a Ted Cruz rally
3,0,0,This is our 2 Man Carry, Presentation Case. We're with an Ad Agency
3,1,0,I hope you remembered the fulcrum.
4,1,0,Not a brief brief
2,1,0,My shrink said to lose the excess baggage.
4,0,0,Are you sure Joe wanted to be buried like this?
3,0,1,Share an office? Why?
3,2,0,I dread the day they get rid of the middle man.
2,1,0,How I miss having hundred dollar bills...
2,2,0,When we asked if you were a lefty, we weren't referring to your politics.
3,0,0,This is how we at Phillip, Bustyr and Blather do briefs, my boy.
4,1,2,When they ask "Where's Waldo?", let me do the talking!
4,1,0,After years of working together, they found themselves on opposing sides of the case
3,1,0,We'd like your perspective on handling this case.

3,0,0,Ralphie are you sure he wants this for a ping pong table
3,1,0,Why am I always the middle man?
3,1,0,If you stay on the right side of the case we will look more bi-partisian
3,0,1,This may prove cumbersome near the urinal.
3,1,0,Now, you're sure they insisted on the long-form contract?
3,0,0,Yes, it's very similar to car-pooling.
5,0,1,I hope you have your concealed carry permit with you.
4,1,0,You're SURE these were his funeral instructions?
3,0,0,If you think the company's new team briefcase is bad, wait till you see the redesigned executive washroom.
3,1,0,When the boss said to bury the project, I didn't realize he meant literally.
2,2,0,I love our carpool. I guess I just need more "me" time.
3,0,0,Do you ever feel like you're doing the work of three people?
3,0,0,I guess 3 does not = company, after all.
4,1,2,What do you mean you forgot your combination number?!
3,1,0,Stop worrying, she's not focused on our small hands...
3,1,0,Token rightie
3,1,0,Hey, do you know what we have in here? My arm is getting tired.
3,0,0,On the ride down lets play Salsa.
3,0,0,I'll admit it: I had my doubts about the new synergy initiative.

3,0,0,You got a better way of getting him into the rally?
5,2,0,It's nice to know that they can make a sandwich that fits in our briefcase.

3,1,0,Let me do the talking, ok?
3,0,0,Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz holding Immigration laws with Hillary in the back.

5,0,0,Are you guys here for the accounting job too?
3,0,0,The new Office Supply Manager's name is Paul Bearer.
4,0,0,Clear your calendar. We are literally involved with a long case.
3,0,0,How'd you get picked to be the Pallbearer? I won the New Yorker Caption Contest. Crazy Prize.
3,0,0,We're in this together, right?
4,0,0,Silently, Fred feared this might be an indicator of their hotel accommodations.
3,0,0,I wouldn't really say this case is brief, exactly.
2,2,0,Judge Richards prefers briefs on 8" by 50" papyrus.
3,2,1,A closely-guarded iPhone 7 Plus prototype.

3,0,0,We're taking this teamwork thing to the extremes...
4,0,0,The board's really upset. We're gonna need to fall on our swords.
3,1,0,When Jerry said look like a team, I didn't think this is what he had in mind.
2,2,0,Wait until you see the new urinals.
3,1,0,We're drifting right again. Smedley's not much of a team player, is he?
3,0,0,The public has never really been comfortable with the pallbearers-in-training program!
7,3,0,I think an electronic shared folder would be more effective.
2,2,0,If everybody takes their cues from me, we should be able to run the table.
3,0,0,This way none of us can be fired.
5,0,1,Next time, let's take the stairs.
3,0,1,The conjoined bovine triplets were as inseparable in death as they were in life.

3,0,0,Remember Jim, we need you, try not to fly off the handle again!
4,0,0,Why do people stare when you take the handle at the back?

3,0,0,And you didn't actually understand me when I told you to table the decision, did you?
3,0,0,Why should you be up front?
3,0,0,Separate, but equal?
2,2,0,You see value in middlemen, right?
3,1,0,I hope the new "communal team" concept stops at the door to the washroom.
6,0,0,Remember back in the 80s when they told us that computers would result in a paperless society?

3,0,0,I never realized you were left handed.
3,0,0,The briefcase is obsolete... that's our sales pitch.
3,1,0,Smithers, if we are to have a chance with this case, you have to get on the right side.

5,0,0,This isn't working for me; I want to go back to having my own briefcase.

3,0,0,Are you two plotting to cut out the middleman? middlemen.
3,0,0,Due to the size of the dearly departed the funeral home only needed three pall bearers.
3,0,0,''We save on buying separate brief cases."
3,0,0,Joe, my last day is Friday. I'm tired of being the middle man.
6,0,0,These ten year plans are a real back breaker.
3,0,1,You know, we were all supposed to get the same haircut too.
3,0,0,It's a good thing Fenton has a left arm.
4,0,0,Who are you that we should go to this length to accommodate your trust issues?
4,0,0,Someone should have told me about the Boss's Inner Punster before I insisted that we all be put on the same case.
3,0,0,I suppose you also want to cut out the middle man.
3,0,0,There's nothing wrong with the size of his gloves.
3,1,0,Thanks for the help with my new iPhone.
3,0,0,Here comes a right turn, two steps for every one I take.
4,0,0,Shouldn't we stagger which side we're each on?

3,0,0,Well ... we do the job of one.
3,0,0,Any idea for a caption?
3,0,0,Snitch
3,1,0,I know everyone loves party subs, but is silly.
3,1,0,Do you think they believed our commitment to teamwork?
3,0,0,I'm having difficulty getting used to the extent of our merger.
3,0,0,We'd be more balanced, if I was an Asian woman.
3,0,0,Gosh, Mark Cuban is an a$$hole.

5,1,0,Let's keep this brief.
3,1,0,The online approach to reaching a remote audience is not in sync with today's hefty one-on-one presentation. Today begins with ensuring we have something to hold onto.

3,0,0,Ok guys, all we have to do is make sure nobody knows that in this suitcase lies the perfect ingredient for Jeff's surprise party.
3,0,0,I hope our suitcase doesn't get us in trouble like it did last time." "I'm worried we'll get that mad secret-agent room again." "Guys, we're here. Let's open the door..." "ITS THE SECRET AGENT ROOM!
3,1,0,We probably don't need our documents in triplicate.
3,1,0,Yes, I guess having a 52" notebook does kind of defeat the purpose.
3,1,0,Microsoft Word upgraded their 'merge documents' tool.
2,2,0,Must we take it so literally when a project is killed?
4,1,2,Do you think our brief is too long?
3,1,1,So how did you know Slim?
3,0,0,Does this briefcase make my hands look small?
3,0,0,"Our presentation? I thought his critique* was rather lengthy." *underlined
3,0,0,Keeping the GOP candidate secret until the last moment (or poll).
2,2,0,Accounting insisted we file the long form this year.
3,1,0,The lawyers from Long & Longer were legendary for their lengthy briefs.
4,1,0,Have you ever been to a mortician's board meeting?
4,2,0,I hate these long briefs
3,1,0,This is gonna be a long meeting.
3,2,0,I still miss the bobsled.
4,0,0,Must you always order the giant burrito?
4,0,0,Spewell, Deutch and Rowland eschews brief cases.
3,1,0,You are right. This does make me feel more important.
2,2,0,I really appreciate you for being a pallbearer for my portfolio.
3,0,0,I'm telling you. Briefcase pooling is going to be the next big thing.
3,1,0,This teamwork initiative is getting out of hand.
4,0,0,You would think the body of the banana republican party will be heavier than this.
4,0,0,Well, it's time to retire this suitcase until next year's Academy Awards.
4,0,0,The boss wants this to go smoothly.
7,3,0,Are we all on the same page?
3,1,0,Let's be discreet.
3,1,0,Seriously Bob, don't worry. The first gig was a fluke, everyone loves triple neck guitar groups.
3,0,0,How do I say this? This thing is just a cover. I left the memory chip in the airport washroom.
3,0,0,Isn't it funny how heavy this is?
4,0,0,Now remember, the last guy left with his hand on the briefcase gets the corner office, but he has to share the private bathroom with the other two guys.
4,2,0,It's quite an honor to carry Mr. Trump's briefcase.
3,0,0,I reckon octets have to take the stairs.
3,0,0,There really is an Uber for everything now.
3,0,0,I don't even work on this floor.
3,1,0,And the Devil makes three.
3,0,1,Who are you working for?
3,1,0,I told you stupid ideas work.
5,0,0,I resent your disintermediation suggestions.
4,0,0,All your presentations fall flat, Higgins.
2,2,0,The investors will love this.
3,1,0,I don't think we thought this mobile office thing through.
3,0,0,You get used to it after you've been job sharing a while.
3,0,0,It's all about that bass.
3,0,0,I'm thinking 'Uber Attache' is a bridge too far.
3,1,0,Then I'll say, 'Your honor, this case is not brief.'
4,1,0,Now remember, when we get in there, we talk with one voice.
3,1,0,These board meetings get any longer we're going to need more help.
3,0,0,But I really have to go!
3,0,0,Parker ordered it when he heard the new CEO was into threesomes.
3,0,0,I told you we were going to look like idiots.
2,2,0,This merger has gone too far.
3,1,0,I'm heading to the restroom. You too?
3,1,0,I don't mind sharing an office, but...
3,1,0,If you don't get yourself in rhythm, Tom, we're going to have to find ourselves a coxswain.
3,0,1,"Yell loudly and carry a big briefcase" - Donald Trump
3,1,0,I didn't know you were right-handed.
4,0,0,You were right, this is the easiest way to remove an interloper from a Trump rally.
3,0,0,It's time to massage the results.
4,2,0,Flip charts have saved our company a bundle in marketing.
3,2,1,It's a good thing we all work on the same floor.
3,1,0,First day working at a pallbearer's office?
3,0,0,So, we're going with three pool cues, yeah?
5,1,0,Siamese businessmen, joined by the esprit de corpse.
3,1,0,How many businessmen does it take to open a briefcase?
5,2,0,It comes in handy when 48-inch subs go on sale.
3,0,0,We had to use a road roller to fit him in the box.
4,0,0,It's the new triple secure delivery.
2,3,0,I worry that I'll never move beyond middle management.
3,1,0,Why do we always have to pay cash?
3,0,0,On the contrary, I thought there was just the right amount of humour in our presentation.
3,1,0,Just once I want to be first.
3,0,0,You know our side will always carry more weight.
6,1,0,You should have seen the size of the Beta version.
3,0,0,Ready for another long meeting?
2,3,0,Maybe we've taken this sharing economy thing too far?
5,0,0,I can't believe THIS is what they came up with for the 21st century casket.
3,0,0,Where do you want to set up?
3,0,0,I can't shake the feeling that if we downsize, I'll be the first to go.
3,1,0,I can't wait till they go digital.
3,0,0,And I thought the merger was a bit of a stretch.
3,0,0,With three guys on this case, we've definitely got them beat.
3,1,1,Middle management is harder than it looks.
5,0,0,So my daughter tells me we should be worried about this thing called "the cloud".
4,0,1,The judge said it would be a long case.
3,0,0,Berra, maybe.
5,0,0,Don't you hate spread sheets.
3,0,0,Yes, it is a big large for a briefcase, but it's where Trump keeps his other set of hands.
3,0,0,Do you even lift?
3,0,0,Escalators and stairs are a bit more challenging.
3,1,1,Are you from the steering committee?
3,0,0,The ad said 3 assistants needed for company's attaché
4,0,0,I hate team projects.
3,1,0,This "corporate culture" thing stinks.
4,0,0,Our new job description is "white collar Sherpa".
3,1,0,Does this mean we have equal shares?
4,2,1,Just hope the doorman doesn't remember we were booked as a quartet!
3,1,1,He wants a long, drawn-out case.
3,0,0,This new "power team" approach is getting out of hand.
3,2,0,He was short and very slender.
3,0,0,I told you we should have gone with plan B.
3,0,0,These three guys need to hold one suitcase because of their ridiculously small hands.
3,1,0,I told you that our presentation should have been outside the box.
2,2,0,Are we all going to the same meeting?
4,1,0,Evidently getting run over by a steamroller requires only three pallbearers.
3,0,0,I thought we'd never lay this case to rest.
3,1,0,I'm not sure I like the not-so brief case.
3,0,0,We should go for 'open carry.'
3,0,0,Democrat?
3,0,0,Psst! On 'three' we drop it, OK?
3,0,0,We need to show them we're on the same page.
3,0,0,I read they do this at Google
3,0,0,If these smart phones get any bigger, I swear I'm giving 'em up.
3,1,0,Remember: our thinking is "inside the box".
3,0,0,By the way, Moe, I paid extra for your handle.
3,0,0,I anticipate a real long session today. So I left my brief case at home.
4,1,0,For the last time, this is not a briefcase.
3,1,1,The sharing economy has officially gone too far.
3,0,1,We're filing a long brief.
4,0,1,Whose turn was it to bring lunch today?
5,1,0,I heard they’re adding 2 more guys to the Fail Safe Team.
5,0,0,It is no an indication of physical weakness; we believe in 'shared responsibility'.....
3,0,0,When he said we'd be sharing cases, I did not take it literally.
2,2,0,It is part of the company's new job share program.
3,0,0,Chauncey, let's not have any of that 'thinking outside the box' crap during today's presentation shall we.
3,0,0,If you stop looking at me like that, maybe she won’t realize it’s a corpse.
3,1,1,He says 'coming about', you shift to the starboard side.
3,0,0,I think you've moved too far to the left.
3,3,1,If we turn around, will you stop talking about Rosa Parks?
3,0,0,Now we'll just have to wait for the dust to settle.
3,0,0,I used to have you job but now I'm the middleman.
4,2,0,Why do you think we were called into this redundancy meeting?
3,0,0,What's your problem? The boss said he wanted a big alligator case, so we got one, capeesh?
3,0,0,Miley's here.
4,0,0,Sure it's cost effective, but brief case sharing is extreme.
2,2,0,When I die, I'm leaving my handle to you.
4,0,0,What's up for the weekend?
2,2,0,It's not a briefcase — it's a lengthy case.
3,0,0,If you ask me, that team-building management consultant has gone too far this time!
3,0,0,Count D. know you're moonlighting, day-shift dude?
5,0,0,We thought he said "cater to the BASS"
3,0,0,I told you that near the end, he lost a lot of weight.
5,0,0,This job sharing is becoming confining.
2,0,0,El Chapo is a genius.
3,1,0,The only way I got the job was to say I could do the work of three people.
5,0,0,It's either this or we're joined at the hip, and frankly, cowhide is more cost-effective.
3,1,0,This company takes "collaboration" seriously.
3,0,0,Don't worry, not even Marco can make fun of your hands here.
3,0,1,The flute paid the piper. This is his casket.
3,0,0,Sorry, I can't share my stapler. I have to draw the line somewhere.
4,0,1,I see you finally grasp the sharing economy, Jim.
2,4,0,Post-merger integration they said
4,0,0,I love you guys.
2,3,0,We always work as a team here.
3,1,0,It's not an open and shut case.
3,0,0,Dumb-ass jury. It always worked for the Stooges.
6,0,0,Next they are going to merge us into one big one.
5,0,0,You look different on the other side of the briefcase. I almost didn't recognize you.
4,0,0,That chick was bangin'!
2,2,0,Hilary asked for her longform birth certificate - you know, just in case.
3,1,0,Are you sure we shouldn't look inside before we bury this overly large briefcase in the desert?
3,0,1,It was a very long brief
5,0,0,This time make sure the flat tax stays buried.
3,0,0,Do you think we're taking the open-office plan too far?
5,0,0,I knew the judge would think our brief was too long.
4,0,0,It's "our" report, but Slide 27 is all me.
5,0,0,Forget the ergonomic benefits, this has a real fun factor!
3,2,0,I'm used to smaller caseloads.
3,0,0,Bathroom breaks are tricky, it's best if you hold it until the end of the day.
3,1,0,I love the new suitcase pool.
5,0,0,Mr. Draghi loves blasting his big bazooka.
3,1,0,It shows that we're all on the same page, literally.
3,1,0,I felt you'd take that side of the case.
4,0,0,I told you that it would be a long, drawn out, legal process...
4,1,0,You're not holding up your end.
2,2,0,No matter what case we're working on, you always have to take the other side, don't you.
3,0,0,Well she gave us a look...what's her problem?
3,0,0,I gotta be honest, I find elements of the merger demeaning.
3,1,0,Pallbearer practice for the funeral of the inventor of the briefcase.
3,0,0,Why did we all share one luggage?
6,0,0,It took Jenkins there ten years, but he made it to head intern.
4,1,0,"Stop looking at me! I keep tell you, this is not odd!
4,0,1,I told you panoramic selfies wouldn't fly.
4,1,0,They say that the laptop caused the death of the briefcase.
3,0,1,Threesome at my place?
3,0,0,Death contracts should always be a one man job.
3,0,0,Remember: All for one and one for all.
3,1,0,Why is everyone getting on my case?
3,1,0,We have the same briefcase.
3,0,0,The prosecutor is anything but brief.
3,1,1,It looked a lot cooler on the Sky Mall website.
3,1,0,Holding up your end of the deal gets tricky on the commute.
3,0,0,I think management is taking this team work thing a little too far.
2,2,0,Go left.
4,0,0,Do you think she suspects the boss is in the case?
7,0,0,When I joined the Secret Service the last detail I expected to receive was carrying Donald Trump's hair around.
5,1,0,No, I don't think this team-building stuff has gone a little too far.
3,0,0,Just remember, small hands big briefcase.
3,1,0,This is a joint venture.
3,1,0,You are on the wrong side.
3,0,0,You know that teaming software they got us? This is the computer.
3,0,1,Do you think the matching suits are too much?
4,0,0,I know it's ridiculous, but the new boss loves teamwork
3,0,0,We are all into this now!
3,1,0,Don't you think this teamwork thing is getting out of hand?
5,0,0,Is this the new 2016 suitcase they made?I wonder what it will look like in 2026.
3,0,0,Right...right...right left right...
3,2,0,I don't think esprit de corpse was what they had in mind.
3,0,0,Believe it or not, we used to have four on a briefcase.
3,0,1,I think it's time that we learn PowerPoint.
3,1,0,Now we can triple-bill the client.
3,0,0,I hope our next President simplifies the diversity regulations.
3,0,0,Subway must really want their recipe for the four-foot-long kept secret.
3,1,0,I blame the carpool culture.
6,0,0,I understood when one person needed to do the work of three, but I don't get this new strategy.
3,2,0,Well, it's certainly not a brief case...
4,1,0,This is my first big case.
4,0,0,If he says no, you cover the door while Larry and I break out the long form
3,0,0,One day you too could be middle briefcase.
3,0,0,I thought I was taking the lead on this case.
4,1,0,Did you see the strange look that woman in the elevator gave us?
4,2,0,It's our biggest case yet. Our only worry is the courtroom door.
3,0,0,This is taking teamwork a little too far.
3,0,0,The courthouse is a good place for us legal pad salesmen!
2,2,0,I thought I'd get in some ironing during the meeting.
5,0,0,I miss being a human centipede.
3,0,0,How else should we carry our long underwear?
5,1,0,If Doublemint sold, Quadrillionmint will conquer.
3,1,0,Our work may get mixed up, but at least it can fit the entire hogie.
4,0,0,It's Trump's briefs.
3,1,0,It's the ten-foot pole he wouldn't touch the $15-minimum-wage issue with.
4,0,0,We're kinda playing fast and loose with the word "brief."
4,0,0,hello
3,1,0,Sorry, I called shotgun.
3,0,0,Thanks. It's called 'a not-at-all-briefcase.'
3,0,0,Did you lock the tandem?
3,3,0,Fred and I feel you're not carrying your share of the load.
3,1,0,I trust the pen is in here this time.
4,0,0,I specifically told both of you not to wear the same suits for the second meeting.
3,1,0,I'm guessing you're right handed.
3,1,1,It's a Mormon divorce.
5,1,0,I think they have taken the teamwork concept too far.
3,1,0,If we act like it's a big idea, the client believes it's a big idea.
3,0,0,Do you really think they'll like what we brought?
3,0,0,Really...how many guys does it take to carry his "Make America Great Again" caps?
3,0,0,I'm beginning to have doubts about our budget file sharing system.
3,0,0,I'm sure she would have loved you if we had the right briefcase.
3,0,0,Who gets to carry Jimmy Hoffa around next year?
5,1,0,The IT people asked for a new platform and this should do the trick.
3,0,0,Listen up, we first say, 'Boss, we have a new Stradivarius', and then we open fire.
3,0,0,Trust me, I get that look a lot.
3,1,0,"When Paul retires, you can have my spot".
3,0,0,Don't offer to eliminate the middleman!
3,0,0,This is the most collaborative office I've ever worked in.
3,0,1,So, you're on the other side of the case now.
3,1,1,She was totally checking me out.
3,0,0,I've heard of taking your work home with you, but this is ridiculous.
3,0,0,He's taking Tiny Hands to the next level. This is his new Speedo.
3,0,0,Bathroom,anyone?
3,1,0,Who are we to deny Bill's final request?
5,0,0,We've got this Davis, we really only need two pallbearers for the thin man.
3,1,0,I'm pushing it down.
3,0,0,My name isn't Malcolm
3,0,0,Ever thought of getting your own briefcase?.
5,0,0,Clearly, Anderson, you don't have the right stuff.
3,1,0,Mr. Spence said Ralph would never return to work.
3,1,0,its like we practiced....1,2,3....1,2,3
4,0,0,Don't you think we're taking this whole carpool business just a bit to far?
3,0,0,Hard to believe that I first resisted this idea.
4,0,0,We're from a really big law firm!
3,0,0,You ask him. I'm tired of being the middleman.
4,1,0,I remember when they used to call these "brief" cases?
3,0,0,It may not be the briefest, but at least it gets the job done.
4,0,0,I prefer to think of it as a longcase.
3,0,0,Downsizing? It isn't a matter of time here, it's a matter of how.
3,0,0,I think we've taken the carpool too far.
3,1,0,I really hope they see the big picture.
5,1,0,The team building article said that activities don't have to be wild and crazy, just fun.
4,0,1,Ever handled a case this big?
4,1,1,I'll tell you what's in here; it's a long story.
3,0,0,We went paperless.
4,1,0,The law firm is very excited. This is the biggest case we have ever had.
3,0,0,It's his golf clubs. He backed over them with his car.
3,2,0,Not surprising that her husband was buried in a piano.
4,0,0,I predict a huge increase in productivity after we unveil this rocket launcher.
3,0,0,From now on, I'm going to handle this case my way.
3,1,1,I heard they are the Sponge Bob briefs.
2,2,0,We let go on three
3,0,0,So apparently we all "work well with others"?
5,0,0,I'm wondering how brief this case is gonna be.
2,2,0,Whose passport will we use at TSA?
3,0,1,I suppose this has as good a chance as any of distracting from the leg shackles.
4,0,0,At the interview, remind them that we also carpool
3,0,0,This team building is getting out of hand.
5,0,0,When I said we needed a better handle on this case, Morty, I didn't mean this.
3,0,0,First the rent-a-car, now the briefcase....I'll tell you this much: we are checking into three separate hotels!
4,1,0,Man, these power lunches are getting longer, and longer and longer.
4,0,1,My last case was even longer.
3,0,0,Don't you think about time for Flat Stanley to walk on his own two feet?
5,0,1,Tuesdays and Thursdays I get to use my left hand.
3,0,0,Looks like our ex-wife is on our again.
4,0,0,High-rise mortuaries are the future, but the sales calls can be embarrassing.
7,1,0,So this is the guy from the February 22 cartoon. Wonder what happens to us after this week.
3,0,0,Remember…tight on the left turns …and take it wide on the rights.
3,1,0,I heard I'm getting promoted to front handle soon.
4,1,2,As soon as no one's looking, we fill this baby with K-cups.
4,0,0,He's my mentor, just like you're my mentee.
5,0,0,Trust me, middle management is nothing to aspire to.
3,0,0,Stop looking as if we are pallbearers and lets get this pitch underway.
5,1,1,Well, our body of evidence is authentic.
3,2,0,I carry you two.
3,0,0,What did Ben Franklin say about three keeping a secret?
3,0,0,Will you remind me again what we're telling people is inside of this thing?
3,0,0,This is the longest brief I've ever filed.
5,0,0,No way; just a flatter viola!
3,1,0,I really hope no one feels an irresistible urge to tell a light bulb joke.
3,0,0,"As always, we're the 3 Briefkateers".
3,0,0,He definitely mentioned an elephant in the room?
3,0,0,I told ("told" underlined or bold) you it was a long shot!
3,0,0,Working in long-form journalism has its disadvantages.
3,1,0,There's an element of teamwork required here, Jones.
4,0,1,You forgot the missile launch codes ??!! Uh oh. Me too.
3,0,0,My lunch is off limits.
3,0,0,Don't touch my bag, please.
3,0,0,I'm going to room 218. You?
3,0,0,Would you please get on the other side. You're attracting attention and embarrassing us.
3,0,0,Being a roadie isn't the the thrill it used to be.
4,0,2,This is the biggest case we've taken to court
3,0,0,It's just great to feel a part of something.
3,0,0,Keep your eyes on the prize.
4,1,1,Let's not take this diversity stuff too far, Jenkins.
3,1,0,I hope this doesn't take too long.
3,0,1,Do you think they suspect we're cutting out early to go surfing?
3,0,0,Is it me? Or were those guys acting kind of Neanderthal?
3,1,0,The End, Flat Stanley. The. End.
6,0,0,The size of this brief better not correlate with the length of the trial....
7,1,1,"Do you think they will think we are "TEAM PLAYERS" now?
4,0,0,There's safety in numbers, but this is silly, we're grown men.
3,0,0,If you fit, we'll sneak you out next.
5,0,0,Welcome to Three's Company.
4,0,0,Wiener dog jokes at a Dachshund murder scene are over the top
4,0,1,It feels wrong calling it a briefcase.
4,0,0,I don't know, but I've been TOLLLDDD...
5,1,0,It's the only real way to move a billion dollars.
5,0,0,Now that we've started job sharing, how about we share those sandwiches too?
5,0,1,Whose side of the briefcase are you on, anyway?
3,0,0,Of course I'm needed. It's my case.
4,0,0,He insisted on a wide screen presentation.
3,0,1,There are only two muskets in here. You still have to complete your training.
3,0,1,You needn't mention the steamroller.
3,0,0,You lefties always screw things up.
4,0,0,He has small hands.
3,1,0,That presentation killed!
4,0,0,Look, time was we used to bring violin cases to business with Trump. Is it any wonder, given the election, we bring a slide trombone case now?
2,3,0,Finally, we've all gotten a handle on this case!
3,2,0,It's all about sharing the workload.
4,2,0,I have to go to the bathroom.
3,1,0,I think we have a handle on this case.
3,0,0,I hear that this holds the origins of the universe.
4,2,2,Just do what I do.
3,1,0,This "team" concept sucks.
3,0,0,Actually, getting to carry "The Big Briefcase" is considered quite an honor!
3,0,0,Car pooling was bad enough but this is emasculating.
3,1,0,If anybody asks, we are not together.
4,1,1,It's a new type of paper called Super-legal.
2,2,0," Now, look straight and walk like we belong here".
3,0,0,Luau box.
3,0,0,You've heard of carry all bags? This is an all-carry suitcase.
3,0,1,Thanks for your help, this is a really big case for me.
3,1,1,Remember when cases were brief?
6,4,0,I wish mother wouldn't pack our lunches together.
3,0,0,Being a lobbyist for the funeral home industry isn't as much fun as I thought it would be.
5,0,1,Does she realize this is all of her paperwork?
3,0,0,Elevators good. Revolving doors bad.
3,0,0,Next time we each carry our own lunchbox.
