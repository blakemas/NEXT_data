3,1,0,I wouldn't worry about the promotion if I were you.
4,0,0,"Im telling you Braverman, this meeting is over"!
3,0,1,Some days are worse than others.
4,0,0,By the way, I've decided to end the affair...
2,2,0,Haven't you always thought anvils were more of a wedding thing?
3,1,0,Your not going to believe this but I think things are finally falling into place for me.
3,1,0,I lost my wife, job, life savings, at least it can't get any worse....
3,0,1,I'm so glad they kept this place open during remodeling.
5,0,0,I just wish something would hit me that could change my life.
3,0,1,No, he won't.
1,3,0,At least I've still got my faith.
2,2,0,It looks like I've got the check.
4,0,0,As you know, I rarely make hasty decisions...
2,2,0,Got any aspirin? I feel a crushing headache coming on.
3,1,0,My book on fate is nearly finished.
4,0,0,I'm going to need more coffee for this meeting.
4,0,0,Good news. You won't have to do the presentation.
4,1,0,I just don't see how this day could get any worse.
3,1,0,I'm not that worried about sugar killing me.
3,1,0,Frankly, I find the media's continual 'sky is falling' mentality tiresome.
3,1,0,Without an eyewitness or a murder weapon we're gonna need something really concrete here.
3,0,0,"Heavy" coffee? Yes. But not as heavy as it will be, yet.
4,0,0,I'm terribly worried about rising sea levels.
4,0,0,This gives new meaning to espresso.
3,1,0,What a joke, the bottom's going to fall out.
3,1,0,I'm SO boring. Just once I would like to be newsworthy.
3,1,1,Actuarially speaking, I've got another good 40 years ahead of me.
4,0,0,You're right, Ted. You're not paranoid...
3,1,0,I just can't seem to shake this feeling of impending doom.
4,0,0,It's really quite rudimentary. The easiest way to win The New Yorker caption contest, I've found, is --
4,0,0,Of course, if something were to . . .
3,1,0,I can't tell how lucky I feel to have someone like you to talk to."
4,0,0,What is wrong Joe?. Ever since 9/11, you seem to be preoccupied with imaginary objects falling from the sky.
4,0,0,Better cover your drink.
5,0,0,Man, I hit a brick wall at work today!
4,0,0,So then I just walked out before she could retaliate.
2,1,1,I think we are getting a gentle hint to vacate the table!
4,0,0,I think I have been blocking a lot
5,0,0,Hmmm.Could be a lawsuit.
3,1,0,What time you got?
4,1,0,Don't give me that 'sky is falling' rhetoric.
5,0,0,There is a God.
4,0,1,You might want to change your position
3,1,0,What I'm about to say will change your life forever.
5,0,0,We no longer have a concrete deal.
3,0,0,Your ex-wife has sent something for you!"
4,0,0,That's about all the time I can block out for now.
3,1,0,I just need to come up with something really concrete, NOW!
4,0,0,Too bad. He's a nice guy.
4,0,0,This above all: to thine own self be true.
3,1,0,What say we skip dessert?
4,0,0,After all those salmonella outbreaks, what more could go wrong at Chipotle?
4,0,0,I said "Doris, I'd sooner be stoned than agree to that property settlement."
4,1,0,Not the building block I was praying for.
3,1,0,So it's basically uber but for construction materials
3,1,1,I'm telling you, my life can't get any worse.
4,0,0,When you sell insurance, you have coverage for everything.
3,2,0,I can't fathom how my life could get worse.
4,0,0,I'm so ready for a change.
4,1,0,Move?! I'm rent stabilized!
3,2,0,...and then the medium said that today I would be struck dead by a cinder block and so I avoided the construction by my office building entirely.
5,0,0,Sometimes I think inevitability is a very hazy concept.
3,0,0,So I tell the kid, You create your own luck.
2,1,1,I switched to decaf for my health.
3,2,0,I used to be able to tell when my luck was about to run out...
3,1,0,What were you saying about tomorrow?
3,1,0,Oh, by the way, I landed a blockbuster deal this morning.
5,0,0,Why are you canceling my promotion announcement tomorrow?
4,0,0,I think they want us to order a full meal.
4,0,0,So I told her just to cancel my life insurance since I work in an office. What could happen to me?
4,0,0,Sorry to tell you this, but I'm going to have to let you go.
3,0,0,Last time I ignored it. You see, existence needs concep--
5,0,0,I just wish life were more like cartoons, y'know?
2,1,1,You will not believe the week I've had.
4,1,0,So my doctor told me I can't keep eating red meat.
4,1,0,Did you order the brick?
4,1,0,The main stream media are a bunch of Chicken Littles.
3,1,0,Are commodities falling again?
4,0,0,Did you order the express box lunch?
5,0,0,To my knowledge, no on has ever called me a blockhead.
3,0,1,... and if it's not true, may God strike me dead.
4,0,0,I really don't need that extra life insurance right now.
3,1,0,I hear they've opened a Zumba upstairs.
3,1,0,Yeah, well. At least I've got my health.
3,0,1,So the cement union's not happy, how's that going to affect me personally?
1,2,1,I wish there was a way to guarantee that I don't outlive my retirement savings.
3,0,0,Chip! The block!
4,0,0,And then I said to myself, "Bill, you gotta make some concrete plans for your future."
4,0,0,Before we wrap things up here, there is just one last thing I feel I should bring to your attention.
4,0,0,I need something more concrete than just "a sign."
5,0,0,Well I'll be damned, he was guilty.
4,0,1,Boy, I could really use something to clear out my head.
4,0,0,You should have asked for a ham omlette.
4,0,0,Please be accurate Jim. It's not a brick, it's a cinder block.
3,0,1,I lost everything! What else could go wrong?
4,0,1,With my bad luck, they'll have forgotten the cream.
3,1,0,Your student loans are about to become less of a problem
3,1,0,So how exactly does trickle-down economics work?
3,0,0,So then she says, "Something really bad is going to happen to you today."
4,0,0,I hate to be the one who says the sky is falling, but . . .
4,1,0,... so I finally get the feeling things are going my way.
5,0,0,I can't imagine anything else going wrong today.
3,1,0,I violated my non-disclosure agreement.
4,0,0,Tell me fast--who are you voting for?
4,0,0,This is what I've learned: it's all about risk-management.
4,0,0,He should have had a V8.
3,1,1,Who calls someone "blockhead" these days?
1,2,1,I was considering how we might cut building costs, and then it hit me!
5,0,0,If I can just block out the distractions I know I can cement the deal.
3,1,0,I'm struggling to overcome an irrational fear of impending doom.
4,0,0,Really, what makes you think he's a brick short?
4,0,0,Black Swans Unlimited had the lowest bid.
4,0,0,I wonder, is it true what they say about the falling real estate market?
4,0,0,Heaven knows! We need solid building blocks for the success of this project.
4,0,0,Looks like he is about to regret winning that game of "jinx."
4,0,0,What do you mean by "Cinder Block of Damocles?'
4,0,0,Today's Special...Squash?
3,1,0,That's the last time I'm ordering a kale salad.
2,1,0,So my agent says "you never know what might hit you."
5,0,0,Where are we with succession planning?" "Almost finished with Phase 1.
4,0,0,And speaking of a chip off the old block....
2,1,1,Why do you insurance guys always end up talking about risk and prudent planning ?
4,0,0,I'm sorry, Dave, but your promotion will just have to wait for a vacancy in managment." "I'm okay with that, Bill.
3,2,0,So now I'm sitting here, waiting for the other shoe to drop...
3,1,0,Yes, my wife is still allergic to flowers. Why?
4,1,0,I feel like a huge weight has been lifted.
2,0,2,I dunno. There must be some metaphor for a Trump presidential win.
4,0,0,I've just been named the "Master of Your Fate" speaker of the year.
1,3,0,I mean, this day just can't get any worse.
2,2,1,I hear too much caffeine can kill you.
5,0,0,You gotta stop eating sandwiches every day, Mike. The carbs are gonna kill you.
1,2,0,Unless it's a light bulb I don't want to know.
2,0,1,This little place deserves more publicity.
3,1,0,Do we have to decide right this second?
2,2,0,Like you always say, "Today's the first day of the rest of my life."
3,1,0,Drone delivery of building supplies? Never happen.
3,1,0,My wife says it's risky to drink from a styrofoam cup.
3,1,0,I don't believe in gravity.
4,0,0,You blockhead!
4,0,0,I had that dream last night where you can't seem to get away from impending doom.
2,2,0,I'm just trying not to take everything so personally.
4,0,0,I wonder how the artist feels about what happens next?
5,0,0,Are you trying to scare me ?
3,2,0,I feel like writing these online restaurant reviews has finally given me the outlet to find my true voice.
4,0,0,We may not have to plan that far ahead.
4,0,0,You can take this personally.
4,0,0,Could we get the check, please?
2,2,0,Wait. Let's me get this.
3,1,0,They say their dessert is a real blockbuster.
3,2,0,New York Life; why do you ask?
2,1,1,The thing is, people never think about infrastructure until it impacts them directly.
4,0,0,I can't believe my eyes a brick is falling through this restaurant!
4,0,0,I think I'm coming down with "Architect's Block".
3,2,0,Uh oh, what fresh hell is this?
5,0,0,And those are the benefits of trickle-down econ... [THUMP]
4,0,0,Can you imagine anything worse Can you imagine anything worse than our negoti Can you imagine anything worse now that our negotiations have hit a brick wall?
4,0,0,Is this a good time to talk about life insurance?
4,0,0,Why are all the people in the office calling me Chicken Little?
5,0,0,The idea hit Jerry like a ton of brinks.
3,0,0,I hope the sky falls on me if I even think about voting for that clown!
3,0,1,Have those responses on my desk by the end of the day. I want the calendar cleared before my vacation. While I'm gone, you'll be researching cases for next month. You'll probably have to work both weekends to get it all done.
4,0,0,So all of a sudden the thing comes crashing down like a ton of bricks, never seen anything like it.
5,0,0,I feel inspiration is going to hit me any second!
4,0,0,"Annh," he deserves it.
4,0,0,You can't always expect "pennies from heaven."
3,1,0,Mr Stevens, all I need is a quick signature in case anything unexpected happens.
3,0,0,It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a brick!" "Seriously dude! Think of something better for the new Superman.
4,0,0,What you wanted to say was "figuratively."
3,1,0,Don't let such things go to your head.
3,1,0,Things are finally going right for me.
3,1,0,Life insurance ?
5,0,0,This story could be a block buster.
1,2,0,Really? Yelp reviews can be anonymous?
4,0,0,Technically, I am a "beta-tester" for Acme Corporation
4,0,1,I just can't seem to cement this in my head
3,0,1,I finally feel like my luck is about to change ...
3,1,0,I thought it was always lightning bolts.
4,0,0,Whaddya mean I'm a 'chip off the old block'?
5,0,0,You're a dreamer, Bill. I need a concrete solution, or you can look for another job.
4,0,0,The downfall of pop-up restaurants!
4,0,0,Fasting on Yom Kippur is for suckers.
5,0,0,What's up, coffee dude? Nothing much, sandwich dude cartoon by levi
2,0,2,How's your little chicken sandwich?
4,0,0,Hmmm..."Heads up!" is probably the wrong warning....
4,0,0,It's sword of DAMOCLES. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,I'm suffering writer's block. Man, what can be worse than writer's block?
5,0,0,'hmm... do I open the umbrella and risk bad luck?'
3,0,0,There goes the debt ceiling...
3,0,0,No. I'm fine. No complaints.
3,1,0,Buy the shares Ted....trust me.....I'm never wrong....I'm naturally lucky.
4,0,0,You were right all along. If you expect good things to happen, they will
4,1,0,These days one never knows what might fall from the sky!
4,0,0,Well maybe not like a TON of bricks...
2,2,0,Is there something you aren't telling me?
4,0,1,So you think the term life policy makes more sense. Why?
4,0,0,This is why I only drink decaf. Caffeine hits me like a brick.
4,1,0,You better watch the Reubens, George. Pastrami will kill you.
3,1,0,This burger is going down like a ton of bricks." "Speaking of which...
3,0,1,The desserts are good except the sponge cake is a bit heavy.
2,0,0,Oops, I spoke too soon.
4,0,0,Heads up dude!!!!
3,0,0,You know, I am the luckiest man alive.
3,0,0,So I said "Curse away you old witch..."
4,0,0,I've had this strange premonition all morning that this afternoon would be a career change.

4,0,0,First time ever two really good things happened for me today
4,0,0,My goal is to become a talking head at the network

4,0,0,Oh, about 10,000 to 1, why?
4,0,0,I think they may be taking the idea of ‘deconstructed cuisine’ a little too far.
3,1,0,Tell me more about your accidental death and dismemberment policy.
4,1,0,When I want to feel alive I dip my fingers in hot coffee.
4,0,0,The law of gravity is immutable or so they say.

4,0,0,And that, my friend, is how I KNOW my luck's about to change.

2,2,0,You gotta be careful with these lids otherwise all the coffee falls on you.
5,0,0,Are you even listening?
5,0,0,Hmm should I tell him or not?
4,1,0,What dou you mean the future isn't bright?
4,1,0,No, I don't believe in insurance. Why?
4,0,0,You're always telling me to block things out, Jim.
4,0,0,I disagree ... Trump's through the roof!
4,0,0,Sometimes I feel just like a blockhead.
5,0,0,My motto is, live every day as if it's your last.
3,1,0,I'd like a concrete answer.
2,3,0,I've been thinking about my future.
4,0,0,Your time is up.
4,1,0,My wife wants to cement our relationship, whatever that means.

4,0,0,Regarding your cinder toffee coffee order...
4,0,0,Things are finally looking up for me, Bill. I can feel it.
3,0,0,I think opportunities arise when you are in the right place at the right time.....
2,0,0,I tell you the world's coming apart with this election.
4,0,0,Inspiration; she is a fickle muse –you never know where your next big idea will come from.
4,1,0,But on a lighter note...
4,0,0,Not a feeling, Larry. It's more like a premonition...
2,2,0,C'mon finish your coffee---I don't have much time.
2,1,0,There's a fly in your coffee!
5,0,0,You ever feel like something heavy is looming over your head?
3,1,0,We've been close for years...but they can't keep both of us.
4,0,0,I've got this weight hanging over me. Do you think my writers block will ever go away?
4,1,0,My ideas always hit me like a ton of bricks.
3,1,0,...but if somebody else slips on a banana peel, that's funny.
4,0,0,Trump or Cruz .. It' s like chunking bricks..
4,0,0,I guess I'm just tired of people telling me "to chin up."
4,0,1,I tell you, it's the same old thing every day-nothing extraordinary ever happens to me!
3,0,0,Uhh.. How do you like your coffee? One lump or two...
4,0,0,It's like the sword of Damocles, but our insurance required the two extra strings.
3,1,0,I'm getting to that age when I realize I don't have all the time in the world.
4,0,0,How about you get the check and I'll pay next time.
4,0,0,A little hair of the dog always does the trick.
3,1,0,Are you going through a divorce?
3,1,0,And so I said, "well, where do you think you're going to get a brick?"
4,0,0,Bill, stop trying to drive home the hearse!
4,0,0,It's either a small cinderblock or a ridiculous looking drone.
3,2,0,I'm lucky. I never get headaches.
3,0,1,I feel like my life has become too predictable lately.
4,1,0,Suddenly this world saving thought hit me like a brick.
2,1,1,So, how do you like the Karma Cafe?
3,1,0,Surprisingly, I've had worse dates.
3,1,0,I need some excitement in my life.
3,2,0,Well, that's another way to discourage sugary drink consumption.
5,0,0,I've got a crushing headache.
4,1,0,I'll find the next big thing if it kills me.
4,0,0,I've finally overcome my irrational fear of being hit by a falling concrete block.
4,0,0,Good thing you did not ask for two lumps!
3,1,0,So I got that going for me...
4,0,0,Yea, I'm short sellin ACME. Why?
3,1,0,Is there a problem?
4,0,0,Sometimes, I'm such a blockhead.
1,3,0,I call tails
3,1,0,Er, lean in?
5,0,0,It was a simple clerical error, Robert. May God strike me dead if I'm not telling the truth.
4,0,0,Consolidated Life. Why?
4,0,0,it's a foreboding i can't seem to block
3,1,0,Goodbye Frank.
2,2,0,Why am I so depressed?
4,0,0,You know, it's always something ....
3,1,0,If you have time tomorrow, I'll talk with Marge tonight and then we can sign that insurance policy. Will that work for you?
4,0,0,I'd do anything to get on the nightly news.
4,0,0,There must be a quicker way to lower our overhead.
5,0,0,I don't mind tossing out a blockbuster idea, it's the catching I hate.
3,0,0,We may have unplugged Mother a little too soon.
3,1,0,Have you ever had that feeling...?
4,0,0,I hear Acme made some changes in their product line.
4,1,0,And if I'm lying, may God strike me dead.
4,0,0,Perhaps its time to hedge your postition
4,0,0,What's that analogy when you feel completely floored by something?
5,0,0,Karma: "Who are you calling a blockhead?"
5,0,0,Mind your own business.
5,0,0,Listen, I need that fifty dollars you owe me. Quickly.
4,0,1,I just can't shake this feeling of impending doom.
4,0,0,Please pass the sugar, quickly.
3,1,0,So, now I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
4,0,0,Bernie? Nah. More likely a cement block will drop on my head.
4,0,0,Apparently, this place is known for its flattened chicken.
4,0,0,Well, as you can imagine, the news hit me like 37 pounds of brick
2,1,1,Say what?
4,0,0,I am ready for a coffee "break".
3,1,0,For years I struggled with the meaning of life . . . then it hit me like a ton of bricks.
3,1,1,So, tell me something I don't know.
3,0,0,I'd better prepare for the vice presidency opening.
4,0,0,I wish I knew.
5,0,0,My suggestion ... DUCK!
4,0,0,I'd never let Trump build a wall in my uterus.
3,1,0,Boy, this writer's block is really killing me.
3,1,1,And the bad news?
2,1,1,You never look at me when I'm talking.
3,0,0,Maybe some coffee will clear up this mental block.
4,0,0,I have the worst case of writer's block.
3,1,0,I'd like to say that it can't get any worse, but...
3,2,0,I think we should have lunch together more often!
3,1,0,You're the last person who should be giving me a 'Heads up.'
3,1,0,Your proposal is a little heavy handed
4,1,0,Maybe God will send a sign.
4,0,0,It kills me having to work through lunch.
2,1,1,And, great news, right after lunch I'm going to change my will and make you the beneficiary.
5,0,0,We've all had a stale bagel, but this is ridiculous.
4,0,0,Mark my words Bob, the bottom of the Market is going to drop out any day now!
5,0,0,Hey Bill, that Excedrin is finally starting to kick in.
3,0,0,I don't think this is the pool deck, Kenny....
4,0,0,What can happen?
3,1,1,All of a sudden it hit me!
3,0,0,I'm having something different.
4,0,0,why'd I get this to go?
4,0,0,Did you see her face when I asked for a fifth cup of coffee?
5,0,0,To sum up my posit....
2,2,0,All this hype about concussions is way overblown.
1,2,0,I've led a charmed life.
3,0,1,Well, it's not the SWORD of Damocles...."
4,0,0,Not the first time I have had a mental block.
4,0,0,And that's when I first started to question Newton's theories.
3,1,0,This is a no-brainer, Hal.
4,0,0,If the coffee doesn't wake you up, this place has something stronger that will do the job.
4,0,1,But do you have any concrete suggestions?
4,0,0,I chose this restaurant because they always have a daily surprise on their menu.
4,0,0,I tipped with a Trump dollar.
3,1,0,Whoa....did you just call me a BLOCKHEAD!
4,0,0,I'll buy lunch!
4,0,0,Looks like the wall got 10 feet taller
4,0,0,Relax and thank God it is not the oroverbial ton.
3,1,0,Believe me Frank, I've been around the block.
4,0,0,I can't recommend the cement.
4,1,0,Nice to relax...absolutely nothing has been going my way today.
5,0,0,S&P Futures are plummeting. I predict a catastrophic day ahead.
4,0,0,I prefer to call it "accident" and health coverage.
2,1,1,Life's too short to be worrying about everything.
3,1,0,And if Donald Trump isn't the best candidate of the whole pack, may a great cinder block strike me on the head RIGHT NOW!
2,1,1,No, theoretical physics will have a much greater impact than applied physics.
3,2,0,I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
4,0,0,Talking to a friend like you is like a load of bra
2,1,0,I'm having second thoughts on my year without tipping.
4,0,0,It's gonna hit you in 3...2....
4,0,0,I hate that new church, I hope a sinner blocks the door!
5,0,0,I still don't have replies on Tumblr.
4,0,0,Imagine-She called me a blockhead!
3,0,1,This is why I always tip.
4,0,0,So help me, if I'm lying, may I be struck dead by masonry!
3,1,0,Life's a crapshoot-I took a flyer on the Phillies at 300 to 1.
3,0,1,I'm not just saying this because I'm your life insurance agent, but...
3,0,0,So you want to be president of Damocles Construction.
4,1,0,Doesn't your ex wife work upstairs?
1,2,1,No. I don't believe I care for duck.
3,1,0,Monday mornings are so boring.
5,0,0,Why are you always such a pessimist?
3,1,0,So you say you have a contingency for anything unforeseen?
3,1,0,Revenge of the glass ceiling
3,1,0,Be careful what you wish for. Killed by idiom!
3,0,0,I probably shouldn't have played hookie today, I have so much work to do.
4,0,1,I remember when they just spat in your food.
2,0,0,So that's why I just bought a long-term care policy.
4,0,0,I'll have to let this coffee cool down
4,1,0,I don't think you understand the gravity of my situation.
3,1,0,Yeah,I definitely feel a change of luck is in the air!
3,2,0,Have any ideas on how to get out of jury duty next week?

3,1,0,Look out, here comes Cindy Block.
3,0,1,Do you believe in Karma?
4,1,0,I don't get "interesting" surprises.
2,2,0,I'm about to lose my mind.
3,1,0,Think I'll skip dessert.
3,2,0,What do you mean I have a hard head? Give me one concrete example.
2,2,0,Yup, she doubled the policy.
3,0,0,I think it's your turn to pay.
5,0,0,I'm hoping Maybe inspiration will just hit me.
4,0,0,A breeze block? Someone's got a loose grip on reality
4,1,0,Last week was so tough. It was like being hit by a ton of bricks.
4,0,0,Dave, I think this is the right moment to tell you that I've been having an affair with your wife. But I'm going to have to fire you again.
4,0,0,If this block hangs over my head much longer, I'm dead.
3,0,0,Hey Bob, you might want to take that coffee to go.
4,1,0,I still don't see why we should spend our dear dollars on research on anti gravity...
4,0,0,So I said a ton of bricks doesn't have to fall on my head. What?
4,0,0,I preferred when they retaliated by spitting on your sandwich.
3,1,0,I think I can offer you some concrete advice.
3,1,0,My wife says I've become a doom and gloom Republican. What the hell does she know?
3,1,0,I think something big is going to happen soon.
3,1,0,I don't play the odds. I deal with the here and now.
3,0,1,Oh, Ignatz!
2,1,1,No one EVER notices the severed finger on the table...
4,0,0,Ever get the feeling you are about to get clobbered?
2,1,1,My new will leaves everything to the Mason Beneficial Society.
5,0,0,That is if they ever find me.
4,0,0,Like Yogi said, 'It ain't over 'til it's over.'
4,0,0,So then it hit me, like a ...
4,0,0,Stop talking about bricks and mortar projects. All that matters is the cloud.
4,0,0,There must be a reason for everything.
4,0,0,I don't care, I said don't talk to me until I've had my coffee
3,1,0,You know that cookie will kill you, don't you ?
3,2,0,Did you read the part where he said, "Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick".
4,0,0,I really think 'no tipping' is catching on
3,2,0,At least today can't get any worse....
2,1,0,I changed my mind. Let's take it to go.
4,0,0,Day after day I wait, for that concrete evidence suggesting there is more to life.
5,0,0,Gotta admit I'm ambivalent when it comes to Right to Life Right to Choice issues
3,0,0,Of course, short-term investments carry less risk, but . . . .
2,1,1,I just read that gravity is just a scientific theory, not an actual law.
5,0,0,And she's constantly making empty threats.
4,1,0,...but I do feel there is a correction coming
2,2,0,Any last words?
4,0,0,I'm not sure what my last meal would be. Why do you ask?
3,0,0,My best ideas come out of the blue.
4,0,0,I had a dream last night someone called me a blockhead.
4,0,0,Sometimes I feel like the Brick of Damocles is hanging over me.
2,1,0,My success is a function of talent and hard work. I don't believe in luck.
4,0,0,It can't be a brick. It's always a safe or a piano.
4,0,0,...and then she said, and then he said....
3,0,0,Hear about Bob? Heart attack. Just like tha-
2,2,0,Do you believe everything happens for a reason?
3,0,0,I think you will soon have a more concrete idea.
0,1,3,If I am lying then let God strike me dead!
2,1,1,Don't worry, this one's on me.
3,1,0,But Hell. Y'know what they say, ' Every dark cloud...'
1,2,0,Believe it or not but I'll get the check this time.
3,1,0,So this cartoon coyote keeps following me around.
2,1,1,An extra coffee break never killed anyone.
3,1,1,If I am lying, may God strike me dead.
1,3,0,JUST SIGN IT.
4,0,0,Does it ever appear to you like Starbucks stores just drop from the sky?
3,2,0,It doesn't take a brick falling on my head before I get it.
1,3,0,..she says she will build one. He says he won't build one. But I tell ya, what we really need, is a sign from above.
3,1,0,I'm just waiting for the other brick to fall.
3,1,0,"Donald, did you read your horoscope today?
3,0,1,Ready for a shock? I have the winning lottery ticket in my pocket.
3,1,0,Jones, we're going to have to start from the ground up on this one, a block at a time.
4,0,0,Well at least he'll have no worries about the election!
2,2,1,I feel more validated now that my wife increased my life insurance.
5,0,0,Did I say my ex is likely to get even with me.
4,0,0,I have never had writer's block quite like this
3,1,1,Do you have anything for a headache?
3,2,0,I didn't want to tell you, but...
3,0,1,So yesterday I was thinking - "Why not? We'll meet. We'll eat. We'll drink ...
4,1,0,Thanks for listening, I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders.
3,0,0,This doesn't look like a flat white.
3,0,0,I accepted a job with Joe Btfspik & Sons.
4,0,0,This restaurant is a killer.
0,2,2,I'm being terminated.
4,0,0,I'm gluten-free, dairy-free, entirely organic from my toothpaste to my shoe polish, yet I still get these crushing headaches at least once a day.
4,0,0,Yes. I will marry you.
4,0,0,That's what I love about this place, the strongest coffee and the heaviest bricks.
2,2,0,Your problem is you're a pessimist.
4,1,0,I need the caffeine but it usually gives me a headache
3,0,0,... and I told that fortune-telling mason to go **** himself.
3,0,0,My future feels up in the air.
4,0,0,Ever wonder why some people are in the wrong place at the wrong time?
4,0,0,So ... when do you think Mort will drop in?
5,0,0,Sugar? One brick or two?
4,0,0,...and then, it finally hit me...
3,1,0,Stocks are dropping, bonds are dropping-
4,0,0,I think we should take the long view.
4,0,0,Nothing specific, really. Just a general sense of foreboding.
4,0,0,. . . and literally make America great again. But hey–it's your daydream.
3,0,0,I'm an agnostic too, Herb, all the way--no wait! I didn't mean that!
4,0,0,should i save him pr let him die so i can get the job
3,1,0,Food trucks shmood trucks--nothing beats a brick and mortar restaurant.
4,0,0,Did you ever get THAT feeling?
3,0,2,It's time you quit interrupting me.
4,0,0,Watch out, the Trumptastrophe is falling!
4,0,0,Are you an insurance salesman?
4,0,0,Don't worry about making it to your next appointment.
4,0,0,I wonder why it's called a deconstructed latte.
4,0,0,Did I unplug my straightener this morning?
3,0,0,Oh, I say old chap, have you been reading in the NEW YORK TIMES the news about India?
2,1,0,Have you nothing more concrete to offer?
4,0,0,I subscribe to the Alan King policy of not needing Insurance. Spend the money on a nice piece of pie.
5,0,0,So you forgot the remote again?
3,1,0,This taste bitter to you?
3,1,1,You know those divorce papers you think your wife is trying to serve you with . . .
3,1,1,Who's the Chicken Little now?
4,0,0,It's all over but the shouting.
2,1,1,Fortunately, she seems very amicable about the divorce.
2,2,0,Look, I believe that you make your own luck--
5,0,0,I wish I had a bigger sandwich than you.
5,0,0,Nevermind.
2,1,1,I wish my luck would change
3,2,0,Would it be so terrible if you looked at me while we are having a serious conversation?
4,0,0,They were out of anvils
3,2,0,I don’t care what you’re trying to say, it’s rude to talk with your mouth full.
3,1,0,I'd like to put you in charge of our crisis management team, effective immediately.
5,0,0,I feel like the only bad thing that isn't happening to me right now is a block coming down on my head..
4,0,1,I watched 'Forrest Gump' again last night, Larry-- I think I finally get it.
4,0,0,Don't worry we a plan for any possible scenario
2,1,0,What do you mean, you think I was too fussy ordering soy, cinnamon, goat milk, and simple syrup?
3,1,0,Well, so much for all your long-term financial planning.
4,0,0,Real quickly, any other ideas?
4,0,0,You know, this maybe the last time.....
4,0,0,Knock knock.
5,0,0,I ordered an orange crush.
3,1,0,What's with the look, John?
2,2,0,My life is so damn predictable.
3,0,0,Time is really not an issue for me....
3,1,0,I can't begin to describe how bad this divorce feels.
4,0,0,It's all set. Don't be such a skeptic.
3,0,1,It's amazing how quickly they built this place.
1,2,1,Downsized from work, Jill wants a divorce... It makes you wonder what might be next.
5,0,0,Karma? Yeah, why?
4,0,0,Maybe it's a block-headed idea but...
3,0,0,I hope you paid.
3,1,0,Yes I am accident prone. Why do you ask?
2,2,0,I'm voting for Hillary.
3,2,0,I guess He heard me.
1,2,1,Relax, Chicken Little.
4,0,1,Then it just hit me from out of the blue.
4,0,0,Which is correct? Concrete or cement?
5,0,0,God never gives me a day off.
4,1,0,Every time I eat here I leave with a headache.
3,0,1,Do you think I should grow a moustache ?
5,0,0,My ability to accept the absurd has just recently came into conflict with the fact that my personal prayers are seemingly being answered
4,0,0,A 5 or 10% tip is the least of his problems
4,0,0,This place always blocks me up.
4,1,0,That's not what I meant when I suggested the restaurant have exposed brick...
3,1,0,Last night I told Susan I want a divorce. She took it surprisingly well.
2,1,0,The last thing we need is more government safety regulations.
4,0,0,Bill I think your phone is buzzing.
4,0,0,I have closing arguments in the Don Giovanni case today.
3,0,0,Looks likes concrete idea.
5,0,0,I'm really just looking for some concrete results.
2,2,0,All those burgers you eat will kill you.
2,1,0,I can't shake this feeling of impending doom. What do you think is causing it?
3,0,0,So I says, "I get it, you're mad - you don't have to hit me over the head with a brick."
0,4,0,Shouldn't we both be concerned about overhead?
4,0,0,Did you order the falling steel beam?
5,0,0,Then, in '08, I signed my largest deal...
3,1,0,For some reason I just have no interest in this presidential race.
4,0,0,But you mean "cinder block" metaphorically though, right?
3,1,0,"Really, what could be worse than Trump?
3,0,0,Do you believe in IFOs?
3,1,0,You never know when a good idea might hit you.
4,0,0,But I love, I loves my sweet rat.
2,2,0,My coffee's cold and they overcharged me for the bagel. What else could go wrong today?
3,1,0,Carpe nanosecond.
3,1,0,Fortunately, I don't have writer's block anymore
2,2,0,I just joined the Optimist Club.
4,0,0,Good thing you ordered the duck.
5,0,0,So,how'd the Trump rally go?
3,0,0,I've decided to be ironic. I mean, what's the worst thing that could happen?
5,0,0,Nothing good ever happens before my first cup of coffee.
3,1,0,This is fine, but you've probably never heard of my favorite coffee shop.
4,0,0,Ten years of therapy and I finally believe that I don't have a target on my head.
3,2,0,She did ask about my life insurance, actually. Why?
4,0,0,And I really don't buy that superstition about throwing spilled salt over the shoulder!
4,0,0,Better drink that fast, Damocles!
4,0,0,My secret is safe
4,0,0,Wait—an idea's about to hit me—I can feel it.
4,1,0,And then this jerk from accounting said, "Live every day like it was your last."
5,0,0,Don't interrupt!
4,0,0,I just feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop...
3,1,0,Well, compared to the convention this should be a breeze
2,3,0,With the divorce final, I think we can now be friends.
5,0,0,...then it hit me, like a ton of bricks.
4,0,0,This could be a New York Life moment.
3,0,0,If it wasn't for this safe haven, work would just kill me.
4,0,0,So I told him "I don't need any life insurance!"
3,1,0,Nothing. What are you doing tonight?
3,1,0,Looks like a woman finally broke through that glass ceiling of yours.
3,0,1,So much for living right.
4,0,0,Something's coming, I don't know what it is, but it is...
3,1,0,It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.
3,0,1,I can't stress this enough, Johnson--you've really got to learn to put mind over matter.
3,1,1,Sometimes I feel like such a block head.
3,0,0,I'm so stuffed up, it feels like I've got a head full of concrete.
5,0,0,Then, out of thin air, she drops the 'D' word on me!
4,0,0,My wife left me for my boss, my house burned down, my cat died but I'm finally beginning to think I've turned the corner.
4,0,0,Dang he'll probably get to take the day off for this
5,0,0,Actually, sell when YOU feel it's the right time.
2,1,0,…if it's the last thing I do!
4,0,0,You've really got to work on your pronunciation. It almost sounded like you ordered the `Cementi Grande.'
4,0,0,Don't look up. The sky is falling!
5,0,0,Can't wait to get the lid of this new Iron Brew drink Bill, they says it's made with girders!
2,1,1,You know, I just have this lucky feeling.
3,0,2,My wife's latest hobby has been estate planning.
4,0,0,Lately I've been feeling scatterbrained.
4,0,0,Thanks for meeting me here. I tell ya, there's no escaping the gravity of the situation we're in.
5,0,0,Do you have plans for dinner tonight?
3,0,0,These construction delays are killin' me.
4,0,0,I am fortunate to have a friend like you!
4,1,0,should i tell him?.. nahhh
3,1,0,I don't get it. I thought he said the Kenyan blend had a hard finish.
3,1,0,I'm dying of boredom, Bill. Nothing ever happens.
4,0,0,No one's looking out for the white guy anymore.
4,1,0,Yes, I did order the duck. You don't need to yell about it.
5,0,0,I call it the Block of Damocles.
3,1,0,Well, I know I should consider something more concrete.
5,0,0,What's the best thing for a headache?
3,1,0,Gary, I feel that now is the appropriate time to tell you that your wife and I have been having an affair.
5,0,0,I see buying this shop as a key building block in a financially secure retirement.
4,0,0,Okay, sure, if you insist. This one's on you.
3,0,0,You signed the check, right?
2,2,0,Free refills? Must be my lucky day!
4,0,0,Hartford, shmartford
5,0,0,No. Why?
3,1,0,I favor the top-down approach.
4,0,1,Sometimes I feel as though the cinder block of Damocles hangs overhead.
4,0,0,"I'll have the Grande Concussion with an extra shot, a splatter of heavy cream, and 2 sugars".
2,2,0,This headache couldn't get any worse.
3,1,1,I don't like to be a doomsayer, but....
3,1,1,You seem distracted
2,2,0,My OCD is much better thanks. Why just today I started stepping on cracks.
3,1,0,Duck? No, I'm strictly Vegan.
4,1,0,...And I told her, honey, just trust my 6th sense about these things...it'll all be fine.
2,1,1,I'd give anything not to have to go back to the office.
5,0,0,After 34 years I'm retiring from bricklaying to spend time with my family and finally write that novel I've been thinking about...
4,0,0,No way. My commodities guy sees gold, silver, and cinder block futures going up.
2,1,1,So I skip the tip and tell her she's one brick shy of a load.
3,1,0,May God strike me down if I'm wrong.
3,1,0,Theres absolutely nothing that can go wrong with this plan.
5,0,0,I want something light.
3,2,0,On the bright side, I have my health.
5,0,0,I'm glad mine's to go.
3,1,0,I wished for a ton of bricks, but this is fine.
4,0,0,Life's boring. Nothing ever happens to me.
5,0,0,So the bomb exploded but, luckily, I was unscathed.
4,0,0,Even though we are laid off, meting for lunch does Even though we are laid off, meeting for lunch is just fine.
4,0,0,And then it hit me like a blot from the blue: My wife is cheating with a brick mason.
4,0,0,Quick! Say something philosophic: your last words can't be "pass me the sugar"!
3,1,0,So the weatherman actually got one right?
3,1,0,All science is just theory. Take gravity for instance . . .
4,0,0,Every now and then, I get a mental block.
4,0,0,It's a concrete proposal, but a need a quick yes or no.
4,0,0,Yes, I'm signing my new will tomorrow, making you the sole heir.
2,1,0,All I said was she could drop a few pounds.
4,0,0,The food is pretty good but the service is average.
3,1,0,Thanks for switching spots with me. The A/C above that seat was killing me.
4,0,0,I was wondering what it would be like if Trump became President... and then it hit me.
3,1,0,I'm telling you, Frank, you're in for a rude awakening with all that gluten and read meat...
3,1,0,Things couldn't be better, thanks.
5,0,0,These estimates look promising, but I'm going to need something concrete.
5,0,0,So she say's, "one lump or two, and I'm like..........BLACK!!!
4,0,0,A blessing on your head mazal tov, mazal tov! A brick falling on your head, mazal tov, mazal tov!
4,0,0,I don't need somebody to hit me in the head with a bat to know I'm in trouble with the boss.
4,0,0,If I'm lying to you, may God strike me dead!
4,0,0,We might need to get the food to-go
2,2,0,What I wouldn't give to escape this rat race.
4,0,0,So, may I presume our conversation is over?
4,0,0,You really are a chip off the old block.
4,0,0,By the time I warn you, it will be ....(thud) too late.
3,1,0,How's it feel to hear I slept with your wife, 'Mr. Alleged Clairvoyant Magician'...
4,0,0,It's a more authentic take on exposed brick
3,1,0,Think I'll knock off early today.
1,4,0,I just finally feel like things are becoming more concrete.
5,0,0,This is my first date on Cinder. I'm really hoping you don't swipe left.
5,0,0,Funny idea of an art exhibit this cafe has...
4,0,0,I won't invest until the bottom drops out of the market.
4,0,0,What the... I ordered this black!
2,1,0,My luck is about to change. I can feel it.
3,1,0,Ugh -- decaf. Now I'm gonna have a headache all day.
3,1,0,I feel good. Like there is nothing hanging over my head anymore.
3,1,0,This may sound strange but this is the best day I've had in years
3,0,1,If you've got something to say, say it.
3,1,0,What's this item about ceiling repair?
3,1,0,You have no idea how good it feels to be out from under suspicion.
3,1,0,So, I've been very concerned about the anvil shortage.
3,1,0,The coffee's great but the decor here is too heavily brick-a-bac.
3,0,0,They say the coffee at this place is a big hit with everyone
4,1,0,It'll eventually sink in.
2,0,0,You know that stuff is going to kill you.
3,1,1,I'll let you know when I have some concrete information for you.
1,2,1,'So I said to my insurance agent, What are the odds of THAT happening?'
2,2,0,Our verbal agreement is still valid.
3,1,0,The price of coffee these days... It hits ya like a tonne of bricks.
2,1,0,And that's why I got out of construction.
4,0,0,Why yes, I do work for the Acme Company.
4,0,0,I don't know if you have time for that.
4,0,0,Sorry...missed that...having a mental block.
5,0,0,It's Tinder, but the scars are real.
4,0,0,My note says to be more obser....
4,0,0,Should've seen this one coming.
5,0,0,This Tetris demo is just the first game for our VR glasses line.
3,2,0,I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
4,0,0,Sometimes it's like the sword of Damocles is hanging over my head.
4,0,0,Being laid up in the hospital for 18 months was rough, but now that I'm starting to walk again things are really looking up!
4,0,0,No brick has to fall on my head.
3,1,0,The moment when Larry's fantasy became reality.
3,1,0,I don't think I have a future...
4,0,0,Well, I guess he did push pretty hard for a head on that coffee.
4,1,0,Jim, I'm not falling for your 'made you look' game again.
5,0,0,Hope he's voting Sanders in the primary.
4,0,0,Umm. . . . maybe you shouldn't have sworn to God that you'd build Trumps border wall yourself!
5,0,0,If I hear one more person say, "You deserve a brick today," I'm going to flip out!!
4,1,0,Wow, almost spilled my coffee!
3,1,0,Life is so unpredictable, isn't it?

5,0,0,I just have a feeling something big is coming my way...you know?
4,0,0,My mother always told me that if I'm in a quandary, just contemplate for a moment and then something will knock some sense into you.
3,0,0,You're right. An anvil would be too cliche.
3,1,0,My analyst says that my obsessive forebodings of doom are the result of unresolved attachments to my mother.
3,0,0,And then, just like that, it suddenly hit me!
4,0,0,I have complete confidence in the building inspector.

4,0,0,You're right, life sucks and then you die.
4,0,1,Weird. My wife said it felt like her lucky day this morning.
3,2,0,You know that feeling when the other shoe is about to drop?
4,0,0,Maybe it's the Law and Order binge-watching, but this new 3 million dollar life insurance policy makes me paranoid.
4,0,0,I suppose you also want me to believe in global warming...
3,1,0,Tom, you should really take back what you just said.
2,1,1,I'm not leaving a tip. Karma shmarma.

2,0,1,Lemme tell ya, Al, this latte is to die for.

5,0,0,I mean it's now or never, so I guess I'll do it.
4,0,0,If you ordered a cement block for lunch, I think it was just delivered by drone.

1,2,1,I've always made sure I'm in the right place at the right time.
4,0,0,Uh oh, I think the time's run out on my parking meter!

2,0,1,Do you think we should worry about Zika virus?
4,0,0,Mind if we swing by the pharmacy for some Tylenol on our way back to the office? I feel a headache coming on.
3,1,0,No, I don't have anything scheduled this afternoon...why do you ask?
3,2,0,I just don't see why we need to invest so much in infrastructure
3,1,0,Trust me on this one...it's a win-win situation.
5,0,0,It's simply Politics as Usual - not impending doom.
4,0,0,Honestly Henry, sometimes I think you worry too much.
4,0,0,The wages of cinder block
4,1,0,Did you ever have one of those days where nothing goes right?
3,2,0,It's all good.

1,2,1,You know you shouldn't eat that junk, right?
3,0,1,Do you ever feel like you can sense a headache before it happens?
2,0,2,I'm sure the other shoe will fall soon enough.
4,0,0,Making helmets mandatory in coffee shops may be too little, too late.
3,1,0,No, I don't want a refill. Why?
3,0,0,Nice try Tom... What is it this time, a cinder block?!
2,1,1,Which is the better deal, term insurance or whole life?
3,2,0,I've never felt quite this alive before.
2,1,0,And then it hit me.......a metaphor can never actually happen or it wouldn't be a metaphor.
4,1,0,I agree. If you see something, say something.
4,0,0,Uh, I just wanted to thank you for picking this place away from the office to fire me .
3,0,1,I can be as hard headed as the next man.
3,0,1,My doctor said I suffer from chicken little syndrome...
4,0,0,After you asked for the divorce, you didn't, by chance, suggest she block out a few ideas for the settlement?
4,0,0,I feel like there's a ton hanging over my head.
4,0,0,I tell you again "I've had it."
2,2,0,I'm supposed to be off caffeine, but one cup won't kill me.
2,2,1,I think the management welcomed my criticism of the macchiato.
4,0,0,Hmm...I would warn him, but I know he's for Trump.
4,1,0,Oh good! It looks like the housing market is rebounding.
4,0,0,I did warn him it's a concrete jungle out here.
4,0,0,From now on, I'm really gonna' try to just live in the moment more.
3,1,0,What you don't know can't hurt you.
4,0,0,The silver lining -- it's not a ton of bricks.
3,2,0,I just don't get how you can put your faith in something that never gives you any concrete evidence of its existence...
4,0,0,I'v been invited to a block party
1,3,0,We need a concrete plan.
3,0,0,My jury duty case? Aren't they all scaffolding accidents?!
4,0,0,You have to be really hardheaded to survive is this business.
3,1,0,I'm having a no good, very bad day!
1,2,1,I'm proud to say I got this place built three months ahead of schedule and at thirty-five percent below budget.
4,0,0,WAITER!!
4,0,0,I don't know what to tell you, Robert. These construction defect liability laws are killing us.
4,0,0,Trump's campaign is on shaky ground.
4,0,0,I really think term life insurance is the best for me.
4,1,0,I'm just going to march right in there and make it clear that I'm not going anywhere.
3,2,0,What an odd chandelier.
2,1,0,Let's keep this on a need-to-know basis.
4,1,0,The fixtures are tacky but I like the exposed brick.
4,0,0,I think our cyber waiter has arrived.
3,1,1,I think I will take that life insurance policy.
3,1,0,Those people just bring down the block.
5,0,0,I like this place because of the low overhead.
3,1,0,Damn, it was supposed to be a piano.
3,1,0,I have these migraines and
1,3,0,It can't get any worse!
4,0,0,I guess I will pick-up the tab.
3,1,0,Man.. I am ready for a change...
5,0,0,Mind your coffee, dear.
2,1,1,For the first time in my life, I'm in love.
3,1,0,Yup, you're gonna be late all right.
4,0,0,Sword of Damocles, Wilson. It was a sword.
3,1,0,Helen texted I should expect her answer anytime now.
4,0,0,Sometimes I feel like I've just hit a wall, ya know?
2,1,0,We figured the best place to cut corners was with the mason's contract.
3,1,1,So...what's up?
4,0,0,Decaf--just my luck!
5,0,0,Then she started blathering on about 'karma'. I mean, what a bunch of nonsense.
3,0,1,My analyst tells me that I need to change my "Chicken Little" view of the world.

4,0,0,I'm still waiting for my fifteen minutes of fame.
4,0,0,Who told Michael Crawford he was funny?
4,0,0,I'm tired of complaining but, honestly, it seems like it's just one damn thing after another.
2,2,0,And if that's not the truth, may God ...
4,0,0,I wish now that I had splurged on a donut.
5,0,0,It's incredible. I've finally learned to live in the moment.
2,2,0,I'll need some proof that the building is structurally unsound.
3,1,0,Let me explain why your contract with the mob is non-binding.
3,1,0,Hurry up and sign the life insurance application Charles.
4,1,0,My doctor says that by substituting the cream with soy milk, I should add a couple years to my life.
4,0,0,So Nancy wants to do dinner with you and Beth next week.
4,0,0,Sometimes I like to dip my fingers in cold water.
4,0,0,I feel so lucky having run into outside my favorite lunch spot.
4,0,0,So, if you don't believe in evolution, do you believe in gravity?
2,2,0,They never leave enough room for cream.
3,1,1,Nothing is ever your fault. Isn't that right, Spencer?
4,1,0,You already paid the check, RIGHT???

5,0,0,"Well, that's a load off my chest. Next?
4,0,0,The divorce is final, I've moved into a great two bedroom, and I just got a promotion. You know, I finally feel like things are falling my way.
5,0,0,It's your turn to pick up the check, right?
4,0,0,Criticizing his friends for speaking with their mouths full of food would prove to be the biggest mistake of Frank's life...
3,0,1,No, by all means. Keep talking about 'Infinite Jest'.
4,1,0,Sheesh! You'd think nobody'd ever asked her for a double tall half-caf, ristretto mocha, no foam almond milk 170 degree latte in a Venti cup before!
4,0,0,A good title for your play would be Chicken a Little.
3,1,0,You know, I've had this ominous feeling all day.
4,0,0,Your turn to buy lunch, or mine?
3,1,0,I know...but I'm pretty sure if I ignore it, it'll just disappear.
3,0,0,I've had a lot on my mind , "I've had a lot on my mind, lately.
4,1,0,Yeah I get it. It's not like you've got to hit me with a brick!
2,2,0,Wish I could come up with a good excuse to get out of the dinner party my wife is throwing tonight.
4,0,0,Maybe just summarize, instead.
4,0,0,I really want the brisket, but I know I should get the kale.
3,1,0,Don't look now, but your ex-wife got a table upstairs.
2,1,0,I said, I can feel a headache coming on.
4,0,0,I don't believe honesty is the best policy.

4,0,1,And I told him flat out there was no way a trebuchet could hurl an object that far.
4,0,0,You must always be prepared for whatever life throws at you.
3,1,0,I guess I'm just a natural born optimist.
3,1,0,'Ahhhh....you know what Bob, I'll get the check next time'

3,2,0,I think you can quit counting calories.
2,1,0,I love my new attention deficit pills.
2,1,1,And that's my final word on the subject!
3,1,0,...and that's the story of how I, John Olerud of the Toronto Blue Jays, finally stopped wearing a batting helmet everywhere I went.

3,0,0,The ACME corporation is severing your services.
3,0,1,...and that's the last time I'm going to say that.

4,0,0,These to-go cups are so over engineered
4,0,0,No, I don't think women will ever break through the glass ceiling.
4,0,0,I think she heard that...
3,1,0,have you heard the one about those annoying life insurance salesmen
3,1,0,I'm starting to feel like a blockhead.
4,0,0,You told her she was built like a brick house?
4,1,0,Do you mind taking the check just this once?
4,0,0,Phillip, right now I dare say there are more urgent matters than to quibble over the amount of the tip.
5,0,0,He said I was a chip off the ole block.
1,2,0,Would you mind grabbing the check? I"ll get it next time.
4,0,0,Who knew the Road Runner Diner would be so realistic?
5,0,0,So you DON'T think now is a good time to sell?
5,0,0,Being agnostic just means that I don't worry so much anymore.

5,0,0,What a hangover. I feel like a brick hit my head!
5,0,0,THIS COFFEE IS TO DIE FOR
5,0,0,So here's something weird. Last week this street psychic told me, "Beware the Ides of March." I just saw him again and said, "Hey pal, the Ides are come." So, what does he say? "Aye, Julius, but not gone."
5,0,0,Is your toast burnt or am I about to have a stroke?
3,1,0,When I get an idea it comes out of the blue.
4,0,0,Just when he thought he could not take another minute of his co-worker's bragging, God intervened.
4,0,0,...so I say to him, 'What if there's no future? It's not like that's going to change anything.

4,1,0,That bagel's going to sit like a brick in your stomach.
2,2,0,Y’know, my ex lives in the walk-up above this place.
3,1,0,Nonsense. This place would be a great investment.
2,1,1,I mean... put yourself in my place.
3,1,0,So, I'm finally retiring this Friday...
4,0,0,I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.
3,1,0,What kind of diner doesn't offer a Grand Slam?
4,0,0,Then out of no where it hit me build it with cement blocks.
4,0,0,I rarely leave a tip
4,0,0,I wonder why they call this place "Bricks Fall"?
4,0,0,What did you say, I'm going to be getting a block grant?
4,0,0,Now that I finally signed it, what's next?
4,0,0,Think quick....One lump or Two
4,0,0,I need your input like a loch im kopf.
4,0,0,I might leave without paying.
4,0,0,I've got the best insider trading tip ever....
3,1,0,The odds of that are small
1,2,1,I'm serious-- that fast food is going to kill you.
3,2,0,Stop interrupting; let me finish...
3,1,0,I know this sounds strange, but sometimes I think Death is standing behind me, just staring.
3,1,0,No, you're wrong. It can't get any worse!
3,1,1,Don't look now, but there's a guy behind you who looks exactly like the Grim Reaper.
3,1,0,Before I can act on this I will need something more concrete.
2,1,0,I bet your next idea will hit you like a ton of bricks
2,1,1,Grow up Johnson, I'm not falling for that old, made you look, made you look gag
4,1,0,My boss is a real blockhead
3,0,0,And then the idea struck me like the weight of a pre-owned cinderblock.
2,1,1,What I'm about to tell you will change the world.
4,0,0,I hope I don't get sued for this.
2,1,1,I always sit here. It's my lucky table.
4,0,0,Wow...these things rarely come true.
3,2,0,Honestly, I've just been sitting around waiting for something to hit me.
5,0,0,Your horoscope was right. It said things would be falling in your lap today.
3,0,1,So I get fired, and then my wife leaves me. Could this day get any worse?

4,0,0,My analyst finally got me to quit worrying about things that are unlikely to happen.
3,0,1,I need another cup of coffee like I need a hole in the head.
4,0,0,Thank God it's Friday. It was just one of those weeks when nothing seemed to go right and you just feel glad to get out of the City in one piece.
3,1,0,The new building codes are really killing us construction managers.
5,0,0,A drone comes crushing down!
5,0,0,This coffee is gonna be like a hit upside the head!

4,0,0,Ellis, we live in a world governed by the laws of gravity.
3,2,0,I want my epitaph to read: 'He passed tort reform.'

4,0,0,Of course we're good to go! I can't imagine anything stopping this project
4,0,0,Stuart never should have ordered a flat white
4,0,0,What the? I ordered a scone, not a stone.

4,0,0,You really believe all of that new age good karma, bad karma crap?
4,0,0,If you keep eating like this you'll die an early death!
2,2,0,Do you think God will punish me for not leaving a tip?

1,3,0,I never tip here. Why do you ask?
2,0,0,I hope you're not in love with that rolex.
3,0,0,I hate Mondays.
5,0,0,I always think the worst can happen . . . people say I'm paranoid!
4,0,0,You have a bright future with our company
4,0,0,I will enjoy watching you die.
4,0,1,Speaking of "building blocks"......
3,1,0,Just give one single concrete example

2,3,0,This will wake me up.
2,1,0,So far so good!

3,0,0,Careful. The meals here are heavy.
4,0,0,Helen from upstairs said she just couldn't stand the thought of even one more lunch meeting this week, but I have a feeling it really had more to do with her feelings for me.
1,3,0,I didn't tip the barista. Why do you ask?

2,2,1,Just once I'd like to receive a "heads up" about something ahead of time.

3,0,1,I don't think this day could get much worse. Do you?
4,1,0,It doesn't seem like a serious threat. I'm sure it will fizzle out soon.
4,0,1,My business is bankrupt, I was indicted, my wife left me. . . even this coffee is terrible, . . what else could possibly happen?
4,0,0,No, I have nothing planned for tomorrow. Why do you ask?

2,1,0,I think there's something you're not telling me.
4,0,0,Pessimism is getting me nowhere.
4,0,0,Hey, why are you always calling me a blockhead?
4,1,0,Made an appointment with the lawyer for a will. Better late then never.

3,1,0,So I just wanted to give you a heads up on what's gonna go down, Murray.
4,1,0,You probably want that to go.
4,0,0,You know Bob, sometimes it feels like everything I build just crumbles.

5,0,0,did you forget to order the HARD HAT AREA signage?
3,1,0,All this caffeine is going to kill me one day.
3,1,0,And then the waitress said: "You want a flat white? I'll give you a flat white".
5,0,0,As to construction costs, I firmly believe that what goes up must come down.
5,0,0,We're making a little head way, "I think you're right".
4,0,0,Are you hungry? What made you think of duck?

5,0,0,Same old, same old.
3,0,1,There is nothing that you, or anybody else could say, that could stop me from voting for Donald Trump!
4,0,0,It's not too late to Yelp.

2,2,0,I see a promotion in my future
4,1,0,She just ended it, out of nowhere, it really hit me hard.

3,0,1,Are you even listening to what I'm saying?
3,1,0,Me? I'm good.
4,0,0,It doesn't take a ton of bricks to fall on me for me to see the writing on the wall.
4,0,0,Ever hear of Damocles?
3,0,1,All in all, I'd say things are looking up!

2,2,0,Would you please look at me when I'm talking to you?
3,0,0,Rest assured, there's no such thing as karma.

4,0,0,His plan to cement the deal was about to fail.
2,2,0,and all of the sudden it hit me....
2,2,0,No way Donald Trump's ever going to know I didn't vote for him.

3,1,0,Nothing more painful than a $7 cup of coffee
4,0,0,I think I see a problem with your logic.
4,0,1,Finish your drink and let's get out of here.
5,0,0,I'm under too much stress, like sitting under the Sword of Damocles,...or something.
5,0,0,So I told him he was too vague and I needed something more concrete.
4,0,0,I know you're not a Trump fan, but if I were you, I would move a little to the right..
5,0,0,My boss upstairs called me a blockhead. Why?
3,0,1,I wanted my burger bloody.
5,0,0,I support Trump because he's honest and will make this country gr--

2,3,0,What could go wrong?
4,0,0,Now whatcha gonna do with it?
3,1,0,no, I've stopped saying, "it hit me like a ton of bricks" 'cuz mostly, it wasn't true.

5,0,0,I need more bad luck like I need a hole in the head.
5,0,0,I should leave a big tip, shouldn't I...
4,1,0,Help me out, Benson. Lately, I've been feeling like a nameless speck in a practically infinite universe--the unintended butt of a poor cosmic joke of unknowable proportion.
4,0,0,I feel like, when the right idea comes to me, it will hit me like a ton of bricks.
4,0,0,That's one way to break the glass ceiling.
4,0,0,If I don't get some caffeine soon, I'm going to have such a headache.
2,2,0,I know I'm babbling...but really, I'm almost done.
4,1,0,You know what your problem is? You always expect the worst.

5,0,0,So as I was saying about Murphy's law...
4,0,0,Don't look now, but I think you are in deep trouble.
2,3,0,It looks good on paper Bob, but I'm going to have to sleep on it.
3,1,0,Finally, I am getting that promotion!
2,2,0,Personally, I think the phrase "hit you like a ton of bricks" is too cliche
3,1,0,I don't know... it's nothing concrete.
3,1,0,The answer literally hit me like a ton of bricks!
4,0,0,So, you think I'm going to turn into a Stone Head soon?
5,0,0,Did your doctor mention anything about how many months you have left?
2,1,0,So you're saying... there's something to that "Little Chicken" theory?
4,0,0,I feel I could be using my time more effectively.
4,1,0,Dan, they sky is falling back at the office, and I don't think casting your eyes Heavenward will get us the help we need!
4,0,0,Of course you're allowed to take the top off the latte. Why do you ask?

3,0,0,The most important thing in life is to have a lateral point of view.
4,0,0,So how's your life insurance policy?
2,0,1,If it's the last thing I say...
4,0,0,I'd still vote for him.
4,0,0,Didn't you used to be in insurance?
4,0,0,I bet you couldn't repeat that!

4,0,0,I don't think you fully appreciate the gravity of this situation.
4,1,0,Okay, I will purchase life insurance. Just please stop with the suggestive morbid stories.
3,1,0,Do I have a living will or a will to live?

4,0,0,My wife says I lack 'gravitas.'
3,0,0,Speaking of those wayward masons...
2,1,0,That concrete thing with big holes in it is called a cinderblock. Why?
4,0,0,Things have been looking up for me lately.
3,1,0,No, I don't think you have time for dessert.
1,1,1,I'm probably just being paranoid.
4,1,0,Is there anything else I can show you to convince you to buy this insurance policy?
4,0,0,My luck's finally changing. I think I'll bu....
5,0,0,I strongly dislike Modernist, interior design.

3,0,1,Seriously though, how can this divorce get any worse...
3,2,0,5, 4, 3, 2 ...
2,2,0,So my last boyfriend designed this place.
3,1,0,Could you be a little more descriptive other than "The sky is falling" ?
3,1,1,The waiter says he can cure my hiccups.
3,1,0,Some days, I just feel like the sky is falling
3,0,1,At least the sky isn't falling
3,1,0,I told you the Rueben's to die for.

5,0,0,Brick? Who's Brick?
4,0,0,I could have sworn I ordered a cinder block...
2,2,0,I think the worse is probably over.
4,0,0,I would need to see some concrete evidence that climate change is real before I act on policy.
3,0,0,Fate is just spiritual gloominess. I'm more of a concrete thinker.
4,0,0,...it doesn't necesarily have to be a TON of bricks...
2,1,0,I was just sitting there, and then that's when it hit me...
5,0,0,Don, best not to think about retirement.

4,0,0,Technically, he said it was hard as a rock.
5,0,0,Okay, know-it-all, how is it I could have gotten away with caffeinated today?
3,2,0,It all feels so heavy.
2,2,0,Frank give me something more concrete or the account walks.

3,0,1,Well, I've escaped the fallout so far.
2,2,0,Do you think the chef took it personally?
2,2,0,Of course, if you think you don't need life insurance..."
3,0,0,My doctor insists I take in more iron, but I really don't see how.
5,0,0,Hmm, If I pretend to sneeze maybe they will comp the bill.
3,0,0,Oh God, I was joking!
2,2,0,I just wish this dark cloud would lift.

4,1,0,I feel a headache coming on!
3,1,0,I don't know what else can go wrong.
4,0,0,Looks like you forget your wife's birthday again.

2,2,0,Sometimes I have to wait for the idea to hit me.
4,1,0,I've finally made my peace with the man upstairs.
4,0,0,I'm impressed...but what's the WOW factor.
2,2,0,As I was saying, the bottom 's gonna drop outta this.
4,0,0,Ugh, they used soy milk in my latte. Could this day possibly get any worse?
4,0,0,Your ideas are too abstract. I'm looking for something more concrete.
3,1,0,Fred ponders his opportunity for promotion.
3,1,0,I'm telling you, it hit me like a brick.
5,0,0,We need to go now!
0,4,0,Do you think I was too hard on the waitress?
5,0,0,Well yes, I have heard that the market is falling; but what has that to do with dailylife?
5,0,0,So do you really think this new blockchain technology is safe?

3,1,0,I wish I had something to look forward to.
4,0,0,I wanted to give you a heads-up.
5,0,0,His wife is quite a babe, no kids ...
3,0,0,Why is your hand in your coffee?
4,0,0,I told the waitress I wanted two lumps............
4,0,0,People are so surprised when the market crashes. But, like I always say, what goes up, must come down.
2,0,1,Probably best to keep the cover on your coffee.
4,0,0,No Frank, I'm inclined to believe there is a god.
4,1,0,I hear overhead is coming down.
5,0,0,Please don't tell me he's standing right behind me.
1,2,1,You never look at me anymore when I'm talking to you.
3,1,0,Nothing has helped me get over this writer's block.
4,0,0,For Christssakes, just sign off on the life insurance.
5,0,0,Watch out, a case of the Mondays is coming at you
3,1,0,I literally have only a second.
4,1,0,I feel lucky today
3,1,1,i need something stronger than coffee to get me going today

1,2,2,Did you know that UPS has started testing Delivery Drones for its deliveries to Construction Sites?
1,3,0,As long as there's no second panel, I'll be fine.
3,1,1,There may be some lingering resentment....

3,1,0,I feel like my life is just slipping away
3,1,0,My wife's lawyer is from Acme Suddenly Single.
5,0,0,I'm not sure why I stole your wife, something just came over me.

4,0,0,Lost my job,lost my wife. Huh. What else could happen?
3,0,0,and I was just thinking his day could not get any worse

3,1,0,Only divine intervention could screw up this deal.
2,1,1,Last night I solved the Goldbach conjecture.
4,0,0,That's enough, Jake. Everybody knows this is the best lunch place for blocks.

4,0,0,You'll just have to wait your turn because I am next in line for the chairman's job.
5,0,0,If I don't think about it , it'll hit me.
4,1,0,it's like nothing ever happens, you know ...

4,0,0,So what's up" "A headache
3,1,0,My advice is to live every moment like it's your last.
5,0,0,And, I have this really bad hangover...
2,1,1,The contracts are signed, what can possibly go wrong?
5,0,0,Hey, an idea just hit me like a ton of bricks.
4,0,0,Unlucky
4,1,0,and that should be the last thing on my list that's hanging over my head...
4,0,0,There's something to be said for a two ounce container.
4,0,0,Eleanor was saying just this morning that I'm so dense I wouldn't notice if I was hit by a brick.
4,0,0,Well, I do feel your pending sense of doom has some validity.
5,0,0,Another brick on the fall.
4,1,0,God, schmod.
4,0,0,Lunch with you is always a headache just waiting to happen.
4,1,0,About that meeting...I don't think we have to worry.
3,0,0,Of course, for a solid foundation, your concrete block is going to give you the best bang for the buck.
2,2,0,So, as soon as we get back to the office, I'm firing you.
4,0,0,You always breeze through life.
4,0,0,#Thatwillleaveamark
4,0,0,God damn it SIGN THE CHECK NOW!
3,0,1,And then the scene ended. Just like that.
4,0,0,Speaking of life insurance...

3,0,1,Stop with your paranoia, cinder blocks are not falling from the sky!
5,0,0,No. Really! MOVE!! NOW!!!
4,1,0,That brings us to item number six on your expense report...'cinder block booby-trap'. I'll have to disallow that as well!
4,0,0,Early promotion!
4,0,0,Lately, I can't come up with new material. I keep waiting for something to hit me.
3,1,0,Nothing is worse than being served stale coffee.
1,2,0,Do we have time to eat or should we take it "to go"?
4,0,0,Accidents will happen. Then again, Bob was a lousy tipper.

4,0,0,I mean really, what are the odds?
3,1,0,You just have to block out negative thoughts.
4,0,0,Hmmm. He does have a better parking space...
3,1,0,…barring an act of God, of course.
3,1,0,I think you should have said grace before eating.
3,0,0,I really feel like just a light lunch.
3,1,0,My day has been awful, so if you have bad news, don't tell me.
3,0,1,What? Do I have something on my face?
4,0,0,Surprises? I hate surprises.
4,0,1,As I stated earlier, you'll have the Vice President position over my dead body.
0,4,0,I took care of the bricklayers union, no prob
2,1,1,My broker says the bad news is finally behind us.
3,0,1,but, then, what else could go wrong
2,1,1,Im sorry our cutbacks at OSHA affected you.
3,0,1,I just never seem to catch a break. So how's the chicken, Little?
5,0,0,Do you ever wonder what changes you would make to your life if you knew the exact date and time of your death?
4,0,0,And after I confessed to her, it was as if a huge weight came off of my shoulders!
5,0,0,What? What's falling? The Dow?
4,0,0,Let me tell you, Bill, this place is a knock out!
4,1,0,Let's put this on your credit card.
1,2,1,Yes, I designed this building--but I don't consider it my best work.
3,1,0,Heck, if you ask me, that whole karma thing is a scam.
4,0,0,Choose Your Next Witticism Carefully, Mr. Bond.
3,1,0,I keep waiting for a sign . . .
3,0,0,I got a letter about an audit from the IRS this morning--talk about a crappy start to the day.
2,1,1,I'm sick of waiting for a sign from the universe.
3,1,0,I am looking forward to retirement. Why do you ask?
4,1,0,Sure, we can talk safely here.
4,0,1,Hey! Look here. The climate'll be just fine, and so will I.
5,0,0,I feel as if life is passing me by.
4,1,0,After admitting the shortcuts we took building this place, I feel like a great weight has been taken off my shoulders.
4,1,0,You can get "smashed" drinking this coffee!
4,0,0,Enjoy your sandwich... I having steak... I just wrote a $5,000,000.00 policy on this place... Effective at midnight tonight...
4,0,0,Hey -- thanks for the heads up.
4,0,0,I'm thinking of switching to decaf.
4,0,0,Not to worry - sensing impending disaster is my strong suit!
4,0,0,It's the extras. That's where they get ya!
3,1,0,I don't know about you, but I'm heading to the last roundup.
4,0,0,No, thanks. I've got enough insurance.
3,0,0,Now that I’m finally happy, I’m just waiting for the other concrete block to drop.
2,1,0,We're going to need a concrete plan.
4,0,1,Why the look, you know I like my coffee with just one lump.
2,1,1,Yes, I think she took it pretty well, but you know Marcie, it is hard to read her face at the best of times
2,1,2,Any final thoughts?
4,0,0,This place has great art.
3,2,0,Sure, the market's down. But at least the sky isn't falling.
3,1,0,Sure am glad the building inspector gave the okay.
3,1,0,And so my editor said, "Getting through writer's block's a breeze . . . something will hit you."
4,1,0,As you get older you realize that gravity always catches up to you.
3,1,0,This is most likely the worst idea we have ever had.
3,1,0,I don't know, Jim...I just keep waiting for a sign.
3,1,0,Are you just going to sit there and let this deal get squashed?
5,0,0,So you think I shouldn't have cancelled my insurance?
4,0,0,... and then I woke up.
1,3,0,I'd give anything to not have to go back to work today.
4,0,0,Now Trump Tower is falling apart too!
4,0,0,This time, I'm going to tip the waitress...What could happen?
4,0,0,It's supposed to help contrast the artificial lighting.
4,0,0,Why didn't you order something heavy?
3,0,0,When the boss called me into his office I thought I was getting promoted, but he just wanted me to sign "the sky is falling' waiver they're implementing soon...
4,0,0,I'd say Old Sal took the news of his “retirement” surprisingly well.
4,0,0,For the next campaign, I'm trying to come up with something that will really grab their attention.
3,1,0,.. and then it hit me like a ton of bricks.
1,2,1,So let me tell you about this horrible day I've had.
4,0,0,The food was a bit heavy, but the decor...
4,0,0,Guess I'm paying for lunch.
4,0,0,Fellow Yelpers - This diner is my favorite. The service is quick. The coffee is hot. And the banana muffins are super scrumptious. Minus one star for killing Doug with a cinder block.
2,2,0,Do you have any concrete suggestions?
4,0,1,How much time do we have?
3,1,0,still undecided?
2,2,0,So I used yesterday's cup to get a refill -- what are they going to do?
4,0,0,I tell you, if I was religious, I'd be looking for a sign.
4,0,0,At least the sky itself isn't falling!
4,0,0,Over my dead body am I going to keep what you just said off the record!
4,0,0,I always say, "eat less, live longer."
3,1,0,May the ceiling fall on me if this isn't a great deal!
5,0,0,I need some time off to get my head together.
4,0,0,You're a hopeless pessimist, Herb. You're always shouting the sky is falling.

4,0,0,It should be mind-boggling to see how Newton's 3rd law plays out over the next 10 seconds
3,1,0,I think it says ACME.
4,1,0,The company name is Damocles and Sons - we're branching out into construction.
3,0,0,I mean what's the worst thing that could happen ?

4,0,0,Destiny should be here any second for our meeting.
3,1,0,Karma?....Really?
1,1,1,Let me give you a concrete example.
4,0,0,Do you feel a draft?
2,2,0,Things are finally starting to look up.
4,0,0,I just discovered the cure for migraine headaches.
5,0,0,I desperately need a block buster idea!
4,0,0,Where is a block when you need it for your blockhead.
4,0,0,I'm out of ideas, Phil. I need something concrete to strike me.
4,1,0,Do you ever get the feeling that it's all tumbling down?
4,0,0,You don't always have to mimic me when I say things are starting to look up!
3,0,0,Can anything be worse than this coffee?

3,1,0,I'LL PICK UP THE CHECK NEXT TIME
2,1,1,And then it literally hit me...
3,2,0,'What's the metaphor I'm reaching for?'
3,0,0,Of course, I'm also concerned about how sea level rise, ten or twenty years down the road, will affect property values in SoHo and The East Village.
4,0,0,I need a metaphor for Trump.
4,1,0,Aha! I think we know why the building inspectors were outside.
5,0,0,Everybody hurts, Jim, but I’ve got a rash you wouldn’t believe.
3,1,0,Have you ever found yourself in a place where you feel you're just waiting for a sign?
3,1,0,God strike me dead if I'm lying
2,1,0,When the caffeine wears off it always hits me like a ton of bricks for some reason.
4,1,0,Yes, but why now?
4,1,0,I couldn't afford the sword.
3,0,1,Hell. Who knows how much time any of us have.
2,2,0,I don't believe in writer's block.
3,1,0,Isn't life just random?
5,0,0,Ever feel like God is out to get you?

4,0,0,Uh! I think you're right about that "feeling"!
4,0,0,To be or not to be. Should I let my boss live or die. That is the question. I know how Shakespeare felt. A dilemma.
4,0,0,A New Yorker never looks up.
4,0,0,Overcoming writer's block.
4,0,0,No. You're the schlemazel.
5,0,0,Like it or not, you're going to get a piece of my mind right now!
3,0,1,Uh… I wouldn't worry about the extra calories.
4,0,0,Did I get that on my suit? Oh man, nothing worse than a coffee stain, well maybe bloo...
3,1,0,So the punk cuts me off...
5,0,0,You have to give me proof the sky is falling.
2,2,0,I swear, there's nothing worse than a lid that doesn't quite fit.
5,0,0,Dammit, we've been found out.
3,0,0,Things are too good...I'm just waiting for the other cinderblock to fall, ya know?
3,1,0,Just a second, it'll come to me
4,0,0,Go for it! You could be hit by a bus.
4,0,0,I need something stronger to wake me this morning.
4,0,1,All morning I've felt this headache coming on.

1,2,1,It's the overhead that's gonna kill me
5,0,0,Your Double Down is here.

4,1,0,I just feel like I'm due for a life-changing experience.
4,0,0,It's been a really bad day.
2,1,0,Looks like my wallet is going to take a hit.
5,0,0,So he says, 'This isn't the last the Acme Corporation will hear of me!' and storms out.
4,1,0,Quick, make a wish.
5,0,0,No, I'm not worried. Her mason husband is totally clueless.
4,0,0,The last few weeks have been rough, Jim, but I think I've turned the corner.
3,1,0,Do you believe in second chances?
4,0,0,This is not your lucky day!
4,0,0,I don't think Acme would notice if we expensed this lunch.
5,0,0,If I don't get my coffee first thing, I could die.
4,1,0,... all of which leaves me searching for some kind of a sign.
4,0,0,How can I put it in more concrete terms?
4,0,0,Define random.
3,1,0,Have a pen...I'm ready to sign the life insurance policy.
4,0,0,It just feels like there's a huge weight on my shoulders

3,1,0,Decaf is better for ya
3,1,0,Mind if I take your desert?
4,0,1,Yes, my spirit animal is a coyote.
4,0,0,I mean, it was like it came out of nowhere.
3,1,0,When The Mets lost the series? It was the worst thing that could ever happen to me.
3,1,0,Pay attention, I am not going to repeat myself!
5,0,0,Let's figure out how to spin the vote.
4,0,0,Say, why would aliens abduct your hat?
5,0,0,I feel like I'm just waiting for the next big thing to hit me.
4,0,0,Well, the other shoe finally dropped. At least I know it can't get any worse.
5,0,0,I never catch a break

4,0,0,I need a sign from God
3,0,0,Believe me, you don't have to worry about it.

4,0,0,Heavy lunch, man. Feel like I'm going to knock out.
3,1,0,Yes, I do expect the unexpected.
4,0,0,They say it's raining cats and dogs. Next they'll be saying, cement blocks and shovels.
4,1,0,Gravity is only a theory.
4,0,0,I'm just relieved that the worst is over.
3,1,0,The occasional doughnut won't kill you.
4,0,0,There's a fly in this coffee. Ugh, my day is ruined!
3,1,0,... and then it hit me, like a ton of ...
3,1,0,My TED talk is - On the Job Braining.
4,0,0,Fred I just can't shake the feeling of doom
3,1,1,I am going to stop living in the future.
4,0,0,What do you mean, I'm a blockhead?
2,2,1,So I can finally enjoy a nice restaurant for lunch now that I've cancelled my life insurance premium.
1,2,1,The worst part is not knowing when the other shoe is going to drop.
5,0,0,It like with great ideas. Sometimes. BAMM. They just hit you out of nowhere.
4,0,0,From heedless to headless.
3,1,0,You're not gonna live to 50 eating all those breakfast sandwiches.
5,0,0,You won't be needing the cream or the sugar.
3,1,1,Didn't you tell her to use Dropbox?
4,0,0,Good,one less trump vote.
4,0,0,Almost ran over an actual Road Runner with my car on a business trip to Arizona last week. Those things are fast.
4,0,1,I'm told this place is an acquired taste.
3,1,0,We're going to hsve to stop eating here. This place is falling apart.
2,0,2,Oh, good, you see it, too.

4,1,0,I live each day as if it were my last.
4,0,0,Did you here about the comet coming real close to Earth?
4,0,0,Gosh, your horoscope was bang on.

3,0,0,Once I sign the papers, this whole block is coming down.
4,0,0,The 'what' of Damocles?
4,0,0,The tip is included, if I remember.
2,2,0,I can't think of anything that could stop Trump.
4,0,0,They have an excellent piano set in the evenings.
2,2,0,I'm finally feeling optimistic again about life.
4,1,0,Trust me, I'm capable of an open mind on this.
5,0,0,No, I haven't really ever thought about the fleeting nature of our existence. Why?
5,0,0,I'll pick up the check this time.
3,1,1,Finally, I feel like nothing is just hanging over me anymore.

5,0,0,Everyone is trying to keep me down.
4,0,0,That's Cinderblock Mixologist. Here, let me get you a business card.
2,2,0,I don't believe you see the gravity of the situation.
4,0,0,...and then it just hit me...
4,0,0,This industrial vibe is a little risky.
2,2,0,I'm sure glad we worked-out those problems with the unions.

4,0,0,I hope you're not bringing up something negative.
4,0,0,No, I don't think you DO need to worry that your 401(k) is falling like a rock...

3,1,0,Okay, I'll give you a concrete example.
3,1,0,So I told him, 'At least I'm not a construction worker...'
2,2,0,This should help me wake up.
4,1,0,…and the penalty for self-insuring is miniscule compared to the premiums I am avoiding in the long run.
3,0,0,I've got to stop imagining the worst - it's killing me!
1,3,0,I just don't feel like I have a future here
5,0,0,You'd better hurry up and drink that.

3,1,0,I thought it would be a shoe.
4,0,0,My beneficiary...why do you ask?
3,1,0,It's no secret. I take everyday as it comes.
3,1,1,Heads? What do you mean "heads"?
2,1,0,Whew...I can't wait for this week to be over...
2,1,1,It's been such a good week, I keep looking over my shoulder.
4,0,0,The waiters here seem a little chippy.
2,2,0,You know, Dave, people would like you more if you weren't such a Chicken Little.
3,1,0,Bert, I never remember...is it schadenfreude or schatenfreude?

4,0,0,Writer's block is the least of my worries.
4,0,0,And I was sure this cafe was rated 4 stars...
4,0,0,Trump has as much of a chance of wining the Republican nomination as a brick hitting me in the head at lunch.
4,0,0,And she just rags on and on with karma this, karma that...
5,0,0,Think this will be my last cup.
5,0,0,You have a better chance of being hit by a falling cinder block than winning Powerball.

3,1,0,Better luck next time Joe, they chose me for the position.
4,1,0,This is better. We can finally relax and enjoy a quiet cup of coffee.
3,1,0,What are the odds of that?
4,1,0,I'm sorry...did you just call me a block head?
5,0,0,Bottom Line, I think you need to up your life insurance!
3,1,0,Did I tell you my ex went back to school for masonry?
4,0,0,I have been trying to come up with a concrete solution for my problems
4,0,0,By my calculations, if I skip the daily donut, I'll live 1.363 years longer.
3,0,1,I wish I could get over this writer's block.

4,0,0,What you mean, stay woke
0,3,1,So, what's the BAD news?
2,1,1,Mark my words, all this doomsday talk just has to stop.
2,2,0,Like I said, the more concrete the better.
4,0,0,Another drone design flaw in the making
2,0,1,I'm going to splurge and order a Danish; it won't kill me!
4,1,0,Finally, everything is looking up for me.
3,1,0,Son, you may be my only heir,but you can't take over until you've learned to cut construction costs the way I have.
4,0,0,What?
3,1,0,My job is great, kids are great, wife is great life is really looking up
4,0,0,I can't remember exactly, but when I do..it's gonna hit me like a ton of bricks!!
3,1,0,Yeah, but you can get killed crossing the street.
4,0,0,So I told Mr Trump I couldn't vote for him.
3,1,0,Things have really fallen off around here.
4,0,0,As you can see, I always plan for all contingencies.

3,1,0,What'da you think about the new high-rises in the neighborhood?
3,0,0,Paying the check isn't going to be the only thing that hurts.
4,0,1,I hear cement futures are through the roof.
4,0,0,Matt was about to tell his friend he had bigger problems...
4,0,0,It's not the Sword Of Damocles that you should be worried about.
3,1,0,I finally told Barbara it's over.
4,0,0,Honestly Bob, I'm so confused right now I don't know whether I feel like I've been hit with a ton of bricks or a brick that weighs a ton.
4,1,0,Meyers and Jacoby originally met to discuss selling Amway.

4,0,0,Clean living, Thomas. The secret to a long life.
3,1,0,I just remembered the good news that I wanted to tell you.
3,1,0,If you see something, say something
4,0,0,I’ll grant you that occasionally NSA tactics lack subtlety.
5,0,0,This is not our usual power lunch Ted. I hired you for innovative and creative ideas, so far you've come up empty. It's time you come up with one good "concrete" idea, if not....I'm going to have to let you go.
4,0,0,Is it too late to order eggs? Cause this guy is about to get scrambled

4,0,0,Frankly, there have been days I've considered ending it all, but I never get a concrete sign.
5,0,0,I heard that a cup of coffee here buys you a seat for a short while. Wonder how they enforce it. I don't see bouncers.
3,1,0,'I can't escape the feeling that if I support Trump something terrible will happen.'
3,1,0,You know, I think you have to make sure a restaurant has banned tipping before you decide not to leave one.
4,1,0,I know exactly what you are going to say. I should not have whistled at that construction worker.
2,1,0,You may be experiencing a mental block.
2,1,1,All I know is that between getting fired and Mary leaving me, I don't think I can handle another crushing blow.
3,1,0,What lump ? Sugar's not good for me.
2,1,0,Lean forward a little, I'm having trouble hearing.
4,0,0,The gods are mad at us.
4,0,0,Things are starting to look up.
5,0,0,When at first you don't succeed...

4,1,0,On second thought, I wouldn't worry about that second spoonful of sugar..
4,1,0,I had an important point to make, but I didn't actually mean to hit you over the head with it.
4,0,0,I not a chin off the old block.....I CHIP THE BLOCK!
4,0,0,At least they finally spelled your name right.
5,0,0,Corner office in 3...2...
3,1,0,... and that's the truth, may God strike me dead.
3,2,0,You're really eating their heart attack special?
2,2,0,Can you give me something more concrete?
3,0,1,Now I believe in karma.
5,0,0,I still maintain that the theory of gravity is just a theory.
5,0,0,Looks like you picked the wrong day to quit drinking coffee!
4,0,0,This place is so quiet you can hear a pin drop.
3,1,0,I think they misinterpreted... on the rocks
5,0,0,We just need something more concrete to go on...
4,0,0,all this 'no tipping allowed' business, it's just un-American...
3,1,1,Did you forget to tip the barista?
3,0,0,Should we take this to go?
5,0,0,I wish I could afford a piano.
4,0,0,Ah, nice! No need to take a selfie.
3,1,0,I had the best dream last night…all my friends and family were celebrating at once.
4,0,0,CTE? Got it.
3,1,0,Are you going to finish that ?
1,2,0,Ever get the feeling some days that you're a brick shy of a load?
1,2,1,I don't see how today could get any worse.
4,0,0,I have a feeling this one is on me!
3,0,0,What kind of designer thinks hanging cinder blocks from strings is a good idea?
2,2,0,I've gotten rid of a millstone around my neck.

4,1,0,At first I thought that was pepper on my toast.
3,1,0,Life is short. Say yes.
5,0,0,It feels like I have a weight hanging over my head.
4,0,0,If Trump's another Bush then God will give me a sign!
3,0,0,Some people won't accept the truth unless it falls on their head like a brick from above.
1,1,1,My life's never been better, but I'm just worried other shoe's going to drop.
4,1,0,Sometimes I wonder if I should switch to decaf.
4,0,0,Remember those premonitions? My therapist is really happy with my progress so far.
2,1,1,Boy, I wish this day would end already.
5,0,0,Please focus.
4,0,0,I don't believe in waiting for the other shoe to drop.
2,2,0,Sometimes I feel like too much weight falls on my shoulders.
4,0,0,Trust me, I'll know it when I feel it.
4,0,0,Hate to be a wet blanket but I sense another decline.
4,0,0,Enjoy y... our coffee
4,1,0,For my inspection I'm giving this coffee shop a perfect rating for cleanliness and safety.
5,0,0,My hand has been in this warm water our entire meal and I still don't have to tinkle.
3,1,0,Did you read about the killer called the Cinderblock Shot Putter?
4,0,0,I can honestly say, at this point in my life, there really are no surprises left.
5,0,0,Cinder is like Tinder, but with real impact. You should try it!
4,0,0,Are you sure it wouldn't be too much to lend me $20 ?
4,0,0,Have you read "Things Fall Apart"?
2,1,0,It is never too early for to think about long term care health insurance.
4,0,0,What an interesting interior, using the optical illusion.
1,3,0,Duck? No, I'm leaning toward the chicken.
4,0,1,We should've tipped.
4,0,0,I can't shake the feeling that things are starting to look up.
1,1,3,So far the divorce has been surprisingly civil.
4,0,0,It's more than just my thoughts of impending doom that hinder me
3,2,0,This interview shouldn't take long.
4,0,0,Barrister's Conundrum: Warning or litigation?
4,0,1,No, I wasn't expecting a message from the Building Trades Council. Why?
4,0,0,Now why they call this a hard hat chai latte is beyond me.
2,2,0,Here is where I hid the money
3,0,1,I'm drawing a blank, but maybe something will strike me soon.
3,1,0,I feel writer's block coming on.
3,1,0,So I told her ‘Screw you and your Gypsy curse.’
4,0,0,I am not a blockhead!
5,0,0,I always thought he was the evil twin.
3,1,0,I think I'll take another lump.
4,0,0,The Internet trumps bricks and mortar every time!
3,0,1,You're always so Chicken Little
4,0,0,Well, at least it isn't a sword.
4,0,0,Did I mention I made partner?
3,1,0,I think your luck will change, in the other world.
4,1,0,Why do say it's ironic that I'm a building inspector?
1,2,1,The NFL is right. How do you really know if you got a concussion?
4,0,1,I am looking up.
5,0,0,They've already given me a heads up.
2,2,0,I believe you make your own luck in this world
0,2,2,Good news. I got my cholesterol down below 200.
5,0,0,We need a breakthrough.
4,0,0,No wonder this place only took six weeks to build.
3,1,0,Well, it's time to go.
4,0,0,So, that's why they call it the mobster specialty roast.
4,0,0,I feel my charka is blocked.
4,0,0,The money is at the...
4,0,0,Quick, once around the block.
3,0,0,"Really Ted, I have nothing against death".
3,1,0,I wish my hangover would end now!
5,0,0,I think I'm about to have an epiphany.
4,0,0,I cancelled my meeting with Chicken Little.
5,0,0,I see a concussion in your future...
4,0,0,Don't worry about any backlash from the Bricklayers' Union. They're pretty harmless.
4,0,0,I don't remember that being on the menu.
4,0,0,A writer's block is the least of your worries right now.
4,0,0,When's the deadline?
4,0,0,I can really feel a headache coming on.
3,1,0,Trump tower. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,Uh, at least it's not a ton of bricks.
3,1,0,Diners, drive-ins, and dies.
4,0,0,Construction... and you?
4,0,0,Actually, Bob, it's not going to be a shoe.
3,1,0,I hope this coffee helps me wake up.
4,0,0,Why should I care about our crumbling infrastructure?
4,0,0,As I live and breathe
3,1,1,Something, anything, to break the routine.
2,1,1,So she says, 'one lump or two?'
2,0,1,Bob, at the risk of sounding like a new feminist, I think you should lean in.
3,1,0,George, this may be your last breakfast.
4,0,0,Good thing Quantum Mechanics doesn't occur on the macroscopic scale.
4,0,0,When I confessed my latest dalliance to the wife, she became eerily silent.
3,1,0,Sure I'm unfaithful, manipulative and possessive, but like Jesus said: let he who is without sin cast the first...
2,0,0,You know how sometimes, it just feels like one of those days?
3,1,0,Do you think she will contest the divorce?
3,0,1,I had a real bad day at the office....
4,1,0,trust me, dude, a Trump candidacy is gonna be great for the Democrats
4,1,0,Let me tell you, it's been a hell of a day!
3,1,0,I can't believe that tomorrow is finally my retirement day.
2,1,1,Just once, I wish a lunch meeting would end with something concrete.
3,1,0,....and that's the gist of it. Oh, and to top it off....
4,0,0,You might want to take your coffee to go.
5,0,0,Oh, .... just another 'faux pas' from Trump Construction.
4,0,0,So, I’m talking to that annoying Chicken Little life insurance guy, and he acts like I could be sitting somewhere, minding my own business, and get killed by a falling cinder block or something.
2,1,1,I pray to God someone cures my migraine.
3,1,1,Do you think I tipped enough?
4,0,0,I have a feeling that it is not going to hit me like a ton of bricks.
4,0,0,This will certainly outweigh the benefits of the all day breakfast menu, I'm afraid.
5,0,0,"Dude, Please tell me your name is Neo and that we are in the Matrix".
5,0,0,What could possibly go wrong?
1,1,3,I'm learning to just live in the moment.
3,0,1,Go Trrrrrrrrrrrrump!!!
2,1,1,We were lucky to get a table.
3,1,0,Not getting that promotion hit me like a ton of bricks, but I'm optimistic things are going to change now.
2,2,0,Duck?! For lunch?
5,0,0,And then the idea hit me like a load of brick.
4,0,0,Do I have good health insurance? Why, arevyou shooting a commercial?
5,0,0,"Whoa...gotta-go: it looks like another one of those,''cinder-block from space'' moments here. But, hold that thought...''
3,0,0,I feel like I've finally gotten rid of that dark cloud that's been hanging over my head.
3,2,0,Can you explain quickly why you're rescinding your life insurance offer?
3,1,0,Eating those fast food burgers will kill you.
3,1,0,Now's a good time to sign that insurance policy.
5,0,0,Tell me, what exactly is a writers block ?
3,2,0,Medicare. Why?
4,0,0,You know, I've been trying to understand this mental block.
4,0,1,Please hold that thought.
4,0,0,And what's your view of the futures markets right now?
3,1,0,You can't go wrong with whole life insurance.
3,1,0,She keeps telling me I need be more spontaneous.
5,0,0,They say these things happen in threes, so....
3,0,1,What time did you say your ex-wife was dropping off your stuff?
5,0,0,then I told her she needed to let go of what was weighing on her mind...
4,0,0,Here comes the bill and it's a biggie.
2,1,1,Ok, so....big deal, God plays dice with the universe.
4,0,0,And what if instead of a great watchmaker we had a giant bricklayer?
3,2,0,Brick and mortar stores are a thing of the past.
2,1,1,You know, Frank, I don't know how this week could get any worse.
3,0,0,She left me and my world came crashing down around me.
4,0,0,Tell me your password -- QUICK!
3,1,0,"I think I'm getting that two o'clock drowsiness."/
4,0,0,So if anything should happen to me, knock on wood, you'll be set.
3,0,1,.. She says she won't. He says he will. But what we really need, is a sign from above
5,0,0,Do you think I need to post a new Tinder photo?
3,1,0,I have this sudden urge for a Fig Newton.
3,1,0,Son, I've got your back.
3,1,0,Insurance?Why?
3,1,0,Fred was discussing his writers block with his editor when it suddenly hit him.
2,2,0,Can you give me something that is more concrete?
5,0,0,On second thought, don't buy. Sell.
4,0,0,Are you paying attention?
4,0,0,Ever had that feeling of impending doom?
4,0,0,You really need to look at equities in the long term.
3,1,0,Can you pass the salt?
2,2,0,My headache is finally gone!
3,1,0,I can't understand you when you have food in your mouth.
4,0,0,I don't know, it's just this vague since of foreboding.
4,0,0,I read recently that coffee may decrease your risk for premature death.
5,0,0,Its all part of being a New Yorker
4,1,0,Things are gonna get worse before they get better.
5,0,0,Duck! Ah, too bad...share your coffee?
2,3,0,And then it hit me...
4,0,0,He serious, bro. They're tearing down Trump Tower for salvage wall blocks.
3,1,0,Are you using "brick" figuratively?
4,0,0,I've heard that readymade art involves taking risks but this is absurd.
5,0,0,That coffee will knock you out!
4,1,0,Hang on, it'll come to me in a just a sec...
2,1,1,This interview is over.
4,0,0,If the general election is like the primaries, you might as well kill me now.
3,0,0,Gravity my friend is just a theory
4,0,0,Do you ever feel like something bad is about to happen?
4,0,0,I feel like I'm coming down with something
2,2,0,You may not need the jolt from your coffee.
4,0,0,You're right, every day is what you make of it.
3,1,0,Do you think I should have tipped the barista?
4,0,0,Live fast, don't fret about gluten
3,2,0,Good to the last drop!
4,0,0,Incoming
4,0,0,You're nuts, Luck has nothing to do with our success
4,1,0,I have this ominous feeling -- like someone's watching me through the window.
3,1,1,Sometimes I just need a wake-up call.
4,0,1,I'm expecting a little something from my ex
3,0,1,Why don't you sign now so we can relax over dessert?
3,1,0,Bill, can you pay attention when I am talking to you?
3,1,0,Let's cement the deal.
4,0,1,... and if I'm lying, may I be struck down from above.
4,0,0,I may have to rethink my position.
5,0,0,Golf next weekend?
4,1,0,MetLife. Why do.....?
2,0,2,I'm thinking about cutting back on the caffeine.
4,1,0,I think things are finally falling into place.
4,0,0,Did you order off the menu?
1,3,0,Eat up. They discourage lingering.
4,0,0,When haven't I kept my head under pressure!
5,0,0,My lunch here always reminds me of Chicken Little.
4,0,0,I don't know ... things just come to me.
3,2,0,I'm probably going to get fired. Just kill me now.
5,0,0,Brady's better than Manning? What are you, a block head?
2,1,1," I just don't seem to be able to get out from under".
2,2,0,I just wish something new and exciting would happen to me.
2,1,1,Carl is oblivious to the best selfie moment he will ever have.
4,1,0,Give me a second. Maybe something will come to me out of the blue.
4,0,0,all in all it's just another cinder block from the sky
2,2,0,It's just been one headache after another.
5,0,0,Be proactive. That's my motto.
3,0,0,I give you five minutes to accept my proposal.
3,0,0,Interest rates? I've never been good at predictions.
3,1,0,Between a falling brick and this coffee? I'd take the brick.
5,0,0,Hey Joe. You know that brilliant idea of yours? I took credit for it with the boss, and I'm getting a raise.
3,1,0,Anything else, my time's about up on the meter?
1,3,0,And I finally paid off my student loan this week.
3,1,0,Let me get it this time.
4,1,0,I never get chosen for anything.
4,0,0,Yes, I'm Nick Damocles. And Frank Dionysius is now a mason. What of it?
3,1,0,You know how they say "Don't look down"?
4,0,0,Let's skip dessert!
2,2,0,So I didn't make partner this time around. But I believe everything happens for a reason.
2,0,1,How's the market today?
2,2,0,So I said, “Of course I’ll take it as an annuity. “
5,0,0,Mike, I'll take care of the bill. My ex's alimony check will be delayed.
3,1,0,Mel? It's not the sugar that's gonna kill you...
4,0,0,This day can only get better after a morning like that.
3,1,0,Trickle-down briconomics??!
4,0,0,I can't shake this sense of impending doom.
3,1,0,Speaking of our business plan, did I mention building blocks?
4,0,0,Will you at that? The train is on time. I think we have to end our session.
2,0,0,I'm going to stop being such a pessimist .
4,0,0,You wish you knew about being creatively blocked.
3,1,0,Should I sign now or later?
4,0,0,I thought you ordered over easy
4,0,0,Better hope what's styrofoam?
4,0,0,Did you order an anvil?
4,0,0,I just adopted a little chicken.
4,1,0,And it was then that Bob realized what could be worse than missing the seasonal decorations on his coffee cup.
4,0,0,I said CMU! Not "See, I'm like you".
3,1,0,As I was saying, I can't imagine anything worse will happen to me.
4,0,0,Over my dead body will I ever agree to that!
3,1,0,Hey. You Know How Sometimes Things Just Fall In Your Lap?
4,0,0,It's the slab again, right?
3,0,1,I keep telling her I'm overinsured.
4,0,0,Don’t worry, nothing bad happens in cartoons
3,0,0,My plans aren't set in concrete.
5,0,0,If it's a sin to support Trump...
3,1,0,If this isn't the best retirement plan for you, may God strike me dead!
3,0,0,I recommend we bump up your insurance a bit.
4,0,0,You won't need to go to that meeting this afternoon.
0,3,1,I will e-mail your raise and the promotion to HR this afternoon.
1,2,1,Do we have time for dessert?
3,1,0,Somebody put me outta my misery already!
3,1,0,I insist! You can get the next one.
4,0,0,Seriously...Tom...it isn't like the sky is going to fall
4,1,0,This latte better be worth it.
4,0,0,I'll never understand FOMO. If I'm meant to be somewhere, I'll be there.
4,0,0,I'm not so sure everything happens for a reason.
1,0,3,Roses. Why?
3,0,1,You know what they say. 'In politics, nothing happens by accident.'
2,0,0,Fore I think you are going to have a headache today! Trump's punishment for having coffee! Incoming - Cement Block You are such a Block Head! Construction Zone Where is OSHA when you need them? Damn, I forgot my Hard Hat today!
3,1,0,You seem preoccupied.
2,1,0,Whole milk has too much cholesterol, but I figure what the hell.
4,0,0,Mother's dead. It's time I came out.
2,2,0,I finally paid off my student loans. Things are really looking up!
4,0,0,I just have so much on my mind.
3,1,0,I just feel this great weight coming down on me
3,1,0,And if my plan crosses some moral line, let God throw a brick.
3,0,1,Catch a falling brick, and put it in your briefcase. Save it for a rainy day.
3,1,0,Labeling her a stalker would be an understatement.
1,2,1,Yeah, I walk under ladders. So what?
4,0,0,It seems we've run into a brick wall on this issue.
3,1,0,Nope, I don't see duck on the menu.
2,2,0,You mean concrete block; cement is just an ingredient.
4,0,0,I didn't know this happened in real life.
4,0,0,Well, I guess I'll be stuck with the bill.
4,0,1,For once, I'd like to get a concrete answer.
4,0,0,I'm on a crash diet.
3,0,1,Sorry! I cannot renew your policy.
3,0,0,Want to know the secret of life?
2,2,0,I'm surprised we finally closed the deal. My horoscope said I was going to encounter a huge stumbling block today.
4,0,0,Trust me: we'll survive the next housing crash.
3,1,0,I just don't see the need for that long term care coverage.
4,0,0,Getting that promotion has been a weight off my shoulders.
1,3,0,I'm wondering what will hit next.
3,0,1,Blockhead yourself, numbskull.
3,1,0,My physician said the muffins are hazardous to my health.
5,0,0,Don't say anything- cartoon law says it won't fall on me if I don't look.
3,0,0,I'm having trouble thinking of an appropriate metaphor for a Trump presidency.
4,0,0,When the reality of Bernie Sanders nears you!
3,1,0,Are you paying with cash?
4,0,0,Maybe I should have brushed up on my language skills before ordering in Italian.
3,1,0,Should I unfriend Milton or block him? #heavy
4,0,0,These new figures are going to hit the guys in finance like a ton of bricks.
3,1,0,This is a write off, right?
3,1,0,I'm repeating myself for the last time, understand pal?
4,0,0,You didn't hear it from me, but the person who's been stealing the paper clips is—
4,1,0,You're right. There's nothing you can do.
4,0,0,Righto! Now we just wait for the other shoe to drop.
2,1,1,I'd better be getting home before it rains.
4,0,0,Hmm. There seems to be a leak.
3,1,1,I regret calling him a blockhead, but he doesn't seem to harbor any ill feeling.
5,0,0,I guess you really were dying to see me!
3,1,0,And if that wasn't enough, out of the clear blue sky she calls me a blockhead.

3,1,0,Today's my lucky day, I just feel it.
5,0,0,So, like I was saying, you gotta live everyday as if it were your last.
4,1,0,Did you see the way that old gypsy looked at me?
4,0,0,Unless I get something like . . . I don't know . . . a sign from on high or something . . . I'm definitely voting for Trump!
4,0,0,Tell me again about your proposal for using Legos for our remodeling needs
5,0,0,Edison bulbs are experimental enough for me.
4,0,0,I just know I'm gonna be blocked.
4,0,0,I will give you one minute to accept my idea.
2,1,1,Damn! She made my skinny latte with 2%.
4,0,0,Opposing Trump might be dangerous.
3,2,0,Speaking of last minute things.
4,0,0,WHAT ? NEVER MIND ?
5,0,0,Happy Hour ends at the drop of the clock in this joint.

3,0,1,I sense a concrete threat to your well-being.
3,2,0,Do you believe in destiny or free will?
2,3,0,Don't worry, they won't come after you unless something happens to me.
3,1,0,Sometimes you're just sitting there innocently and a brick falls on your head...
3,1,1,I can't imagine anything worse than Trump.
3,0,1,Thirty-two feet per second. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,Thst's some concrete evidence there Ed, but no foundation to support it
2,1,1,just give me something concrete to go on...
2,0,0,Do you take anything in your coffee?
5,0,0,So you say you broke a mirror this morning?

4,0,0,Regardless of who wins, I'm not moving.
3,0,0,I try to stay in the moment.
4,1,0,Did you tell me that you wrote a rather scathing article about Trump on Facebook!
4,0,0,God swiped left.
5,0,0,Sorry, my minds made up! Only God himself, could get me to not vote Trump.
4,1,0,Life's a brick: you get laid and run into a wall.
4,0,0,You're right! Life is not fair!
5,0,0,Just out of curiosity, are your life insurance premiums paid up?
3,1,0,Boy, have I had a rough day!
4,0,0,Oh, that ... the Cinderblock of Damocles. And to think how damned happy I was when they finally named me chief of construction operations.
4,0,0,What karma?
4,0,0,Unfortunately, there was only one way to get Sidney to stop talking.
5,0,0,I'll try it. What's the worst thing that could happen?
4,0,0,I hate to tell you this, but...

2,1,0,May a brick fall from the sky and kill me should Trump become President
4,0,0,I really dodged a bullet at the meeting this morning.
5,0,0,I feel like I'm not seeing something here.

3,1,0,I'm telling you, there's no such thing as fate.
2,2,0,Things are looking up for my promotion.
4,0,0,"Worldstarr".
4,0,0,Take it from me, the market is about to fall.
4,1,0,And that's my final offer
4,1,0,Some days I don't feel like getting up.
4,0,0,I can't imagine anything worse than falling stock prices and a market crash right now.
2,2,0,The offer's fine, but Acme takes its noncompetes pretty seriously.
2,1,1,Ironically, I feel a great weight has been lifted from me.
1,2,0,Everything's up in the air.
3,2,0,My treat.
5,0,0,I have two nanoseconds to work on my surprise face
4,0,0,I told him straight out, "You ever want to get ahead in this company? Surprise me."
3,0,0,No I don't know why they're called "cinder blocks." I think they're made out of something much heavier. Why?
3,1,0,No, that is just a bad idea.
4,0,0,This place always gives me a headache.
3,1,0,I was thinking of ordering the souffle.
5,0,0,If they forget the sugar again, I swear the sky is gonna fall down.
2,0,1,So, I'm worried about my cholesterol...
3,1,0,I really don't see why we should raise the minimum wage.
4,0,0,I agree with you on that stock. I really can't see any downside risk to me at all.
4,0,0,My mind's gone blank--It'll hit me!
4,1,0,Williams quickly regretted calling his colleague an ignorant blockhead.
3,1,0,This meeting was just to give you a heads up.
4,1,0,Sign Here, Quick!
3,1,1,Then again, it's not the end of the world.
3,1,0,You know it's nothing concrete or anything but lately I just haven't been able to shake this sense of impending doom
2,0,1,You know, this coffee is good to the last drop...
4,0,0,Natural Selection in the 21st Century
4,0,0,Then my insurance agent heaven forbid that...
4,0,0,I'm looking forward to an early retirement.
3,1,0,Did Amazon mention they would be delivering your order by drone?
2,1,1,Why the long face?
3,1,0,Not a peep, just relax and take a sip. You're worry too much.
2,1,0,I've been thinking of trying a flattop.
4,0,0,I wanted your input because you are always seeing things before other people do.
5,0,0,That guy's no better than some coyote, and we're gonna just crush him…
4,0,0,That's surprising. You usually don't kid around about things like that.
2,2,0,We're thinking of canceling our plans for Europe this summer. Just too dangerous.
4,1,0,I take my coffee with one lump.
3,0,1,I'm telling you Harry, there really is a secret cabal of all powerful elitists inflating the price of bricks and mortar for their own nefarious gains...
2,2,0,Well, we're just one block away from the hospital.
2,1,0,This has been my best sales day ever.
3,2,0,You seem distracted. What's up?
3,1,0,Seriously Ted , after the morning I've had what on earth could possibly go wrong now?
4,0,0,Don't look now or you will have a broken nose.
3,0,1,Can't wait for this day to be over.
3,2,0,Everything is falling into place after we cut that outrageous construction budget.
4,0,1,I'm just not one of those 'the sky is falling' types.
4,0,0,You just never know, do you, Kevin?
3,1,0,I've completely hedged all my market risk to avoid the proverbial Black Swan.
3,1,0,Speaking of blockheads...
3,1,0,Let me see if I can make my comment short enough.
4,0,0,Can you make any sense of existentialism?
4,0,0,What's all this about ceiling infractions?
3,1,0,I'm not going to be able to keep this deal open for much longer.
4,0,0,Hum, you know Harry, I 'll get the check today.
4,0,0,In Soviet Russia, brick smokes you!
4,1,0,I'm so tired of all this Chicken little, the-sky-is-falling nonsense...
3,0,0,I've always been more of a lego man.
4,0,0,It's true, nothing ever falls my way.
2,1,0,And after all that, I won the lottery. Isn't it ironic?
3,0,1,I need concrete proof.
2,2,0,Why would you ask if I have life insurance?
3,1,0,I feel like big things are coming my way.
2,1,0,And then she told me I would die a terrible death.
2,2,0,Two words, Phil, "whole-life".
1,2,2,Nothing could make this day worse for me.
3,1,0,Do you ever get a strange feeling that someone you really care about is in grave danger?
2,3,0,I feel like things are finally looking up.
3,1,0,My coffee's cold !
2,1,1,My ex keeps telling me I should try this place.
4,0,0,Whatever I got, this chai tea should knock it out.
4,0,0,So when she told me she wanted a divorce I thought it would hit me like a ton of bricks but nothing happened.
2,1,1,I'll be there, barring the unforeseen.
3,1,0,Give me a second and it'll hit me.
2,2,0,My wife says I worry too much.
4,0,0,Maybe you shouldn't have taken His name in vain.
3,1,0,This crick in my neck is killing me!
4,1,0,Hold on a sec, I want to Instagram my coffee.
4,0,0,Illegal immigrants, radical terrorists, bad trade deals... It can't any worse, can it?
2,2,0,There is no way my day could get any worse.
3,1,0,There's that look again, like there's something your not telling me.
4,0,0,The coffee here gives me a major headache!
5,0,0,Oh, that reminds me. I need to get that insurance app for my Phone.
2,2,1,Sometimes I think things can't get any worse.
5,0,0,I'm having an affair with a hard hats wife.
3,0,0,Nothing literally ever happens to me.
1,3,0,Please consider that I'm--not--speaking metaphorically
5,0,0,The streets just aren't safe anymore.
4,0,0,I'm wanting for signs that the housing market collapse.
5,0,0,Timber!!!
2,1,0,Don't worry, something will hit me.
1,2,2,You mean that figuratively, of course.
4,0,0,Industrial design is one one thing, but it's getting a little out of hand.
4,0,0,A ton of bricks falling on me, or just a cement block. My fantasy sometimes seems so real.
5,0,0,My divorce is creating a big headache.
3,1,0,I finally got my cholesterol down.
2,0,0,No way. My mind doesn't work like that.
4,0,0,Johnson, where's piece B21?
4,0,0,How did it happen? I don't know....I was just having a cup of coffee, minding my own business, and suddenly it hit me.
4,0,0,I think your triple "rev me up" espresso was a poor investment.
2,1,1,Karma schmarma.
4,0,0,So now that I've overcome that block everything is looking up.
3,1,0,I like one lump with my coffee.
4,0,0,What do you mean by "clear signs of another imminent real estate bubble crash"?
2,1,0,Let's not rush our discussion.
4,0,0,Are you building a bookcase?
5,0,0,Finally, things seem to be falling into place.
3,0,0,I don't think you should have passed on the dessert.
3,1,0,They forgot the whipped cream again. Could this day get any worse?!
4,0,0,Remember that insurance policy we discussed?
4,1,0,That gluten is going to kill you.
4,0,0,I said hey, I don't need a brick to fall on my head.
4,0,0,Do YOU know why they call it 'the concrete jungle'?
3,0,0,Guess its my turn to be C.E.O.
3,2,0,One more wouldn't hurt
4,0,0,I used to think only blockheads ate here.
3,0,1,So, I told her to drop it.
4,0,0,We need some concrete proof to cement our case.
5,0,0,You're right, life is short. I should have requested the porcelain cup.
4,0,0,What do you think is the side with the Mason's Special?
4,1,0,I'm really glad you picked this place.
2,2,0,Is there anything worse than when they don't get your coffee right?
4,0,1,No caffeine at all... it gives me a headache
3,0,2,Then she said, "You're always so clueless."
4,0,0,Sh.h.h!....don't say a word!
4,0,0,Perhaps I should have left a tip?
4,1,0,You may be right about the bad luck you've been having.
4,0,0,This place doesn't knock me out.
4,0,0,Did you hear that the North Koreans are working on a catapult?
4,1,0,Do you think I should change my Tinder selfie?
4,0,0,Yes. I'm still a glass-is-half-full guy. Why do you ask?
3,0,0,I know that there must be an answer out there somewhere
2,2,0,Nothing's going to stop me. I am switching to decaf.
3,0,0,"So I thought, and thought, and thought, and then . . . . .
4,0,0,Nope, haven't been to church in years. My wife says I'll get struck by lightning
3,2,0,I didn't realize it was an actual drop ceiling
4,0,0,They must think we're blockheads.
3,1,0,You really should have got the cappuccino its to die for!
2,2,0,Cheryl and I, we've got it all figured out.
5,0,0,Your infrastructure appears to comply with deregulated standards.
3,2,0,You're such an unhealthy eater.
4,0,0,I just signed my divorce papers, and boy do I feel free.
3,0,1,Things are looking up for me too.
4,0,0,I think it's the opportunity of a lifetime.
4,0,0,You can’t go around thinking that the roof is going to fall on you.
5,0,0,I am sitting In the morning At the diner ..Uh Oh..
2,0,1,If they ran out of liver wurst again, just kill me now.
3,0,1,Relax. Things will fall into place for you very soon.
4,0,0,I don't think I got the job. They said they were looking for someone who is excellent at abstract thinking.
3,1,0,We're developing the air rights.
2,2,0,So, Wilson, as long as I'm senior partner, your fat bonus is guaranteed.
4,0,1,Pretend it's not there.
1,3,0,I'll sign power of attorney over to you when we get back to the office.
5,0,0,I really appreciate you blocking out some time to meet for lunch.
4,0,0,This coffee isn't strong enough.
4,0,0,Henry, let me tell you the story why I always sit under this hanging art installation.
4,0,0,I was going to say lunch is on me, but somehow I don't think that's going to happen.
3,0,0,If a cement block falls in the diner . . .
4,0,0,He's not Mr. Trump.
5,0,0,Why yes, I do have a bottle of Advil on me. Why do you ask?
2,1,1,my attorney guarantees a simple, concrete solution
4,0,0,Watching you caffeine? A "Venti" wouldn't kill you, you know.
3,2,0,I'm ready to let go of the victim role.
5,0,0,You never know, maybe I'll win the lottery.
4,1,0,All I asked was if they liked 'Kinky Boots'.
4,0,1,This conversation is over.
4,0,0,And to think we almost got the table by the kitchen door.
3,0,0,I should have wished for a million dollars.
4,0,0,The problem with these Millenials is that they never want to start on the ground floor.
3,0,1,Cinder what ?
4,0,0,Fred, I'm going to miss these morning coffee breaks.
4,1,0,And that's why I've always been really lucky in life.
4,0,0,You won't believe what that blockhead said then
5,0,0,Well the good news is that it looks like I'm not gonna have to pay for my lunch...
5,0,0,No idea has ever hit me like a hit by a ton of bricks. One cement block is usually enough.
4,1,0,It's just one sugary soft drink. What's the worst that could happen?
3,2,0,I worked my whole life to get where I am right now
4,0,0,Last week was a headache, but now I'm looking at the upside.
2,3,0,You gotta live in the moment, Stu.
3,1,0,I agree - the overhead is a definite liability.
5,0,0,Look, Mr. Trump is absolutely sincere. May I be struck ----
2,1,1,Any idea why they call it “The Sadist’s Surprise Café”?
2,1,0,Gentrification always brings some collateral damage.
4,0,0,Phew! Good thing he already picked up the tab.
4,1,0,Let me get the check this time.
4,0,0,I could see it coming, Harry, but you didn't believe me...
3,0,0,Have you ever considered switching to decaf or artificial sweeteners.
3,1,0,I need a reason stronger than Trump to abandon the Republican party.
5,0,0,I can't take the guilt any more. I've been seeing your wife.
4,0,0,Check, please.
4,0,0,don't look up. we are going to be crush. "pray for wings"
5,0,0,I don't know, I just seem to have this weight on my shoulders.
2,1,0,So I said to my wife, sometimes things get worse before they get better.
4,1,0,On second thought, I think I will upgrade my life insurance policy
1,2,0,I just feel I need something more concrete
3,1,0,BAM and then it hits you
3,0,1,So Clinton, Trump and Cruz walk into a bar...
4,0,0,Rather than listening to me, you have your head in the clouds.
5,0,0,Waiter ? There's a cement block in my soup.
4,0,0,Then this Lucy said, 'Charlie Brown, you ...'.
3,0,0,I don't think you need to bother ordering lunch.
2,2,0,32 feet per second, per second...
4,0,0,You know, I'm no longer feeling light header.
1,1,0,I'll buy lunch today.
4,0,0,I make $60 an hour working from home...
2,0,2,O.K.....I'll pick up the tab next time.
4,0,0,Audited?! He's gonna shi...
3,0,1,I only drink strong coffee when I sense a headache coming on.
2,2,0,I get the worst headaches since I switched to decaf.
4,1,0,...so I told her "you think a brick layer can make you happy?!"
3,0,0,I then I told her, may God strike me dead. And she believed me.
1,2,1,Listen, life insurance is obsolete.
3,1,0,Relax... I hate pushy insurance salesmen.
3,1,1,If I could only have a sign...
5,0,0,... and I have no overhead.
1,2,0,Mindfulness allows me to live each day as if it were my last.
4,1,0,No, I don't think a little coffee is going to kill you.
5,0,0,Did you ask for one lump or two?
2,1,0,I sense some push back from our contractor
4,0,0,You ever get the feeling the world is closing in on you.
4,0,0,And you never know....A giant cinder block could come crashing down out of the blue.
4,0,0,I pushed the project to Phil.
4,0,0,I've been feeling flat lately.
5,0,0,You know you said,"nothing exciting happens"
4,0,0,I've never felt so fulfilled
4,0,0,Clairvoyant, schmervoyant, she was clearly deranged...
4,0,1,It's a Venti half caff, 3 1/3 shots long, 6 pump chai 3 pump vanilla spice, half lactose half soy 190 degree green tea misto. Why do you ask?
3,0,1,My turn buy, right?
4,0,0,Sorry my mouth is full.
1,2,1,Sure, we can leave anytime. Why?
3,1,0,So, when Concrete Union #61 threatened to strike, I said "Go right ahead," and I hired a platoon of scabs in two flicks of a trowel.
4,1,0,That's about as likely as getting hit on the head by a cinder block.
2,1,1,Thank you for making me your beneficiary
4,0,0,Don't worry, my ex-wife doesn't know that I am a Superhero
3,1,1,I just don't feel a thing until I have my first cup of coffee
3,1,0,It's impossible to imagine this day getting any worse.
4,0,0,I may finally get some peace and quiet now...
3,0,1,Maybe it's me but lately I just feel like a target.
3,1,0,Now where did I put that cinderblock?
4,0,0,I wish I could think of a way to block my transfer to Omaha.
3,1,0,You have a point, Fred, but we need to think long term.
4,0,0,I just know something is about to drop.
4,0,0,Give me a second.
4,0,0,My horoscope says I'll get word from higher-ups today.
5,0,0,So I asked myself, what's the worst that could happen?
2,1,1,Great business; but its the overhead that kills you!
2,2,0,We should have left a tip last time.
4,0,0,Swipe down to end dates? Yeah, that's Cinder.
4,0,0,Dude,there's nothing upon you. (The brick falls) April fool!!!:).
4,0,0,Oh, and let me get the check on this lunch--I cannot remember the last time I did...
1,2,1,My eyes are down here.
4,0,0,I insult you and the the best you can do is "blockhead?"
4,0,0,I'd be surprised if some concrete evidence just fell in our laps.
2,0,1,Sure, the market's in turmoil, but it's not like the sky is falling.
3,1,0,Goose!
1,2,0,This day couldn't get any worse.
4,0,0,My shrink calls it "cinderblockophobia" -- it's an irrational fear of building materials.
4,0,0,I could wait forever for a great idea to hit me.
4,0,0,I hate it when you talk with your mouth full.
3,0,1,Uh, did you order lunch to go?
2,2,1,I could swear I saw my first wife, in a hard hat, go upstairs.
4,0,0,Ummm Bob...
4,0,0,I'm just like Trump. I've been incredibly and fantastically successful in the building and construction business.
3,0,0,Yes, I, too, think that Donald Trump is very honest.
3,1,0,No, I'm pretty sure it's the brick of Damocles.
3,0,1,State Farm, why?
4,1,0,Bob, I gotta say, the decor here is stunning.
3,1,0,Sometimes I feel like a character in a roadrunner cartoon.
3,0,1,"She's seeing a guy named...
4,0,0,Then after the longest time, all of a sudden it hit me...
3,2,0,Sorry. I'm having another mental block.
4,0,0,I hate all these Chicken Little predictions!
4,0,0,I'm going to cut my own dick off and hide in the ladies room. Then when they come in, I'll... no wait, that won't work.
4,0,0,Thanks but you can get the next one.
3,1,0,And then she said: "You can keep your money darling, I am starting my own construction business anyway." I wonder what she's up to, she hates dust.
4,0,0,This writer's block I've been having is really killing me.
4,0,0,We sold the air rights, so now we're building a ten-story condo up there.
4,1,0,I told you we should wait until the glue dries.
4,0,0,As you doctor I'm obligated to tell you. You have stage four cancer."
4,0,0,You really should have had the dessert
4,0,0,Ya'know, those burgers can kill you just like that.
4,0,0,I wonder if this is a piece of the corporate ladder?
3,1,0,wishes really do come true
3,1,0,Quit it, George. Puns are for blockheads.
2,1,1,I've got the check, Doug.
4,0,0,I know it's Friday the 13th. So what?
3,0,1,Don't you just hate those new construction regulations?
2,1,1,So you're not laying me off, after all?
4,0,0,Is that your final answer?
4,0,0,Quite frankly, predestination's a bunch'a hooey.
4,1,0,So, how is the remodeling going in your office upstairs?
3,1,0,I hear the company's just about to start making cuts.
5,0,0,hello
3,1,0,I wouldn't complain about the service again
1,3,0,I just came back from my annual check up ..doc says i'll live to be a hundred.
3,0,0,Quick, your password.
4,1,0,I feel a migraine coming
2,1,0,What concussion threat? I'm an owner, not a fullback.
4,0,0,Hey, you can't stop living or be afraid to leave your house....if you do that, they will win. You can get hit by a car crossing the street in this city, so daily life is more dangerous than anything! You know what I'm saying?
4,1,0,Do you think I should have tipped on the tax?
2,1,1,Let me think about that for a minute.
4,1,0,Since switching to decaf the headaches have disappeared.
5,0,0,A chip off the old block, eh?
3,1,0,My contractor seemed less than receptive about my constructive suggestions.
4,0,0,David, watch it, opportunity is falling
4,0,0,I don't like deconstructionism, and I'll tell you why.
3,1,0,I can't put my finger on it, but I just have this sense of impending doom.
2,0,2,I'm having the Special
3,1,0,My insurance company? New England Life, of course!
4,0,0,This lunch feels like I a swallowed a brick.
3,0,1,There's nothing I fear more than a Trump presidency, nothing!
3,1,0,I just wish more things in my life were concrete.
3,0,0,Weight just a minute! I ordered a concrete mixer! If I am not stuffing concrete in my face pronto someones going to pay!
4,0,0,Well you got your wish.
2,2,0,I want to make a bucket list.
4,1,0,I am not sure that you understand the gravity of the situation.
3,1,0,Hey, are you gonna eat that?
3,0,1,It used to be He just used lightning.
4,0,0,So, to make a long story short ...
3,1,0,That's All Folks.
4,1,0,God would have to drop a block of concrete on my head before I would ever vote for a woman.
2,1,0,Hmmm. What would Newton do?
2,3,0,Not falling for your lame April Fool this year buddy!
4,0,0,Is that a hypothetical question?
5,0,0,Can I borrow 20 bucks?
4,0,0,I said, "Screw you Freddy Newton, you don't know what you're talking about".
3,0,1,Gulliver likes to sweeten my coffee
2,0,0,Cinder blocks used to fall from the sky twice, three times a day. Now it's once month--and that's if your lucky.
3,1,1,Lately I've been thinking a lot about mortality.
1,1,0,You really think the deal will be blocked?
5,0,0,...but give me a concrete example of why we can't continue this way
4,0,0,She was offended when I said : Let's have coffee first...
3,2,0,I'm predicting a major crash.
3,1,0,Do you have an aspirin, I feel a splitting headache coming on.
1,2,1,I think my wife is having an affair with a mason...
4,0,0,My horoscope told me to expect a big change in life.
3,1,0,I'm sure an idea will come to me soon.
2,2,0,I finally feel like a great weight's been lifted off my head.
3,1,0,should I drink this coffee or not ?
2,2,0,Well, there's always tomorrow.
3,0,0,Why don't you get the check this time?
4,0,0,I don't care what my wife thinks...
4,0,0,You should have ordered the appetizer
2,2,0,No, you go first.
2,1,0,Nothing surprises me any more, Jim.
4,0,0,You look so pensive!
2,2,0,At least today couldn't get any worse, right?
3,1,0,Why, after all this time, are you still holding it over my head?
3,1,0,My wife always says I'm hard-headed.
5,0,0,What are YOU drinking? A V8?
3,0,0,What do you mean, death is certain to come before taxes?
4,0,0,I finally see what you mean by building dysfunction is killing you.
5,0,0,Maybe, but now is the time to lean back!
4,0,0,Everybody must get stoned.
4,0,0,So, is that your final offer?
3,0,1,I ordered the brick cheese on wheat toast. Why?
4,0,0,But the most hurtful part was being accused of lacking judgment.
2,0,1,You optimists are always looking up!
3,0,1,Tuesday at the Hard Block Cafe
3,1,0,So I told them 'Who needs your silly witness protection program?'
4,0,0,I really need a cemented opinion here.
4,0,0,You are about to experience a mental block.
4,0,0,I sense something here is asunder
5,0,0,His office is nicer than mine.
4,0,0,I knew we shoulda brought our own horses!
5,0,0,...you just never know...life has a way of playing tricks on you...you could be crossing the street and...
4,1,0,Remember when you said it would rain cinder blocks before Trump became the nominee?
4,0,0,Everything around me is falling apart.
4,0,0,You've been blocked.
4,0,0,Speaking of writer's block...
4,0,0,So I thought, what's the worst that could happen.
4,0,0,I will have a new idea soon.
2,1,0,So far, it hasn't been a bad day.
4,0,0,Harry, do you take one lump or two with you coffee?
4,0,0,I'd say something, but this Danish is just too delicious!
3,1,0,Good food. Bad service.
5,0,0,It's time we talked about the anvil in the coffee shop.
4,0,0,If these walls could talk.
3,2,0,I am gonna make a killing in that class action against the masons.
5,0,0,One lump please.
2,2,0,Jim, do you really want to talk about life insurance? Boring!
4,0,0,Do you ever think where you'll be in five years?
3,0,0,I think there's some merit to this positive psychology movement
3,1,0,My wife is still experimentong with new methods of getting my attention.
4,0,0,Oh, whatever?
4,0,0,By my calculations, should be 0.85 seconds
3,1,0,Unlike me, she was always a 'sky is falling' pessimist.
4,0,0,Look me in the eye - if you have something important to say !
5,0,0,Why did the barrista write, "man about to wear concrete block" on mine?
3,0,0,Well, I won't keep you.
4,1,0,I hear this place wasn't supposed to open until tomorrow.
5,0,0,I've had it with my boss...he called me a blockhead again.
4,0,0,What do you mean, "Zeus is so 20th century?"
3,1,0,I keep waiting for a sign that she hasn't given up on us.
3,2,0,Added her to my will yesterday.
4,1,0,I wonder if I'll get the corner office...
2,2,0,Normally, I wouldn't be caught dead eating at one of these diners.
4,0,0,And then, it was like a tone of bricks...
4,0,0,Coffee doesn't quite wake you up in the morning anymore, eh?
3,0,0,On second thought, have all the sugar you want.
5,0,0,It's like this foreboding sense of doom.
3,0,0,Trump seems like a statistical anomaly - something we can safely ignore.
2,3,0,So I asked myself, what could be worse?
4,0,0," . . .and unlimited refills." Submitted by Douglas Monaghan, Floral Park, NY
2,1,0,Don't look up.
4,0,0,All I'm saying is, if you pray hard enough for God to punish the wicked among us, He will send you a sign.
4,0,0,I told you not to criticize Chris Christie.
3,0,0,Sometimes I get a mental block.
2,1,1,What did you order for dessert?
5,0,0,Because those sandwiches are loaded with empty calories--that's why.
4,0,0,I'm feeling lucky today!
5,0,0,You shouldn't try to talk with your mouth full.
2,2,0,Remember when you said yesterday was the worst day ever?
5,0,0,You know Harry, sometimes you just don't get it.
3,1,0,When was the last time you had a sense of foreboding?
1,2,1,The doc said to cut out the fat, sweets, and carbs, take a brisk walk four times a week, start a daily Mindfulness practice, and I will live a long and healthy life.
3,1,0,...and I said, 'George, you're wrong. What do you need; a brick upside the head to see the Truth?'
4,0,0,Any thoughts on the NFL's concussion crisis?
3,0,0,I couldn't even begin to describe to a person like you what it feels like when one of my great ideas hits me.
5,0,0,What "blocking" looked like before the Internet.
4,0,0,Well you can't say you didn't see it coming.
3,1,0,It's kind of like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop---only worse.
3,0,1,I think all this handwringing about infrastructure is overblown.
2,3,0,Of course I have a will, why do you ask?
4,0,0,Look up.
4,0,0,I just wish I could get a few days away from the office.
4,0,0,I've finally gotten comfortable with the concept of irony.
1,2,1,One last thought...
2,1,0,I need a building code violation like I need a brick to the head.
4,0,0,I'm bored with everything today.
4,0,0,So, stay with me on this, there was this light, this tunnel, this oncoming train ...
3,2,0,I think a term life policy should suffice.
4,1,0,"What's the problem"? "Oh, nothing".
4,0,0,And to think all this time I'd been waiting for a shoe...
3,1,0,I feel like the sky is falling
4,0,0,We close the deal or I'm flat broke.
3,0,1,Even our therapist laughed when my wife told her I felt lucky.
2,2,0,I've run the numbers. The high-deductible heath plan makes way more sense.
2,1,0,Don't you think our waiter is a real blockhead?
5,0,0,Then she said "You think you're really wily don't you?"
4,0,0,Darn if I can put my finger on it, but your Mother seems so distant lately.
3,1,0,I'll tell you man. If I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all.
5,0,0,The great thing is the headaches stopped as soon as I switched to decaff.
3,2,0,Since I hit 50, I feel so invisible.
4,0,0,I was thinking of something a little more concrete.
4,0,0,And then I said, 'A mediated divorce? I don't think so.'
4,0,0,We've had some cut backs on the 2nd floor remodel, but I don't think it will be a problem.
4,0,0,I was thinking should we use 6 or 8 inch block, then it hit me. . .
4,0,0,Talking of more bang for your buck...
1,2,0,...and once my firm reworks their labor deal, the contractor's union will never know what hit them.
2,2,0,Don't take this the wrong way, Gerald.
0,2,1,My LDL is a little high.
2,2,0,Baristas are always so judgmental.
4,0,0,Do you think I should up my life insurance?
3,1,0,Ever feel like you just need to get out from under?
4,0,0,And she has totally forgiven me....
3,1,0,Last night my wife called me a blockhead, wtf?
3,1,0,I think you meant to download Tinder, not Cinder.
3,0,0,Did you tip the waitress?
4,0,0,But at least you haven't had a brick drop on your head!
4,0,0,I feel a draft...
3,1,0,I'm thinking cinder block.
1,3,0,Normally, I wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this!
3,1,0,Come on, saying that you have a writer's block is just an excuse to avoid writing.
4,0,0,Let me repeat. No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.
2,0,1,Well, live for the moment, I always say.
2,1,0,You wouldn't believe my horoscope today.
4,1,0,And suddenly it hit me...
3,1,0,So, anyway, I've decided to sue the garage over a scratch I found on my car.
3,0,0,And that's why I am finally feeling kinda lucky.
3,1,0,I can't help feeling that change is in the air.
5,0,0,It was supposed to remind me of our meeting.
4,0,0,Oh great now I have to do the monthly report.
4,1,0,Yes, I take one lump with my tea. Why do you ask?
3,0,0,I swear, work's been so crazy lately, I'm thinking my head's about to explode.
4,0,0,Well, that's new.
3,0,0,I'd been watching my weight and cholesterol and had been working out. But then I thought, 'What the hell. I'll just let things take their natural course.'
4,0,0,Maybe it’s time to retire.
2,0,1,The last thing I need is another headache.
3,0,1,I really feel like things are starting to look up...
2,3,0,My doctor said I have six months to live.
4,0,0,Has an idea ever struck you out of the blue?
5,0,0,Maybe I'm overreacting but I seem to be like that cartoon character in Lil' Abner, you know the one with the black cloud always hanging over him.
4,0,0,He should have left a better tip.
3,0,0,I don't think my staff liked the cuts to their benefits packages!
5,0,0,"Tipping", isn't an exactly science you know!
4,0,0,If I'm lying, may the Lord strike me dead!
3,1,1,How's my day? So far, so good...
4,0,0,Have your caffeine reflexes kicked in?
4,0,0,Yes, it does look like my candidate is leading in the polls...
5,0,0,I wish that I could think of that guy's name. It's like I have a mental block.
3,0,0,Did you order something to go?
3,0,0,How are you enjoying the — DUCK!
4,0,0,OK. The ten million bucks is hidden in . . .
3,1,0,Here it is, Aquarius: "A smashing event will change your life".
3,1,0,I'll believe in 'climate change' when something concrete happens.
2,1,1,We've come up with some preliminary ideas, but nothing concrete, yet.
4,0,0,I've been hit with writer's block and mental blocks before, but not a cinder block. Why?
4,0,0,Here comes the gluten
2,2,0,All I know is, I'm overdue for a random act of kindness.
5,0,0,Seriously, I'm having some kind of block.
5,0,0,Then it hit me like a ton of bricks - this place is falling apart.
3,0,1,You getting the chicken little salad sandwich too?
4,0,0,I don't know; it just seems nothing interesting ever happens to me!
4,0,0,This coffee packs a punch.
4,0,0,Now we have to worry about another thing coming from the sky
4,0,0,I Will Never Get Married Again !
5,0,0,Why did you want to discuss the concept of 'Deus Ex Machina'?
3,1,0,I've been having these headaches.
4,0,0,Do you remember that silly story about Chicken Little?
3,0,1,And my codicil shall read as follows...
4,0,0,Why shouldn't I have ordered a Venti?
3,1,0,. . . so I splurged on the Ferrari, 'cause life's too short.
5,0,0,I hate it when people say, "It hit me like a ton of bricks." It's insensitive to people who actually get hit with a ton of bricks.
3,1,0,If it's not one damn thing, it's another!
2,2,0,If it's not one thing, it's another.
3,1,1,You will never believe where I hid the money.
4,0,0,What are your plans for the weekend?
5,0,0,The air feels heavy for some reason.
4,0,0,I'm a guy that likes to play the odds....
4,1,0,It's the house decaf, but the first sip still gives you that big caffeine hit.
2,1,1,Finally signed the will yesterday.
4,0,0,Where do you keep your executive washroom key?
3,0,0,Here today---gone to.....
2,2,0,No, I'm pretty sure they don't serve duck here.
4,0,0,I'm done with my To Do list finally, but am only running 30 miles a week. You?
1,3,0,No, not writer's block, I think it's something else.
4,0,0,Is it possible to let bygones be bygones?
4,1,0,Show me something concrete and then we'll talk.
4,0,0,So then my boss said I was a chip off the old block!
4,0,0,That low bid renovation project is supposed to start today.
4,0,0,I'm telling you, this deal is going to be a blockbuster!
4,1,0,Son, if you work hard, you get rewarded. Luck has nothing to do with it.
5,0,0,I'll be honest, I have my reservations about today's reservation.
3,1,0,There are drawbacks to having a magnetic personality.
3,0,1,Unfortunately, all you have is circumstantial evidence. If something concrete appears, let me know.
4,0,0,I must stop playing Tetris
4,1,0,and I don't know when I'm just gonna get take a hint...
5,0,0,If I don't get the check soon, I could die.
4,0,0,There's a great future in Acme Corporation. Think about it. Will you think about it?
4,0,0,I hear their coffee packs quite a wallop.
3,0,1,Maybe I shouldn't of yelled at those workers to be quiet.
3,1,0,This is your classic brick and mortar store.
5,0,0,First, the wife left me. Next, the dog died. Then...
3,1,0,My ex has been in a much better mood since she went to see a fortune teller.
4,0,0,Block don't lie.
4,1,0,i don't know about you, but I'm ready to cement this deal.
3,0,1,All I want is concrete evidence that God exists.
4,1,0,Heaviness descends from the heights, don't you think?
4,0,0,Right now I wouldn't say that should be your biggest worry.
4,0,0,To his horror he realised that the cartoonist had clearly never seen an actual anvil...
4,0,0,This divorce thing hasn't hit me yet.
3,1,0,''I've had some bad luck, but I refuse to believe I'm unlucky.''
5,0,0,You want some help with that lid?
4,0,0,Dave, there's something I have been meaning to tell you.
2,2,0,It's right above me isn't it
4,0,0,Relax, this always happens in cartoons!
3,1,0,... but - as they say - all's well that ends well...
3,0,0,My plans are not concrete.
4,1,0,You don't want to know what a day I had ...
5,0,0,"You might want to say grace, quick" !
4,0,0,I'm getting sick and tired of all those global warming 'Chicken Little' forecasts.
5,0,0,I'll pass on lunch. I think I'm coming down with something.
4,0,0,I have a feeling my overhead will drop significantly...
4,0,0,The competition has hired some wily hotshot to shake things up. Calls himself Coyote.
5,0,0,The weight of my job is bearing down on me.
4,0,0,Olson called me on it. He said that some of my ideas were like floating a brick.
4,0,0,Trump will win, or God strike me dead
3,1,0,Say it--Don't spray it.
4,1,0,What exactly was that waiver you signed walking in?
4,0,0,Duck? No, I ordered chicken.
3,1,0,I guess I'm not having a bad day after all.
4,0,0,Well, he is kind of a blockhead.
3,0,1,I miss the brick and mortar days.
2,2,0,And then I said "who needs building codes?"
5,0,0,I won the lottery and got promoted today. This might be the luckiest day ever.
3,1,0,Eat here long enough and it'll kill you.
3,0,1,Finally, everything seems to be falling into place.
4,1,0,Nothing ever changes
4,0,0,Now, did you ever complete that will of yours?
5,0,0,Please hurry and sign.
4,0,0,I wish they still served coffee in china cups.
3,1,0,You know, I sometimes wonder where I'll be in 20 years.
4,1,0,That block of angry tweets from the Cloud should be coming in any time now.
3,2,0,So lately I've been having this sense of doom.
1,2,1,My doctor told me to stop worrying.
4,0,0,Live for the moment, I always say
2,0,2,The next one's on you.
4,0,0,Have you ever considered investing in concrete?
4,1,0,I am going to go to my grave with the recipe for grandma's secret sauce.
4,0,0,Hmmm..maybe I won't say anything...I'm not crazy about this deal.
3,2,0,What do you mean, "move"?
3,1,0,Usually something hits you like a pile of bricks, but I don't know what a lone cinder block means.
3,0,1,Let me be more concrete.
3,1,0,My favorite cartoon? I've always been partial to Krazy Kat.
4,0,0,I don't know why, but I really loved that caption contest cartoon where the guys were about to get hit by a D train...
4,1,0,Just then, as if by magic...
3,0,0,Anyway -- you'll never guess what happened next.
4,0,0,HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THOSE IDIOTIC INSURANCE ADS ON TV?
4,1,0,Mason, that's the oldest trick to distract me and have a laugh.
3,1,0,Then she said, 'I believe you'. How lucky is that?
4,0,0,Damn! It was your turn to pay.
3,1,0,You should have seen that construction worker's face when I told him to stop oogling my secretary.
4,0,0,Do you have a hat?
3,1,0,The lunch in this place is knockout
4,0,0,...And suddenly it just hit me, like a ton of bricks to the head...
5,0,0,You didn't order a side of falling cinderblock, did you?
3,1,0,Do you think the April Fools pranks are getting out of hand this year?
3,0,0,So then she tells me she's leaving me. What else could go wrong this week?
4,0,0,my feminist blogger girlfriend got it for me..it reminds rich, white men to consider their privilege... kind of flipping the narrative that the fundamental building blocks of society are on our side...
4,0,0,It's not like I sit around waiting for the other shoe to drop........
4,0,0,Oh, so you think I'm the blockhead? Well....
3,1,0,Man. I feel a headache coming on.
4,1,0,Just hit me with it, John. I promise it won't be over my head.
3,1,0,Should have tipped.
4,0,0,I have faith in the above.
3,0,1,Do you think I worry too much?
4,0,0,To go would've been a good choice
5,0,0,My work has just been weighing so heavily on me lately.
2,2,0,Do you ever feel like...I dunno...something big's about to go down?
5,0,0,How the world sees Trump's arrival to the US presidential race.
3,1,0,The gods must have noticed your light headed.
3,1,0,I finally met Tabitha's parents. Her mom's a teacher and her dad's a mason.
4,0,0,You look as though you've seen a ghost--what's on your mind?
4,0,0,So Frank, how hard did you say your sticks fell today?
2,2,0,There’s no harm in being 5 minutes late.
3,0,1,I don't think they liked your Yelp review.
3,0,0,They need to change their menu.
5,0,0,So...you say your divorce is going well?
3,0,0,Just after I got him fired, I told that idiot building inspector, "Yeah, Karma's a bitch."
4,0,0,Bob, did you say you redid your will last week?"
2,2,0,You shouldn't speak with your mouth full ... what is 'looogowwtmmooov'?
4,0,0,I tell you, Frank, it hit me like a ton of bricks.
3,1,0,Ok, ok! In the unlikely event that I die before you, you can have my vinyl collection.
3,1,0,I'll get through this, if the roof doesn't cave in.
4,0,0,I feel like a nap is coming..
5,0,0,I think we should have made that coffee to go
4,1,0,Hey! They finally got my order right!
4,0,0,The food here hits you like a ton of bricks.
5,0,0,Forget the lid on your cup....I think you need one on your head.
5,0,0,And yes, this business plan is absolutely concrete.
5,0,0,Last night I hooked up with this chick named Little. You wouldn't believe the things she said....
3,1,0,Now let's cement this deal and not let anything block it.
5,0,0,My policy has a double indemnity clause for death by cinder block, why do you ask?
3,1,0,So I laugh and say to him, what to are going to do , fire me?
3,1,0,Did you just call me a brick?
1,2,0,It looks like they took your complaint seriously.
4,0,1,Have you made a concrete decision yet?
5,0,0,For the last time, I'm telling you to stop worrying about it.
5,0,0,Thanks for the pep talk, Sam. Nothing's going to stop me now.
4,0,0,Don't believe in bad luck.
4,0,0,The likelihood of Trump being the Republican nominee is as likely as a cinder block falling from the ...!!
3,1,0,"So you are saying that your forecast on overhead issues is becoming increasingly urgent".
2,1,0,This one's my treat.
2,2,0,My philosophy has always been to expect the unexpected
4,0,0,Grande mocha lattes no longer hit me like a ton of bricks. "Grande mocha lattes no longer hit me like a ton of bricks.
4,0,1,Life is about hard work, Jim. Not luck.
5,0,0,Yes, you could say I'm hardheaded. Why?
3,1,0,I hear the 'chicken under a brick' is to die for!
3,1,0,I feel like things can only get better from here.
1,1,1,Seriously, can you think of anything less likely than Donald Trump becoming President?
5,0,0,I don't know what it is today....it feels like I've been hit by a ton of bricks.
3,1,1,But next round on me
3,1,0,There's a subtle difference between a "schlemiel" and a "schlimazel."
1,3,0,I'm gonna be crushed if I don't get that promotion.
3,1,0,What could possibly happen? My prenup incorporates every fail-safe mechanism that one can imagine. She may as well call it a day and move on.
4,0,0,You know that stuff's gonna kill ya.
5,0,0,They only take block payments.
4,1,0,I guess I should have been nicer to that server, but at least she gave me a good seat,
3,1,0,We finally got around to filing our suit against Acme.
3,1,0,Rosebud.
5,0,0,Last night's Fortune Cookie said "To keep covered - even indoors!"
4,0,0,Have you ever been struck by virtual reality?
3,1,0,I've been thinking that I just might be an atheist.
4,0,0,Your cup is half full son. Don't let anything bring you down.
3,1,0,I'll need time to consider your insurance plan.
5,0,0,He did make me pay for his coffee...
4,1,0,Those global warming idiots are like chicken little!
5,0,0,Eating anything this early would hit me like a ton of bricks.
5,0,0,I know it's hard to judge the market, but why do you always expect a crash?
2,2,0,They're serious about that "no elbows on the table" rule.
3,1,0,You know you're setting in my regular seat.
4,1,0,I don't think it's the other shoe you have to worry about.
5,0,0,I'm pretty smart. I don't need a brick to hit me over the head.
4,1,0,There's an old saying about some guy being a chip off the old block....
4,0,0,Clark, you have to realize your limitations...
4,0,0,Hold on to your coffee!
4,0,0,Ever since we broke up, I feel as though a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders
2,2,0,You hear about Bill? Poor guy. Never knew what hit him.
3,1,0,So I think I'm going to cash in my chips and spend the rest of my life working for an NGO, or maybe do organic gardening, you know, something meaningful.
2,2,0,My day just can't get any worse.
4,0,0,If you mess with the timeline, the world fixes itself.
2,0,1,...and not only is he my true idol, I think Trump is downright sexy.
2,2,0,Yes, I'm still writing that exposé on the Masons. Why do you ask?
5,0,0,Where did that come from I think you should go.
3,0,1,They did a nice renovation on this place.
2,1,1,Yeah, but moving is such a headache.
2,2,0,I suppose I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
3,0,1,I can't think of anything, I just need something to hit me.
3,1,0,I'll get the tab.
3,2,0,The hazelnut's extra but hey, life is short.
3,1,0,I'd like to drop another ten pounds.
3,1,0,For once, I really feel like today is my day.
5,0,0,That's Interesting.
2,2,0,We need a more concrete plan.
3,1,0,Insurance is for suckers.
4,1,0,This one's on you!!
2,0,1,I finally got a good nights sleep. " I feel great".
3,0,0,Safe as houses, I tell you.
3,1,0,I guess I'm a chip off the old block.
4,0,0,My insurance company? New England Life of course. Why?
3,1,0,I mean, what else could possibly go wrong?
4,0,0,We decided to cut back on the umbrella policy too.
3,1,0,No, I am not worried about the crumbling infrastructure.
4,0,0,And then it hit me... I come from a different era.
4,0,0,I haven't seen that look on your face since we watched Dad die.
2,1,0,Looks like we're gonna have company
2,1,0,I'll probably die before this coffee cools off!
2,0,0,I don't buy the notion that we're only on earth as long as it pleases the man upstairs.
4,0,0,It's the section of a ceiling beam. Why?
3,0,1,You're not listening to me!
3,0,1,You no longer need to worry about the market crashing.
4,0,0,While at lunch, the idea hit Fred like a ton of bricks.
3,0,1,now here's something that's going to hit you like a brick
4,1,0,It's the unknown unknowns that I worry about.
3,1,0,So I told him again that I had enough insurance and insisted that he leave.
3,1,0,So when do I get my 15 minutes of fame?
4,0,0,When *does* the shoe drop, exactly?
4,0,0,You're right, things are really starting to look up.
3,1,0,My wife said that if she dropped a stone it would solve all our marriage problems
5,0,0,Sometimes you just can't find an anvil on short notice.
3,0,1,Actually, I'm one of the luckiest guys I know.
4,0,0,Maybe I shouldn't have written that Trump is a blockhead
4,0,0,Damocles? Damocles? Wasn't he with Lehman Brothers?
4,0,0,Writer's block is no joke!
3,1,0,I'm a lawyer for union busters--why do you ask?
4,0,0,I've found it best to live in the moment.
4,1,0,And they never rush you here...
3,1,0,You wanna bet the judge will postpone the trial?
5,0,0,Jeff, wait - there is a fly in my latte.
4,0,0,You know what, I will put in a good word for you!!
2,1,0,Nothing surprises me in New York anymore.
3,0,1,I'm gonna need something concrete.
4,0,0,The crash of '16 might soon get personal.
5,0,0,Sure Karma’s real, but shoddy work can trump anything.
4,0,0,Donald Trump and his manager talking about the plans for the US-Mexico wall.
3,1,0,I'm waiting for a sign from above that this is a bad idea.
2,2,0,I'm blocking on the name, but it'll come to me.
4,0,0,Sorry to interrupt you Benjamin, but...
3,2,0,Tell me it doesn't say "writer's" on it.
4,0,0,I was so glad to get rid of writer's block.
3,0,2,I heard this place is known for its flat white.
4,0,0,No one has to hit me with a brick before I get the message
4,0,0,''Is this a sign from my wife to finish the patio.''
3,1,0,Some day the block grant proposal will come back to bite us.
5,0,0,And the worst part about the curse is, they wouldn't let me though airport security.
3,1,0,This writer's block is going to kill me.
4,0,0,Writer's block may be the least of your worries.
3,0,0,I feel like I'm getting a headache.
5,0,0,Which is heavier...a pound of bricks or a pound of feathers?
1,2,1,How many lumps did you ask for?
4,0,0,I told building management "why should I pay five grand for an office space when there is a cafe directly below it!"
4,0,0,"It is what it is" just isn't doing it for me anymore.
4,0,0,Now here's a concrete idea.
2,2,0,Well, at least I've still got my health.
3,1,0,I've finally earned enough points for a free refill.
1,2,1,I'm really feeling groggy today, I hope this coffee gives me a jolt.
3,1,0,I know it's stupid, but I constantly feel like something terrible is about to happen to me...
4,0,0,No, it's not quite like the Sword of Damocles.
3,0,0,I could really do with a caffeine hit right about now
5,0,0,Hope you've got insurance.
3,2,0,I'm telling you, industrial chic is the next big thing in restaurant design.
3,0,1,There's just no future in brick and mortar stores!
5,0,0,...and, if this isn't the best deal you ever made, may I be clobbered with a concrete masonry unit.
3,1,0,Something big is coming for me, I can almost feel it.
3,0,1,Does Obamacare cover catastrophic injury?
3,1,0,It's got too many calories, but I figure, you can get killed just crossing the street.
4,0,0,Whoa! This will surely ring your bell.
5,0,0,Aha! Going over the pitch one final time *can* hurt you.
2,3,0,Good news, my cholesterol is...
5,0,0,I'm voting Trump unless I get some kind of concrete evidence not to.
4,0,0,Then I said to myself. What could be worse than a President Trump?
3,1,0,There's no way he can get Mexico to pay for it...and building supplies don't just magically fall from the sky.
4,0,0,I've never been a fan of the abstract.
3,1,0,Just bought a lucky charms factory. How about you?
4,0,0,I can't really recommend the sandwiches here; they're like concrete.
3,1,0,This coffee tastes like mortar
3,1,0,I probably have been a little too Chicken Little lately.
1,3,0,I ordered the chef's surprise whatever that is.
3,1,0,So - We have a verbal contract -Right ?
4,0,0,Do feel a Graviational Wave?
2,2,0,And so I told her that I'd never had one of those "change your life moments."
4,0,0,Well, Bob, looks like I won't have to let you go after all.
1,2,1,Nope. Definitely don't want to switch seats.
1,3,0,I can't see how this day could possibly get any worse.
2,2,0,I never leave more than ten percent.
3,1,0,Me? I'm long on "infrastructure".
4,0,0,I'm told their menu is very innovative.
5,0,0,Move your latte to your right, quick!
4,0,0,your story is good, but you should've sworn by God
4,0,0,I feel certain now you should have thrown that salt over your left shoulder.
4,0,0,How come now you are telling me you have been sleeping with my wife?
3,0,1,I really liked the last episode of 'The Sopranos'.
4,0,0,What do we need to hammer out this new deal.
3,1,0,No, not a dark cloud, exactly...
4,1,0,You ever wake up and feel like it's not going to be your day today?
4,0,0,Why are you so happy I'm a Solepsist?
4,1,0,Have you ever thought about mortality?
3,1,0,Have you given much thought to life insurance?
4,0,0,Isn't this the building under investigation by the Building Department for shoddy construction?
4,0,0,Don't interrupt me Jerry -- I was about to get to the good part.
3,0,0,Should I warn him, or let his revelation happen?
3,1,0,I said Tinder not Cinder.
4,0,0,"It's a personal decision and I respect yours Charlie, but I'm telling you straight - he's the BEST at jobs, serious about immigration and even has a plan for stopping Drone attacks. What more can you ask for?
3,0,0,Shift right!
3,0,0,Don't be afraid to help a brother out.
5,0,0,I've been trying to block something out, but I can't remember what it is...
5,0,0,So at this point defeating Trump is my only real concern.
4,0,0,When will the renovations be done?
3,1,0,Show me someone who can expect the unexpected, and I'll show you a successful actuary.
3,1,0,My wife says I can't complain to any more restaurant managers.
4,0,0,The idea hit me like a ton of bricks!
4,0,0,On this issue do you think that I should lean more to the right or left?
3,0,1,It's not written in concrete.
5,0,0,The next wave of reality television took its influences from Loony Toons
4,0,0,Quickly, just sign here.
3,1,1,Why yes, this table was reserved under "Wile E. Coyote". Why do you ask?
3,0,0,I just feel something's not right.
3,1,0,So... What are you doing tonight?
4,0,0,My best ideas strike me out of the blue.
3,0,1,Don't tell me - another cinder block?
3,1,0,It came down from corporate; Bob never knew what hit him
5,0,0,I feel like I'm carrying a heavy load.
2,1,1,I mean it. I really don't see how this day could get any worse.
4,1,0,Also, I'm worried all this coffee will kill me.
0,3,1,I quit eating pastrami. That stuff will kill you.
1,1,1,Yeah, the stars are lined up on this one.
3,1,0,Deadlines are a killer.
3,0,1,Did I mention I got Hamilton tickets for next week?
3,2,0,My password is...
4,0,0,If I tell him," thought Time, "he'll just resent me.
4,0,0,I think you'd be perfect for the same insurance I have; it's good for all types of accidents.
3,1,0,Karma's a bitch...
3,1,0,Can I finish my point please?
4,0,0,I want to talk to you about the money you owe me
4,0,0,...right after lunch
3,0,0,I always feel better when I talk to you.
2,1,1,I wouldn't worry about the sales figures.
4,0,0,Still, if that's worst thing to happen to me this week, I consider myself lucky.
4,0,0,''He wouldn't know a good idea if it hit him in the head"
5,0,0,Sometimes after lunch I like to take a nap and just dream off....
4,0,0,You won't believe what happened to me last night.
4,0,0,Her name is Samathia Stone, and I've fallen for her.
4,0,0,Your worries about Donald Trump are over.
2,2,0,What a week! Scratched the car, couldn't sleep . . .
4,0,0,I don't do destination funerals
5,0,0,Its OK, theres one that looks just like him behind me.
4,0,0,The way I see it, my sins will never catch up with me.
2,2,0,Oh don't be dramatic, Herb, it's not like the sky is falling.
4,0,0,Our umbrella policy protects you from everything!
4,0,0,So I says to him, "Why would a guy my age need a life insurance policy?"
2,2,0,This plan covers Murphy’s Law, right?
3,2,0,Relax. The law of gravity doesn't apply to cartoons.
2,2,0,You know, I really love life.
3,1,0,I was looking for a way to cut down on construction costs and, just like that, it hit me.
4,0,0,How's the Chicken Little?
0,4,0,It'll come to me in a second.
4,0,0,Sorry, Ed, but the only way you'll get that raise is over my dead body."
3,1,0,Do you see what I'm talking about
4,0,0,I keep getting hit with writer's block.
4,0,0,I duhno... I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop
4,0,0,So I told him, I don't care where you cut the cost. Just be creative so we get our incentive, and no one will be the wi...
3,0,0,I guess there's time for dessert.
4,0,0,I've always wondered what it would feel like to be a blockhead.
4,0,0,She looked at my Palm and said this would be the best day of my life.
3,1,0,Boy, I can't shake this headache.
2,2,0,This one's on you, Pete.
2,2,0,So here's my 5 year plan...
3,0,1,The owner says the overhead at this location is killing his business.
4,0,0,Guess I'm more of a Newtonian
4,1,0,I don't think this day can get any worse.
3,2,0,I don't know how this day can get any worse.
2,2,0,It's on me -- I insist.
2,1,1,Is it bigger than a breadbox?
2,2,0,This time it's your check...mate.
5,0,0,The aura around you tells me you're going to have a migraine headache shortly.
4,0,0,You ever get the feeling,that an idea is just about to spring, fully formed, into your mind?
4,0,0,While his sensei often warned him to expect the unexpected, this particular trial struck Owen as being a bit unfair.
3,1,0,And then she said, "Don't worry about it, I forgive you.
4,0,0,Figures - the one weekend I wasn't hungover.
5,0,0,You ever have on of those days? If I was outside, I bet a plane would fall on me.
4,0,0,What makes you think that I didn't get what you were just hinting at?
2,2,0,I haven't told anybody, but I'm making you a partner in the firm...
4,0,0,Rain blocks are falling on your head
5,0,0,I don't think that they accept substitutions on the Early Bird Special.
5,0,0,I just have this feeling like it's over for me.
4,0,0,I just feel like I have too much time on my hands.
4,1,0,If it´s Hillary or Trump I´m cashing in my chips.
2,2,0,Thanks for meeting me, Alex. I wanted to explain why I can't back your construction safety bill.
3,1,0,the espresso shots here give you a real jolt.
3,0,2,...So after two disastrous marriages, my job being terminated and the BMW being totaled, I think I'm finally out of the woods...
5,0,0,You really need to get out of your writer's block!
4,1,0,I may not be as hard-headed as I appear!
4,0,0,This is a great place to meet. They're always so on top of things.
2,1,1,I think my wife is cheating on me.
4,0,0,She says I don't understand 'dramatic irony.'
4,0,0,Sure, I tip in restaurants. But at a counter? Nah.
3,1,0,Brick & mortar just isn't relevant anymore.
4,0,0,Heads up, Ed--cement block.
4,0,0,I guess this is the au courant way to be stoned to death.
3,0,1,People complain about bad luck, but it's really about their bad choices.
4,1,0,Nothing heavy for me today I think.
4,0,0,You know how a light bulb appears when you have a good idea? Well...
4,0,0,It didn't feel exactly like a ton of bricks but something else.
2,2,0,My doctor told me I'd live to be 100.
5,0,0,Why wouldn't I need to worry about my vacation plans?
4,0,0,I knew you shouldn't have said that.
3,1,0,New England Life, why do you ask?
4,0,0,President Tump said this would happen if Bob didn't pay his Wall Tax.
4,0,0,''Glad you are still hardheaded.''
3,0,1,Those doughnuts will kill you.
2,2,0,May a cement block fall on my head if the Republicans are stupid enough to nominate either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz for President.
5,0,0,I can feel it, something big is coming.
3,1,0,When you least expect it, an idea will hit you like a brick.
4,0,0,Did they tell you I'm finite?
5,0,0,I can't remember if it was Pope John Paul I, or Pope John Paul II...
3,1,0,I'm more of an anti-mason myself.
4,0,0,Sorry Bill but I have to run...I have a 10:30 appointment downtown.
3,0,1,...I mean, I'd rather DIE than vote for Trump
5,0,0,They told me the neighborhood was going down, but I didn't believe them...
3,1,0,I'm the luckiest man in the world...
3,1,0,I'd like some concrete answers as soon as possible.
4,0,0,Why do you ask which pocket I keep my wallet?
4,0,0,I've heard 'raining cats and dogs' but never cinderblocks..
4,0,0,Yeah, swear to God, why?
3,1,0,No, I don't think Jane knows about the divorce yet.
4,0,0,Mental blocks are the worst.
4,1,0,..and then Schrödinger said that the cat is both alive and dead at the SAME time. How is that even possible?!?
4,0,0,Maybe I should be the new CEO?
2,2,0,The coffee here comes with a kick.
4,0,0,I don't know if I'm ready for the suicide cafe.
5,0,0,I'll tell you the odds of Trump getting the nomination...
5,0,0,I gotta get out of construction, it's killing me.
3,0,0,I just don't see any benefits from working in construction.
4,0,0,I cannot begin to describe my irritation at being called a block-head.
2,0,2,Well, I'm voting for Trump.
4,0,0,I'm very optimistic about the economy.
5,0,0,Call me crazy, but I can't shake this sense of impending doom.
3,0,1,Did you say Trump is dropping by?
3,1,0,I'm just not feeling good about today.
5,0,0,If I only could block out those feelings.
4,0,0,My pollster says I'm widely loved.
3,1,1,I don't tip
4,0,0,Your "Double Cheeseburger Squared" has arrived.
2,2,0,I just wish I could block it out of my mind.
4,0,0,So... how is your day, so far?
2,1,1,I don't think you fully grasp the gravity of the situation.
3,1,0,We should have eaten at the next block.
3,1,0,Newton's Law? Just another example of science run amok.
2,0,2,"Impactful?" What does that even mean?
3,1,1,If God exists, I need some concrete evidence.
2,1,1,Life is...
4,0,0,As your broker, I suggest you modify your position.
3,0,0,Did you order the flat iron steak?
5,0,0,Coffee. What a life-saver!
2,2,0,Do you think the waiter was giving me attitude when I asked to substitute the ethically-sourced kale?
2,2,0,I wish the universe would send me a sign.
5,0,0,What she said was scary, but then it was my first experience with a fortune teller.
2,1,1,Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I feel like that dark cloud over my head has finally left.
4,0,0,to be or not to be is no longer the question.
2,2,0,You have more of a chance of being killed by a falling block than by a terrorist.
4,0,0,I'm thinking of leaving the firm.
3,1,0,Actually, more of a hoper really than a believer. Why?
5,0,0,So I told Suzanne, "Yeah, I really need that - like a need a big concrete block to land on my head!"
3,1,0,Could you get the bill? I'm close to being broke.
3,2,0,And, then again, I might get hit by a bus tomorrow.
4,0,0,I wouldn't actually call it a sword of Damocles
3,1,0,Why don't you ever look at me when we talk?
4,1,0,What do you think God will say when he hears I'm voting for Trump?
5,0,0,I've never fully understood gravity!
4,1,0,Did you ever wake up with the feeling something big was gonna happen?
4,0,0,If you ask me, it's more likely that this roof will fall on my head than America electing an openly xenophobic and misogynist president.
2,2,0,Karma? Yes, I believe in karma.
2,1,2,My doctor says caffeine will kill me. I think he's wrong.
4,0,0,Bill, you look distracted, is it because our profits are dropping like a rock?
4,0,0,Yes, there are many dangers to being a spy.
4,0,0,I can't see anything through these damn Oakley's!
4,0,1,Man, I gotta change the vibration setting on this phone!
3,1,0,Gravity is not a fact, it's a theory.
4,0,0,I prefer sugar cubes in my coffee.
3,1,0,I'm so weary of the ethereal, nuanced ways of thinking.
4,0,0,Sometimes, I just think I'm a real blockhead.
4,0,0,Lately I've had this feeling of being blocked.
4,1,0,I just need a sign
3,0,1,But you would tell me, right?
3,0,0,I'm representing the plaintiff in the crane collapse case.
3,1,0,I just wish I had proof of the gravity of the situation.
4,1,0,Did you know this place is closing?
4,0,0,Let me see now, is it an anvil, or a book, or a toaster? I dunno, maybe I should just say 'Look out!'
4,1,0,So I finally broke up with Bellatrix last night.
3,0,1,You know that stuff will kill ya.
4,0,0,I wonder how long that has been here!
3,0,1,So nothing from her lawyer?
5,0,0,According to Galileo's hypothesis on the speed of falling objects, you have about one second left to live.
0,3,1,And that's when it hit me!
2,2,0,My luck's gonna change. I can almost feel it.
3,1,0,Its not like all these sugars are gonna kill me.
4,0,0,Your future looks concrete
3,0,0,Go for a loftier goal. Quickly.
3,1,0,No, things are not looking up.
4,1,0,I'm a cartoonist. What do you do?
4,0,0,I wrote a poem about the lightness of being, do you want to hear it?
3,0,1,I'm looking for something more concrete.
3,1,0,No pressure.....but what was that stock tip?
3,1,1,I forgot my wallet, would you mind..?
4,0,0,Speaking concretely . . .
