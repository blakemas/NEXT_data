Unfunny,Somewhat funny,Funny,Caption
7,0,0,Rick, remember when you laughed at my shovel purchase in July?
9,1,1,See, it's how you use it that really counts
7,0,0,I see that someone has already wiped the smirk off your face.
9,3,1,When you're a little older you'll understand daddy's crazy.
7,0,0,From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.
7,1,0,Naw, I need the exercise!
9,1,1,You know, Son, our old Mailman used to have a shovel just like that...
7,0,0,Want to trade shovels
8,2,0,When you're older, you can use amphetamines like Daddy does.
10,1,2,I charge by the hour.
7,0,0,It's just shrinkage.
7,1,0,You shovel, I'll scoop -- it's called division of labor.
7,1,0,How the hell did I get the short end of the stick?
7,0,0,No, I am not complaining.
7,0,0,So you're telling me that size does matter.
7,1,0,Do you think maybe your whining is why Mommy drinks so much?
7,0,0,You have a lot to learn son. Bah! Shoveling the lawn!
7,0,0,It's not about size, but keeping a healthy emotional connection with your shovel.
7,0,0,Call me a "simpleton" again and you'll be wearing my boots as well, young man.
7,1,0,Now do you believe in ergonomics?
7,0,0,Hey Dad - last night I heard Mom say your tool isn't big enough.
7,0,0,And we use this little guy for smaller, non-fatal heart attacks, son.
7,0,0,You'll understand when you have your own kids.
7,0,0,Hmm, should I tell him he's shoveling wrong? Nope, wait until he's done.
7,0,0,I was hoping you would get the caption.
7,1,0,At least you can use yours as a sled.
7,2,0,You know what they say, "It's not the size of a man's shovel. but the size of the 'shovel' in a man"...or something like that.
6,0,0,shut up, I know I should of called heads
8,2,0,Sydney, I have a better idea. Lets go buy a snowblower.
9,8,1,Shoveling is a journey, son, not a destination.
7,0,0,Thanks for your good deed! See ya around sometime!
8,1,0,No ad hominem.
9,3,1,Hey Dad. How can you still deny that Global Warming exists? This is August !!
7,0,0,S.O.S., you bet! Same old--same old snow!
7,0,0,I thought you garden gnomes worked just in the summer.
7,1,0,Oh, good. Finished building your 'Wall Against the Rising Tide of Stephanie' next door?
7,1,0,It's not the size of the tool that matters.
7,0,0,When I told you to shovel your own weight, I didn't mean for you to include the shovel.
7,0,0,Snow again?! Interrupting the gerrymandering process.
7,0,0,It's a myth: size does NOT matter!
9,1,1,Sorry kid, there's no app for this.
7,1,0,Just wait! I'll let you know when it's your turn.
7,0,0,No, I don't cur my lawn with scissors
7,0,0,Learn from my mistakes, son, and never, ever forget your wedding anniversary.
7,0,0,Ergonomics
9,1,0,And, the far too late, it dawned on Mr. Friedman: "Perhaps the market doesn't always efficiently allocate resources."
7,0,0,That would have been helpful twelve hours ago.
7,1,0,Hey, low energy. Pick up the pace.
9,1,1,I want tone, not bulk.
8,0,1,Mine has GPS.
7,0,0,Just sign the union agreement and this can be yours!
7,0,0,Where there's a will, there's a path.
7,0,0,better clean up before I get my coffee
7,1,0,I use my toothbrush for the lighter stuff.
7,0,0,Good Lord, how many cats do you have?
6,0,0,Billionaires...
7,0,0,No thanks Ed, I don’t need to borrow your shovel, I’m getting paid by the hour!
7,0,0,Ah, the ambiguity of the paradox of scale.
7,0,0,Don't worry son. I'll be back to help you after the big convention in Miami.
9,6,1,This is better for my back.
7,0,0,It must be opposites day.
8,3,1,It was uphill both ways when I was your age!
9,1,1,But my one per cent is very important.
7,0,0,You tell your mother that's she not funny.
7,1,0,Back in my day we had to shovel with our tongues.
9,1,1,We moved here from Texas. All I have to work with is sand box toys.
8,2,0,What are you complaining about? I gave you the good shovel.
7,1,0,Put that away, Son. We're getting paid by the hour.
7,0,0,2 + 1 ? 1 + 2
7,0,0,Well you wanted to play in the snow. Why don’t you stay out a couple more hours and clean off the roof.
8,5,0,You'll always be Daddy's little helper, but right now I need you to get your ass in gear.
8,3,0,You'll grow into it, then out of it.
7,0,0,Compensating much, Larry?
7,0,0,Think Big,you'll grow to love it
7,1,0,Take a lesson from me- don't dry your shovel on hot.
7,0,0,Are political ideologies going on here?
7,0,0,I knew this weird combo-deal I got would make sense one day.
7,0,0,What are you looking at? I only have a townhome.
7,1,0,Every little bit helps
7,0,0,Two out of three ain't bad is bull, Jeb!
7,1,0,But the flakes are so small!
7,0,0,Why don't you try with a smaller shovel instead?
7,0,0,The weird part is that I made it 43 years WITHOUT stepping on a crack .
7,1,0,Pick up the pace!
7,1,0,Son, please don't question my mid-life crisis...
9,1,1,Remember, son, your allowance will reflect your contribution.
7,0,0,See honey -- size doesn't matter.
8,0,0,Once again, there's no emoji to encapsulate this moment.
9,1,1,Compensating?
8,3,0,Hard work is the greatest tool.
7,0,0,You kids these days want the easy way out.
9,2,1,I never should have told your mother that size doesn't matter.
7,1,0,Quickly, before the kids come!
9,2,1,Last time I play high-stakes Candy Land with you.
7,1,0,If you think this is so funny go audition for the Coen brothers!
7,1,0,Just like my wife always says, "size matters."
7,0,0,No thanks - It's probably best that I don't get to Flint for a couple months.
7,0,0,son, remember it not how much you shovel but how much you feel that you shoveled.
7,0,0,Yeah, that was a government shovel. Too big. Gets nothing done.
7,0,0,No thanks--I've downsized.
8,2,0,It's the journey.
9,2,1,It's not how small the tool son, it's that you git her done!
7,0,0,The other way!
9,1,1,That's why Santa left YOU the big one son
9,5,1,Quick switch shovels, Moms coming!
7,0,0,Because I'm the boss -- get used to it!
7,2,0,Now you come?
9,1,1,You mocking me, son.
7,1,0,I wanted a more hand-crafted, artisanal look.
7,1,0,It's all in the motion and leverage.
10,3,2,Hang on, I'll get the salt shaker.
7,0,0,Son, as I told you, size doesn't matter.
9,0,1,I got a better idea: Let's wait for a thaw.
8,2,0,Welcome to Dad's world.
7,0,0,Bring me the Tonka skiploader from your toy box.
7,0,0,We can do this the hard way or we can do this the easy way, son.
7,6,1,NOW, you find the shovel?
8,2,0,Well at least you can't accuse me of compensating for something.
7,2,0,C'mon now, like this. Bend, thrust, toss. Bend, thrust, toss.
7,1,0,Thanks son, this shovel app is not quite cutting it.
7,1,0,My brain says yes, my back says no.
7,0,0,You remind me of Jeb!
7,0,0,The doctor suggested smaller portions.
7,0,0,This reminds me of a cartoon in 'Family Circle.'
7,0,0,Up yours!
9,0,1,Hey Ed, I just realized that's my scarf you're wearing!
7,2,0,Thanks, but I'll stick with what I'm using. I'm getting paid by the hour.
7,0,0,Does this make history look like fun?
7,1,0,It's not the size that counts.
7,1,0,Watch me son-it's all in the wrists.
7,0,0,It's not the size of the tool that matters, it's how you use it.
8,4,0,No, thanks. I'm undercompensating.
7,1,0,Someday you'll understand -I work for the city...
8,2,0,Thanks, but I really don't want to go to work today
7,1,0,You said you wanted big-boy toys when you took my iPad. Well, here you go.
7,0,0,NOW you tell me you left it laying on the lawn?
7,1,0,I wonder how long you have been out here.
7,0,0,You'll regret buying that once global warming kicks in.
9,0,1,That's right, son . . . . Now yours is bigger.
10,0,2,And no, you will not be getting a participation trophy.
8,6,0,No, thanks. I promised we'd visit your grandmother when I finished the walkway.
7,0,0,See, I told you size doesn't matter
7,1,0,Stop complaining. The more you grow, the smaller YOUR shovel will appear too.
7,0,0,Have you seen the mint chocolate chip?
8,2,0,I've told you before son, it's about quality, not quantity.
7,0,0,Don't let my technique discourage you.
7,0,0,I don't what's worse--the fact that you're standing on the lawn instead of helping or that we have our forced perspective shovels mixed up.
9,0,1,Another snow job!
7,0,0,It's my fair share.
7,0,0,It's an absolute law of physics --- opposites attract.
7,0,0,Shoveling snow?" "No, burying a groundhog - early end to winter my ass.
9,2,1,You see how I’m lifting with my legs?
7,0,0,Wanna trade, Big Boy?
7,0,0,Don't shovel snow on me, this isn't really a snowball.
10,1,2,My doctor said 'no heavy lifting'
7,1,0,Just once I'd like to see you finish a snowjob!
8,1,0,Time for Daddy's Little Man to step up and pull his weight.
7,0,0,At least it's quieter than your jet turbine leaf blower!
8,2,0,I told you: size isn't everything.
9,4,1,Oh sure, but think of the job creation!
7,0,0,I need a pick-me-up.
7,1,0,Man up and get back to work.
7,0,0,...and I bet it's your bra I'm wearing, too.
7,1,0,Remembering back, Jack realized that his father always found ways to make him feel small and incompetent.
7,0,0,The next storm is yours.
11,3,3,Son, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to let you go.
7,0,0,Thomas, you look tired? Would it be alright if Daddy uses the big shovel for a while?
7,0,0,Years of psychotherapy for not letting people walk all over him was clearly a colossal fail!
7,0,0,People are like pigs” JP's muttered during a rush-hour epiphany, “We look up only when we get knocked flat on our backs.
7,0,0,Son, it's not the size of the shovel that matters, but how you use it.
7,1,0,See son--it's not how big it is, it's how you use it.
7,0,0,I said "No, thank you.", not "Snow? Thank you!"
7,0,0,Honestly, I only picked the little shovel because you wanted it.
9,5,1,It's your Mom's idea.
6,0,0,Your mom may be right about Tiger Parenting.
10,2,2,When I was a boy, we used a shingle on a stick, and lots of elbow grease.
7,1,0,Tell your mother I saw her shadow and will be back in six weeks.
8,4,0,Put that away! I told the boss I'd be in when I was finished shoveling.
13,9,5,Attention to detail is important, son.
8,2,0,You are shoveling snow - not election mud
7,0,0,What do you think you're gonna do with that?
7,0,0,Betty, I think it's time we stop buying our snow shovels from the clearance section.
7,0,0,Hey hey, we're The Monkees... and people say we monkey around!
7,0,0,Sizable effort trumps sizable tools.
7,1,0,Yeah, but I read somewhere, in Florida they have a python infestation.
9,0,0,You mean it's not "work harder, not smarter"?
9,1,1,When you get bigger, you can have this shovel.
7,1,0,If memory serves, you eat peas one at a time.
6,0,0,Who said rightsize?
7,1,0,I think we should trade shovels.
8,2,0,Bend your hips, and knees, and push your chest out. Lift the snow with your leg muscles, and keep your back straight. Like this.
7,0,0,I don't need your help. I have an appointment with my proctologist when I finish.
7,0,0,Watch closely, this is how my father taught me.
7,1,0,I suppose you want a participation trophy.
7,1,0,Size is important but you have to know how to use it too.
9,1,1,I learned it all from reading "Rich Dad, Poor Dad."
8,2,0,You want how much for that shovel?
8,2,0,At least yours doesn't make your butt look big.
7,0,0,What's bigger than mine?
8,3,0,It's called Zen and the Art of Snow Removal, son.
10,4,2,It gets smaller as you get older.
7,0,0,Just because you won the bet, Joey, please don't tell mommy that we could have been finished two hours ago!
7,0,0,I happen to like the snow.
7,1,0,I don't know what this thing in my left hand is either. Ask the cartoonist.
7,1,0,You need to put your back into it, like me.
9,2,1,The minimalist lifestyle allows no exceptions.
7,0,0,"...Then use this micro shovel for more intricate detailing of your shoveled path.. Got it?
9,1,1,I need to work on my negotiating skills.
7,0,0,Looks like you've got it covered when push comes to shovel.
7,0,0,No, as far as I know, there isn't 'an Uber for this'.
7,0,0,Please say, you see what I mean.
7,1,0,I suppose you're going to complain about the wage gap too.
7,0,0,You can't rush perfection.
9,2,1,The story of modern day Sisyphus
7,1,0,Hey - is that my hat?
7,0,0,Size doesn't matter; it's how you use it.
10,7,2,Sure, but does it build character?
7,0,0,No, I won't trade shovels.
7,0,0,Making snow cones, how about you?
7,0,0,Can we keep this quick? I've gotta go to the sandbox in half an hour.
7,2,0,How much for the large shovel?
7,1,0,It's all in the technique.
7,0,0,Is that shovel big enough for you?
7,0,0,Good heavens! It's a 'white out' .
7,0,0,They were still having fun after hours of shuffling!
7,1,0,Sorry Mom, I stepped on a crack!
7,0,0,Switch?
7,1,0,When I get done shoveling, I'll give you something to reflect on.
8,5,0,It's not the size, it's how you use it.
7,0,0,It's how you use the stick not the size of it.
7,0,0,Well, that's my perspective.
7,0,0,Snow, stocks, life, whatever. It's all about leverage.
6,0,0,So ironic.
7,0,0,Sometimes bigger just isn't better!
7,1,0,Perhaps we should trade?
7,0,0,Not only that, but it also comes with 100 anytime minutes and 50 gigs of memory.
8,4,0,Where's the challenge?
7,0,0,You have to follow through. Like this.
7,0,0,The trowel troll strikes again.
6,1,0,Was yours an impulse buy at Costco too?
7,1,0,Stop son, we told Mom we are only doing a little shoveling.
7,1,0,You see, it isn't the size of the tool that matters.
9,2,1,Don't worry -- it'll get easier when you grow up.
7,1,0,This is my "me" time.
7,0,0,It's called cross training.
7,0,0,You know, there's an app for that.
7,0,0,This is about pride, son. Your mother says small tools are ineffectual.
7,0,0,The global warming generation, ha! Can't even handle a little snow storm.
7,1,0,Judge me when you're married.
11,6,3,Make yourself useful and bring me the salt shaker for the sidewalk.
11,7,3,Have you found your brother yet?
7,0,0,Fifteen bucks an hour and I'll tell the rest of the third grade to stand down.
8,3,0,It's all in the power to weight ratio.
7,0,0,You know work is just another four letter word
7,1,0,My boss wants me at work when I’m finished.
7,0,0,Would you please dig a six-foot hole and climb into it, son?
8,2,0,It's the spoon nine out of ten escaped convicts recommend
7,0,0,That's it, Hon. Just one heaping shovel at a time.
7,1,0,No, thanks. I'm working on a 12 step program.
7,0,0,It's all about perspective, son.
8,3,0,It's your mom's idea. It's called The Zen Diet.
7,0,0,Think of it like a game - you're the middle class and the snow is taxes.
7,0,0,Lame or not, Dylan, a curse is a curse.
7,0,0,You're a horse's ass, son.
9,2,1,Go big or go home.
6,0,0,Labor laws!? What child labor laws?
7,0,0,Sorry, it's freaky Friday.
7,1,0,SCAB!
7,1,0,It's not size that matters, Billy, it's scale.
8,3,0,It is all in the knees.
8,2,0,Bend at the hips, not the low back.
7,0,0,A winter dunderland
9,0,1,Remember son, it's not about the size. It's about how you use it.
8,2,0,I think I've made my point how ridiculous our 2-party system has become.
7,1,0,Wanna switch?
7,0,0,Finally, I'm going to be the first in line to get something!
7,1,0,Thanks son. But this spoon is doing a fine job..
7,0,0,Pitchers and catchers report ...
7,0,0,We're trading my allowance for your pay check too, right?
7,0,0,You're not in Wonderland, Alice!
7,0,0,I'll just be over here till spring...don't mind me
8,1,0,I'll be down to the corner by spring time. You can just hold that there.
7,0,0,My doctor told me that using a snow shovel could lead to a heart attack.
7,0,0,Alright, so it's not as easy as it looks.
7,1,0,I told you to bend with your knees.
8,2,0,Listen, when I was your age, I had to clear the walk with a toothpick!
7,0,0,Just lift with your legs son.
9,1,1,This must be what it's like to enter the New Yorker cartoon contest.
9,4,1,Don't laugh. I escaped from prison this way.
7,0,0,They say that, "Little strokes fell mighty oaks," but I think you might be onto something!
7,0,0,Ed's chakra takes over.
7,1,0,That's a buck a shovel full, Sonny--minimum ten.
7,0,0,Babe, nobody thought Paul Bunyan's ax could beat the chain saw either.
8,2,0,That's too big for snow cones
11,0,3,When I was your age, all we had were thumb shovels.
7,1,0,Be right back after I feed the dogs and hook up the sled.
7,0,0,It's not about size.
9,4,1,Now why didn't I think of that?
8,3,0,Is this yours?
7,0,0,Where were you three hours ago?
7,1,0,Being the little spoon isn't as fun as I thought
7,0,0,Does Santa know you are moonlighting?
7,1,0,It's not all about size.
7,0,0,At that moment Harokd had both a deep feeling of pride and foreboding
8,2,0,If the Lord wanted you to have the smaller shovel he would have made me give you the smaller shovel.
7,1,0,When I was your age, we didn't even have SPATULAS!
7,0,0,The small shovel is just a gag to make you smile. Your mother and I are getting a divorce.
7,0,0,Busted Crystal Balls
9,1,1,And you promise we can switch after ten minutes?
7,0,0,Dad, remind me one more time how Socialism works !
7,0,0,It's how you use it, that matters most.
7,0,0,I may have to reconsider my belief in global warming.
7,0,0,You see now how my suggestion of the shovel as a conceptual tool really works .
8,2,0,Before my operation that was my shovel.
6,0,0,Don't stop me when I'm on a roll.
7,0,0,You know what they say about a guy with a small shovel.
7,1,0,Yes, I know. If I use the bigger shovel I'll get to work faster.
7,0,0,In the footsteps of Rembrandt
7,0,0,You'll understand when you're older.
7,0,0,So much for partly cloudy and seasonably cool
7,1,0,It's not how much snow you can push, son, it's how much of the sidewalk you can clear.
7,1,0,One day this will all be yours.
7,0,0,So, son, that is why there are Republicans and Democrats.
7,0,0,No Buddy! We don't need another Big Dig.
7,0,0,When you are CEO...
7,2,0,Hey Jeb, remind you of anything? A little goes a long way and a lot goes no where.
9,1,1,See Nelson, then I'll follow behind you and get the cracks. We'll be a great team!
7,0,0,Well dad, I'm doing as best as I can.
7,0,0,Is this my final boss?
7,0,0,Are you aware that I use to walk 7 miles to school every day?
7,0,0,This isn't what I meant when I said all you need is good work ethic.
7,0,0,There may be some lingering resentment.
7,1,0,Dad, not THAT kind of compensation.
7,0,0,Who said Bigger was better!
7,0,0,Our walk's done, Billy. We'll handle the rest with carve-outs.
7,2,0,Great ! Now you find the snow shovel.
7,1,0,I thought this was taking more time than usual
7,2,0,Does the house look smaller to you?
7,1,0,All I'm saying is it's a matter of perspective.
7,1,0,A New York state of mind.
8,5,0,When you're my age, you'll need one like this too
7,0,0,Quick! Before the wolves come!
7,0,0,The yellow snow is gluten free
8,2,0,Wait till I tell your mother I did this with your shovel.
7,1,0,No. I don't know what happened to your shovel.
7,0,0,Daddy will take it from here, Sparky.
7,1,0,We'll never survive this winter if we fail to keep things in perspective.
9,0,0,Sorry, that big shovel hurts my back.
7,1,0,Apparently you don't know how to use yours.
7,1,0,The moment irrational optimism met rigid pragmatism.
7,0,0,I'm already rushing to spend time with your mother!!
7,0,0,Need some hot chocolate?
10,1,2,It looks smaller when its cold out.
7,1,0,We all feel inadequate, kid.
8,3,0,My shovel started out that big
8,2,0,No thanks, kid. I get paid per shovelful.
7,1,0,Hey Kido when ae you going to learn to use the right tool?
7,1,0,No! Your prices are too high. It makes more sense to do it myself.
7,0,0,Hey Mister, I'm outsourcing snow removal. I can get you started in the gig economy.
7,1,0,Winter is not the season for Freaky Friday.
6,0,0,It's not the size of the shovel, it's how you use it that matters.
7,0,0,I think I saw my opposite gender doppelgänger in there.
8,2,0,It's ergonomic, you say?.
9,1,1,Get ready to come back in; I've almost finished the touch-up work.
7,0,0,Think of it as preparation for the 2036 Winter Olympics.
7,2,0,Showoff!
7,1,0,I guess size really does matter.
7,0,0,It isn't the size of the shovel that counts...it's the technique.
7,1,0,You see, Marty? It ain't the size of the shovel that counts! The big-dicked man will always shovel faster.
7,3,0,You keep it, son. I'm in no hurry to reach the office.
7,0,0,Supply and demand be damned! I'm not paying $100 for smsnow shovel."
7,0,0,'I'll shovel off to the mailbox, I need you to shovel off to Buffalo.'
7,0,0,I'll shovel the Trump fans' driveways. You can flip their yard signs.
9,2,1,It's like Social Security. You'll understand when you're older, and even more resentful.
8,2,0,I think it's time to call a spade a spade.
7,0,0,it's all in the legs!
7,0,0,A spade's a spade son
7,1,0,You see son, this is socialism. This is why Sweden is covered in snow.
7,0,0,Who drew this picture? It makes no sense.
7,0,0,Heh. Looks like somebody's compensating. Not me. Look how small my shovel is. You know what means, don't you, kid? You got a small dick. I got a big one. Ask your mother if you don't believe me.
7,0,0,It's a smart shovel. It knows flake by flake what to do.
8,1,0,When I'm finished we'll build a snowmidget.
6,0,0,You see It's not a he size of the tool, it's the enthusiasm behind its use!
6,1,0,Son, please leave that alone. That's for daddy to use when it really snows.
7,1,0,See? This is exactly what's wrong with your generation.
9,1,1,It's not about substance, it's about style.
8,3,0,I'm an archaeologist, not a brute.
7,0,0,Plooity Doop. PLOOITY DOOP.
7,0,0,The economy size gets better mileage.
7,0,0,I told you size has got nothing to do with it.
7,0,0,Where've you been? You could have talked me out of this days ago.
8,3,0,Snow and steady wins the race, son.
7,0,0,Explain to me your upgrade program again?
7,0,0,Thanks anyway kid but this is heart attack snow.
7,1,0,No, thanks... With this one I only have to worry about suffering a wrist attack.
7,0,0,You're receiving a warning from the Association Ralph for the imperfectly shoveled walkway.
9,1,1,I was saving that for special occasions.
7,0,0,F-f-f-focused micromanaging.
7,0,0,Just move to Southern California and size doesn't matter.
7,1,0,Studies say this prevents heart attacks.
8,3,0,Okay, I'll triple your allowance if you trade shovels with me.
7,0,0,Yours is an ice shovel too; look what friction does.
7,0,0,Is it big enough now Edith?
7,0,0,Your mother says she thinks you might be gay.
7,0,0,Hey Tom, what time does Dumb and Dumber come on?
7,0,0,I'm setting you up for success.
7,0,0,Yes, people walk all over me but it's an improvement. I used to be a pushover. Ouch. And before that I was constantly screwed over.
7,0,0,Isn't it your nap time?
7,0,0,Ok the GPS says we are getting closer to finding the car!
7,0,0,What do you mean, mother said the size DOES matter???
7,0,0,I'm sorry, I can't read that when it's upside down
9,2,1,At least you get to stay home!
7,0,0,Shovel faster, Timmy, or the ice cream in this come will be all melted!
7,0,0,Honey, like I always tell you, it's not about the size.
7,0,0,You were expecting the same results as running in place?
6,0,0,Dad, stop throwing rocks!
8,3,0,Yes, but I need the exercise.
6,1,0,One scoop or two and with or without chocolate sauce?
8,2,1,I guess size does matter
7,0,0,Just like my wife says, size isn't everything!
7,0,0,Redrum..Redrum...Redrum .
7,0,0,Hurry up, I'm working from home today.
7,0,0,The elder Johnson was always skeptical of new technology.
8,3,0,I'm a southpaw, so your right-handed shovel is useless to me.
8,0,0,You'll understand when you're older. It's not the size of the tool-- it's how you use it.
7,1,0,Keep Working and you'll get the hang of it Louie.
7,0,0,What are you trying to compensate for, Stan?
7,0,0,It's not the size of the tool but how you use it Freddie.
7,0,0,Hear dad use this one, so I can get there before I have to shave!
8,2,0,Little goes a long way.
7,0,0,Quit complaining and keep digging. How do you think I learned to do this?
7,0,0,No, Henry, I am not eating a Popsicle. Let's just get on with our work shall we?
8,2,0,Didn't realize Dad had shrunk that much since last winter.
7,0,0,Jeb listen to your Mother hurry we are heading to South Carolina.
9,3,1,How many times do I have to repeat it: it's not the size that counts, it's how you use it!
7,0,0,Yeah, well your mom says you're the right tool for the job.
8,1,0,What are you waiting for, we don't have all day.
5,1,0,Hey, grab a spoon and help me.
7,1,0,It's not the size of the shovel, son.
8,2,0,Another life lesson, son. It's not the sword, it's the swordsman.
7,1,0,Size really doesn't matter.
8,2,0,- A Bad Case of Shovel Envy
7,0,0,You're as funny as a heart attack.
7,1,0,Why am I doing all the work with 1/50th of the shovel?
8,0,1,Small shovel, big exercise.
7,0,0,You can stop looking, there's no App for this.
7,1,0,It's either this or I talk to your mother.
7,1,0,Little help?
7,1,0,You're right, it's all in the wrist!
10,6,2,I could have used that five hours ago, Billy.
7,1,0,So how do you like Canada so far?
7,1,0,Yes, I'm a congressman. Why do you ask?
7,1,0,Choose life.
7,0,0,"Wait'll next week. It'll all be gone".
7,0,0,YOU said no snowblower this year.
9,0,1,I'm compensating.
7,0,0,Convinced?
7,0,0,This expands my capacity to 10,000.
7,1,0,That's a Big Boy shovel. Big Boy politicians want us to do more with less.
8,2,0,Don't ever let anyone tell you that size matters.
7,1,0,Another task failure by management.
7,0,0,Son, as my father would always say to me in a tone I never understood, ' You genius... keep working hard, not smart. You have a real bright future ahead of you.'
7,0,0,Mom says to tell you size does matter. ["does" underscored or in italics.]
7,0,0,Hypothermia or no, much safer finding Mom with this, son.
7,0,0,...and it's an ice cream scoop. So, do you want to trade?
9,0,1,A little goes a long way when you're all hot and bothered.
7,0,0,This wasn't what I had in mind when I said "a little help!"
7,1,0,I told you, son, I don't want to use that thing. I'm getting paid by the hour.
7,0,0,But mom why does Timmy get the big shovel
7,0,0,Your shovel is too small.
7,1,0,First one to shovel out the car gets to drive.
7,0,0,Oh! That's what practical means. I thought is was some kind of fish fillet.
9,1,1,Well, if it isn't El Nino himself!
8,3,0,Sometimes it's the journey, son.
8,3,0,Ok, so sometimes size does matter.
7,0,0,The poor and the under educated have to do the heavy lifting, that's how America works son.
7,0,0,I take back what I said. Never share.
9,2,1,Now you understand how our tax system works.
7,0,0,Question: What's wrong with this picture? Answer: My neighbor has cleared part of his sidewalk even before the snow melted for a change.
8,2,0,Tell your mother that size isn't everything.
7,0,0,Yes, Bernie, that is a yuuge shovel.
7,0,0,You see, your mother was wrong: small and fast beats large and slow.
7,1,0,I've been told it's more about how you use it.
12,4,4,Because I promised your mother we would talk after I finished the driveway.
7,1,0,Switch? We are being paid hourly!
6,0,0,G. I. Joe doesn't use a snow blower, just a toy shovel.
7,0,0,You can tell your mother I prefer this one.
7,1,0,What's wrong in this picture?
8,2,0,The joy is in the journey.
7,0,0,I suppose that's your mother's idea.
7,0,0,You can have it back when we're done, and no more singing "Hi Ho, Hi Ho"!
7,0,0,Maybe I should have left David Ricardo and Adam Smith out of his home schooling curriculum.
8,2,0,It's a poor workman who blames his tools

7,1,0,It's not a race son.
7,0,0,If anyone trips, call me today for a free legal consultation.
7,0,0,Dang, if he tries to switch shovels with me I'll lose my excuse to be outside to blow gas.
7,0,0,It's cheaper than the sessions with my Mistress.
9,4,1,Someday, Son, this will be yours.
9,4,1,You see? There are no small shovels, only small snow shovelers.
8,2,0,You were the one who couldn't wait for a snow day.
8,4,0,It's not the size that matters, it's what you do with it.
7,0,0,Do you think I'm ready for the big boy shovel yet? Please.
7,0,0,Son, I'm paying myself by the hour, not the job.
7,0,0,Hey kid, it’s not always about the size of the tool.
7,0,0,Sir, would you still need my shovel?
7,0,0,I bet you drive a sports car too!
7,0,0,Stop complaining, Doris. You know I am better at detail work.
7,1,0,Son, you'll be able to speak loudly and carry a small stick when you have your own children.
7,0,0,where's the Johnny Snow Plow you got for Christmas ?
7,0,0,Son, I've told you a thousand times it's not about the wand, it's about the magician.
8,4,0,You're lucky. Back in my day my father didn't help me.
8,0,1,Wanna trade hats?
7,1,0,Tell your mother I'm not pouting about the snowblower.
7,2,0,If she is paying you buy the hour, you need a new shovel
7,0,0,I'm showing your mom that size isn't everything.
7,1,0,Where did you say your segway was?

7,1,0,To each their own workout routine.
7,0,0,Are you from the future?
7,0,0,Well yes, I do feel a bit silly. But it's just part of the new economy. I'm 52 and rushing a fraternity.
7,1,0,Time to Switch. That's 4 hours.
7,1,0,What do you mean by 'snow shovel equality?'
7,0,0,Son. The key to success, is to do more with less.
7,0,0,It's like coloring. I'll make the lines and you fill them in.
7,0,0,See, this is how the GOP has fixed our economy. I'm so big I can dominate the market even though you have a much better product.
7,0,0,Quit trying that antique and use this app I just downloaded.
9,1,1,Okay dad. Can we cut it with the 'Size doesn't matter' analogies?
7,0,0,Thanks a lot, Santa -- there goes my excuse not to go in to work!
7,0,0,All I asked for was a little help clearing the snow . . . a Gnome from Nome and a soup spoon is what I got

7,0,0,I prefer quality snow removal to quanity.
8,3,0,That's it! Put your back in it!
7,1,0,Have you noticed, whenever we shovel Gahan Wilson's walk, something weird happens?
7,1,0,No thanks, I'm working on my triceps.
7,1,0,You'll be done in no time.
7,0,0,It's all perspective, Bobby.
7,2,0,You're gonna hurt your back, bend at the knees.
7,0,0,Your mother didn't say, "size never matters?
9,0,1,Because it's the little details that really make the sidewalk pop!
7,0,0,It's not about the size of your shovel son, more in how you use it.
7,0,0,It ain't all about the size of the boat. It's the motion of the ocean.
7,0,0,Somehow the trade seemed inevitable, albeit a bit late.
7,0,0,Hey you better watch out, I think my old eyes see an avalanche headin' our way.
7,0,0,Now let's talk about your allowance.
8,0,0,...and here I thought Florida was supposed to be an escape from the frozen north, and I'd never need a snow shovel again!!!

7,2,0,It's not the shovel, it's the shoveler!
7,1,0,I'm not prepared for global warming.

7,0,0,$50 or the snow goes back on the sidewalk.
7,0,0,This is as good a time as any to teach you that size doesn't matter.
8,2,0,Remember, son, it's not the size of the shovel that counts, but the size of the man with the shovel.
7,1,0,Dad, is there a moral in this?
7,1,0,Son when I was a boy my father didn't help me with snow removal.
7,0,0,Butt out, kid, I'm on a roll...
7,0,0,You're good.
7,1,0,And on that day, Maurice taught his son a lesson that all the men of the Sorenson family have had to learn before him... it's not about the size, it's how you use it.
8,2,0,Don't fall into this overachiever trap.
7,1,0,Size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it.

6,0,0,Let's trade shovels!
7,0,0,Hi-tech my ass! I'll bet, you can't slide down a chimney with that thing!
7,1,0,You kids and your damn technology!

7,0,0,Who said life is fair, son?
7,0,0,No, I said 'chisel-tip'
7,1,0,I wish your brother were here to use the medium shovel.
7,0,0,Don't even try to nominate a shovel.
8,2,0,Trust me. In time you'll live to make moments like this last.
7,0,0,At the end of the day, son, it's not the size of the shovel but what you do with it.
8,2,0,I prefer small-batch shoveling.
7,1,0,Let this be a lesson to you, son. Never bite off more than you can chew.
7,1,0,It's not the size of the shovel that matters, is's how you use it.
7,1,0,What a tool!!!
7,0,0,So what if it you think it's a matter of too-much-man-and-not-enough-shovel?

7,0,0,It's the newest shovel, global warming edition.
7,0,0,Okay, it's time to give Grandpa the Big Boy shovel.
7,0,0,Why don't you use a small shovel?
7,1,0,And THAT is what is meant by inversely proportional.
10,1,2,So, if the little shovel can move twenty percent of what the big shovel can move, but the big shovel moves no snow at all, then how much of the snow does the little shovel move?

7,0,0,still overcompensating?

7,0,0,Thanks, son. But I prefer this one as a metaphor for my life.
7,0,0,Young people have lots of drive but no ability. Adults have lots of ability but little drive. We work together and we might just finish before your mom comes home.
7,0,0,Yes, I could use a bigger shovel but I want to see if I can get the feel of what it is like to go through life with a micro penis.
8,2,0,Remember son, it's not the size of the shovel in a man's hand, it's the size of the man holding the shovel.
8,2,0,See son? I told you it's not the size that counts.
7,0,0,I told you winter was coming.

9,0,1,Standing around again? We'll never get done at this rate!
7,0,0,You don't have to understand me now son, but someday when you're living with someone, you will.
7,0,0,I wish, son. You’ll understand this demonstration and hate me for it when you get older.
7,1,0,Don't think of it as a big shovel, as much as a big character builder.
7,0,0,Son, may I please borrow your SUV today? My Smartcar is horrible in the snow.
8,2,0,Your shovel will get smaller as you get bigger. Mine did.
8,1,0,You see son, it's not really work, if you love what you do.
7,0,0,Help! Having...tiny...heart attack....
9,6,1,I'm being paid by the hour, not the job.
10,0,2,Shhh. I told your mother I'd watch The View with her as soon as I cleared the entire sidewalk.
7,0,0,Opposites attract.
9,0,1,Thanks, but your mother isn't always right.
7,1,0,Watch me for a minute. See? You've gotta use your LEGS.
7,1,0,You're lucky. Back when I was a boy my father wouldn't help me like this.
7,0,0,Holler if you need me.
7,1,0,And that, son, is the history of Social Security.
9,3,1,Hey, the project is shovel-ready.
7,0,0,With ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility.
7,1,0,Size may not matter to her, but it does to me.
7,0,0,I gave up efficiency for lent.
8,2,0,No, that takes all the fun out of it.
8,2,0,Why when I was your age I had to shovel snow with a popsicle stick!
7,0,0,If I upgrade to the larger one I may get stuck holding it for 4 hours
6,0,0,Home Depot may have implemented affirmative action, but I'm still a better shoveller
8,1,0,Once I'm done here, it's off to the beach for the sun and sand.
7,0,0,Next time we make a bet, it will have nothing to do with foreign affairs.
7,0,0,No, mine is under here somewhere.
7,1,0,Put your back into it.
7,1,0,Another three hours, another foot.
8,2,0,Please Dad, Not another one of your when I was your age stories
7,1,0,It's not the size of the tool, it's how you use it.
9,1,1,Well, you see, this is trickle down shoveling.
7,1,0,Next year, You can use the iShovel.
7,0,0,It's not the size of the equipment son, it's...it's...well that's not really the point.
7,0,0,Using this sand shovel and imagining I'm at the beach DOES make it feel warmer.
8,3,0,I'm paid by the hour.
8,3,0,First thing you've got to learn, son, is to use the right tools.
10,3,2,And you can paint the fence this summer.
7,0,0,You don't think salt will do it?
9,2,1,Thanks son but this allows for a more chiseled look
9,0,1,I have a bigger shovel, but the wife wants to talk about feelings when I'm done.
7,0,0,It's all about perspective.
7,0,0,Dad, use this. Trump comes on in five ten minutes.
7,0,0,Your allowance is shrinking by the minute, Tom.
8,4,0,I have no idea why your mother says I'm always doing things the hard way.
7,0,0,After I conquer this shovel, do I get the big one Master?
7,0,0,Hey, at least I'm prepared for global warming!
9,3,1,And this, my son, is how to make the most if you are paid per hour.
7,0,0,Get used to it son. I'll always expect you to do more than me.
7,1,0,Hurry up, shorty.
7,2,0,So... size does matter?
7,0,0,enough already. I'm walking to Florida.
6,0,0,You did a great job on the walk, but I get to use the big shovel next time.
8,3,0,You can tell your mom it's my heart healthy shovel and I need a few more hours.
7,2,0,See who else wants a snow cone.
7,0,0,Hey, I borrowed your ice cream scooper.
8,4,0,You sound like your mother. It's not about size.
7,0,0,Silly boy. You're shoveling the yard again.
9,1,1,Son, someday when you grow up it will be important to remember that size is not everything.
8,0,1,I really thought he would grow into that shovel.
7,0,0,I told you, it's not what you have, it's how you use it
7,0,0,This makes snow sense!
7,0,0,Good work, keep it up!
9,3,1,Keep looking. I know grandma's out here somewhere.
7,0,0,Like father,like son!
7,0,0,Yes, son, I know 'Child is father to the man.' But if you don't give me back my shovel, I'm telling mommy!
7,0,0,Look Junior, the hours I waste shoveling the walk are my time away. What do you want? I'll give you anything - just don't let your mother know about this efficient snow removal tool!
7,0,0,And, you thought I wasn't a feminist.
9,0,1,Thanks, but I'll be done in a couple more days.
8,2,0,As you grow older, it just gets smaller.
9,2,1,Now can we agree that size doesn't matter?
7,1,0,symbolically,son, these last few inches are always for the man of the house.
9,1,1,Are you going to ask it to Prom or are you going to finally help out here?
7,0,0,Keep digging. You're close to the treasure.
7,0,0,So I've shoveled the walk and you're my witness. I'm off for your mother.
8,2,0,Lift with your knuckles, not your back.
8,2,0,Try to keep up.
7,0,0,Its' called trickle down economics.
7,1,0,I disagree with you - size DOES matter!
7,0,0,Just making a Frosty the Snow Cocktail.
7,0,0,I appreciate your ambition, son. It seems you can take it from here.
11,2,0,Your'e right, I am less likely to die of a heart attack with this shovel, but I'm more likely to die of old age.
7,0,0,Forget character. You're learning a valuable lesson in strategizing expectations.
7,1,0,Oh! So now, all of a sudden size does matter.
15,11,8,And one day your son will keep you from having a heart attack.
7,0,0,If only I had bought two big shovels.
7,1,0,Its too big for the sand box .
7,1,0,Stop shoveling outside of the box!
7,1,0,Whew. Rob, are you sure by door-to-door the campaign manager meant from the front door to the door of the polling booth?
9,6,1,I'm embracing minimalism.
7,0,0,Outsourcing works this way at my company too, son.
7,0,0,See, it's no different than shoveling sand at the beach.
7,2,0,I know Kung Fu Panda 3 starts in ten minutes; I'm shoveling as fast as I can.
7,0,0,Over here, Johnney. Like this.
7,0,0,Son, I told you to get the shovel your size...
7,1,0,It's the latest iShovel.
7,0,0,I should have gone to Costco also.
7,0,0,You're learning a trade, kid.
7,0,0,Remember, not a word about my 'stamina' to your mother.
7,1,0,Because you speaks so softly, that's why.
8,2,0,Do ya wanna trade?
6,1,0,This is what is called a teachable moment.
7,0,0,Hey dad! Mom told me to bring this to you. She thinks you are avoiding her!!!
7,1,0,My dear, it's not the size of the tool, it's its correct application.
7,1,0,And so ends today’s lesson in humiliation.
7,0,0,'Lazy kids will do anything to avoid work."
8,2,0,It's not the siaze of the shovel, son, it's how you use it!
9,3,1,I'll be done by March.
8,3,0,sometimes less is more
7,0,0,Whadya mean "What am I doing here"? I'm the latest conceptual art installation from the Museum of Contemporary Art.
7,0,0,Like I say, size doesn't matter.
8,2,0,Why use that when I've got this app on my phone?
7,0,0,It is quality, not quantity, that is the most personally satisfying.
7,2,0,Since I only get you on the weekends, I need to be creative with the character building exercises.
7,1,0,If size mattered you wouldn't be here.
7,0,0,Do you have to condensate for something over there?
6,0,0,Is he holding the shovel or is the shovel holding him?
8,5,0,See? Manual labor is not at all like Minecraft.
7,1,0,Compensating? No, I'm not 'compensating'. You?
8,3,0,Yes Bobby, that's the one that gave your mother her bad back
8,0,1,Forget the shovel. Go into the house and get your toothbrush to help daddy clean the walk.
7,0,0,Call your mother. This could go viral.
7,1,0,Straight A's = small shovel.
7,0,0,Wanna swap?
7,0,0,You're sure your mother's inside?
7,0,0,I had to win the gambling with a son and get bigger one...
9,3,1,Things seem bigger when you are young. When you are older it will seem small.
7,0,0,Yes, my shovel is 99% bigger, but you're 99% bigger than me. So it works out. Keep shoveling.
6,0,0,Don't judge a man by its cover. A little man can sometimes do more than a big man.
7,0,0,It is all in how you use it.
7,0,0,Oh no, life's nothing but an Etcha-a-S . . .
7,0,0,Go tell Mom she wins, we're moving to Florida.
7,1,0,Put some muscle into it, son. Like this.
7,1,0,Put some elbow into it.
10,1,2,The cold made it shrink.
11,2,3,Remember, lift with your knees, not your back!
6,0,0,That's the last time you tell Mom about Dad's secret beer cooler.
7,1,0,Can you believe your mother calls me a perfectionist?
7,0,0,You're handling it with kid gloves.
7,0,0,Get on the walkway dummy!
7,0,0,Bend at your knees!
7,1,0,Just remember, son: Size doesn't matter.
7,1,0,I have an idea: let's switch coats.
7,1,0,My mom says it's to bad you don't have a bigger one, and then she laughed.
7,0,0,You knew going into this business venture that I was the brains and YOU were the muscle!
6,0,0,I told you our therapist is wrong -- size does matter!
7,0,0,Now you go out and sign up three more kids to shovel; that's how you retire early.
6,0,0,You'll understand when you're old enough to drink coffee.
7,0,0,If this turns to rain, I'll take your umbrella.
7,1,0,And when it all melts, I have a shot glass you can use to clear away the flooding.
7,0,0,I call this the 'Bernie Sanders' strategy.
7,0,0,I'm glad you are helping me son!
8,2,0,I believe in quality, not quantity.
7,0,0,'...Let's swap wives too'
7,1,0,This isn't as funny as I thought it would be.
7,2,0,This is why you got a snow day.
8,0,1,It's a lesson in politics, Jeffery.
7,0,0,He's got his mother's biceps
7,1,0,Make America great again my ass!!
7,1,0,A sled? You don't want one, I've seen Citizen Kane.
7,0,0,It's not the size of the tool, son, it's whether your gonna use the darn thing.
7,0,0,See, it's about the motion of the ocean, son.
7,1,0,The shovel shaming continued for another winter, and Wally wondered if he'd ever emerge from his father's shadow.
6,0,0,You're right, dear. My shovel works a lot better.
7,1,0,Don't overexert yourself, Junior!
7,0,0,Is this the Mr. Softie residence .
7,0,0,It is a Lake House and I am getting close.
9,2,0,Unlike some pathetic losers I know, I prefer to undercompensate.
7,0,0,there's an obvious dick joke here, but i'm not going to tell it because you're eight and i suspect it's not, like, good parenting to give you the impression that i've spent a lot of time considering the sizes of dicks
9,0,0,The Mystery: Why big man are usually "small".
7,1,0,Your father's no wussy!
7,1,0,God loves a lonely hero, son...
6,1,0,Go tell Mom she made her point; size does matter!
9,3,1,Sure, it would be easier. But the detailing would be all wrong.
8,2,0,El nino?
6,0,0,Wanna exchange shovels?
7,1,0,I'm teaching you about the national debt.
8,2,0,Do you have any evidence that I swapped mine for yours?
11,5,3,Only the mediocre workman blames his tools!
7,0,0,Remember, son, it's not the size of your shovel but how you throw the snow!
7,2,0,Life's full of ironies isn't it?
7,0,0,I'm totally taking the fifth.
7,1,0,Where do I get one of those?
7,0,0,Remember kid, it's not the size of the shovel, but how you use it.
7,0,0,It's Effective!
7,0,0,Some women might tell you that size matters, but I know my wife.
7,0,0,A convenient mixup, mom.
7,1,0,You've got to lift with your legs. Watch me do it.
7,0,0,John was ironic; his wife was a surrealist.
8,0,0,I can't feel my face when I'm with you
8,0,0,Mom says she needs that spatula for the flapjacks.
7,0,0,I told you not to stop!
7,1,0,Hey pal, you need to get a new perspective
9,1,1,Thank you son, but spatulas are a family tradition.
7,0,0,I figure that by the time I finish, the snow will have melted.
6,0,0,You ask why? Because I'm the father.
8,3,0,Where were you nine hours ago?
9,0,1,Sure, son, we can go sledding, but let Daddy finish his chores first.
9,2,1,When I was your age we had to shovel our way to school, two miles each way — uphill in the snow!
7,2,0,Never bring a meta shovel to a proto snowfall.
8,6,0,The trick is, the longer you spend in the snow, the more likely you are to win an Oscar.
8,1,0,I asked my teacher today about child labor laws.
7,1,0,Bigger isn't necessarily better, son.
8,2,0,We weren't hired to shovel the lawn.
8,2,0,By an inch is a cinch, by a yard is extra hard.
7,0,0,Sunny Boy! A credit card on a popsicle stick is all you need!
7,1,0,Come on, Tom Sawyer is going to let me do his driveway too.
7,1,0,Now do you believe me that size doesn't matter?
8,2,0,Son, it's a poor workman who blames his tools.
7,0,0,I know your wife told you that size doesn't matter. But...
7,2,0,Even after 25 years I still like to prove to your mother that size doesn't matter.
7,0,0,See? That what you get with socialist redistribution.
9,0,1,Tell your mom to get out here so I can finally prove to her that size doesn't matter.
8,2,0,Next time I get to choose odd or even!
8,2,0,Good job, Dad. It's not the size of the shovel, but how you use it.
7,0,0,Hey kid. Get busy!
8,2,0,C'mon son! success is 1% inspiration 99% perspiration
9,0,1,When you wear big boy pants, you use the baby shovel.
7,0,0,Next we have to do the driveway.
7,0,0,I will trade you for that "scoop" shovel.
7,0,0,Have a nice Spring!
7,0,0,That's what you call a shovel. This is a SHOVEL
7,0,0,Hey Dad... FEEL THE BERN!
9,1,1,I feel like we would make better progress if we switched shovels, don't you think?
7,1,0,Pass the salt!
7,1,0,On average, they're both perfect.
7,0,0,When you could'nt afford an expensive snow shovel, but Santa gave it to you for Christmas...
6,1,0,It's just an optical illusion.
7,1,0,It's the motion that counts.
6,1,0,You see son, A poor workman blames his tools.
7,0,0,Because the snow is heavier up here, that's why.
7,1,0,Tomorrow we'll get into guns vs. butter.
8,2,0,Still think bigger is better?
7,0,0,It's cotton candy, Bro!
8,5,0,It's all in the wrist action.
7,0,0,What did you expect? I'm for Bernie Sanders.
7,0,0,I triple dog dare you!
7,0,0,I am getting paid by the hour. How about you??
8,3,0,hurry up Bobby! Find the Dog! BARK! BarK!
7,0,0,Damn Daniel!!
7,0,0,Just look at your old man go!
7,0,0,And that's how men did it when they were your age.
8,2,0,Careful son, that's not a toy.
10,0,1,Hey Dad, Mom says maybe you could use this instead of a spatula.
7,0,0,Don't speak so softly.
7,1,0,Wrong! Slow and steady does NOT always win the race.
7,1,0,I have less character to build.
7,0,0,Mommy said it was right in the garage where she said it was???
7,1,0,It's quality not quantity, kiddo.
10,6,2,I've been at this for two days and NOW you find the shovel!
7,1,0,If my scoop is ten times smaller, when will we finish Johnny?
8,3,0,It is all about leverage!
7,1,0,Mine is too small. Yours is too big. Come on, let's switch hats.
7,0,0,Mrs. Robinson, weren’t you the one that taught me that it’s not the size of your shovel but it’s how you swivel it?
9,4,1,Nonetheless, the entire walk is clear of snow.
7,0,0,Why didn’t I think of buying a bigger shovel?
8,3,0,No, I can't come dig you out!
7,1,0,I only use that one for political snowjobs.
7,0,0,Daddy, suffering independence or socialist leanings?
7,1,0,Come on, Willie, I used to walk to school barefooted in this stuff.
7,1,0,You knew I was a short order cook when you asked me to help.
7,0,0,Remember Son, it's not the size of your shovel, but how you use it.
6,1,0,Junior, this is what I mean by counter intuitive!
8,2,0,Ok, you've proved your point that it's not size that counts but what you do with it. Can we go back inside now?
8,0,0,So who wants to grow up big and strong like you, Daddy, now?
7,0,0,Thank you. I feel validated.
7,1,0,This is my fetish.
7,0,0,Short man. Tall Shovel
7,0,0,I guess it's true, it's not the size of the shovel, but the size of the shoveler !
7,0,0,What? Lady, my name's Melvin, not Sisyphus.
8,3,0,Final offer I'll triple your allowance for the shovel.
8,2,0,OK, you won the coin flip. When will you start shoveling?
8,2,0,I told you, my son, size doesn't matter
9,0,1,Remember how I love bonsai?
7,0,0,You told me that size doesn't count for everything.
7,0,0,Ok,now do you see the difference between a Daddy shovel and a little boy's shovel?
8,2,0,Now you show up!
7,0,0,It's shovel full, not mindful.
9,1,1,You see, there's an inverse correlation between the size of the shovel and the amount of character built.
7,0,0,Someday you will learn, son, that it helps to adapt when you're not well endowed.
8,2,0,Don't bring a spoon to a shovel fight.
7,0,0,Faster.
7,0,0,Mr. Hitchcock and his gnome enjoyed the changing seasons.
7,0,0,Well, at least I have one important thing bigger than you.
7,1,0,Mom says to use this to shovel the walk unless you want her to flip the burgers with a plunger
7,0,0,You can take this job and shovel it.
7,1,0,It's all in the wrist, son.
6,0,0,Your find in life Son the Devil is in the detail
10,1,2,Of course I knew we had that in the shed.
9,1,1,It's not as mismatched as it looks. Are you familiar with 'parallax error'?
7,1,0,It's the city drones, Charlie! Shovel faster before we get fined!
7,1,0,I told you we should have picked up the milk and eggs yesterday.
7,1,0,One small scoop by me, one giant walkway cleared.
7,0,0,Hey son, this is what I call teamwork!
8,1,0,You're still not getting a bigger allowance.
7,0,0,Sorry I mentioned we switch tools, Napoleon. Carry on!
7,1,0,Your allowance just became non-non-negotiable.
7,0,0," Have fun, Im going to "DISNEYLAND".
7,0,0,I see we have a future politician in the family.
7,1,0,Maybe when you're through shoveling the lawn, you can mow the sidewalk.
9,0,1,You see? It's not the engine, it's the engineer.
7,1,0,Sorry, this is more exercise.
10,1,2,Because when I'm done shoveling the sidewalk I have to rub Grandma's nasty feet, that's why.
7,0,0,This is what we get for shopping on Craigslist.
7,1,0,... and in high heels, too.
8,2,0,You're overcompensating.
7,1,0,I saw it on "Escape from Alcatraz." What's your excuse?
7,1,0,Did he say a 100 foot path 36 " wide or a 36 foot path, one hundred inches wide?
7,0,0,As I told your mother, bigger is not necessarily better.
7,0,0,Shovel Envy
7,4,0,Thanks, but I'm getting paid by the hour, if you get my drift.
7,0,0,Grandpa wants to know if you would like a cup of hot Coco?
5,0,0,I'm almost finished,then we'll play
9,8,1,Do you see how I'm lifting with my legs?
9,5,1,Because I'm the detail man that's why!!!
7,0,0,Your mother used all the driveway salt in the pasta.
7,0,0,Hey, when I was your age, I didn't get any help shoveling.
8,0,1,Don't tell your mother.
9,0,1,Size does not matter if you have LOWBANDWITH.
8,3,0,It's like you WANT me to go back to work.
9,3,1,If you're Yoda, give me The Force; if not, give me your shovel.
7,0,0,Everyone, son, has their own path and their own journey.
7,1,0,Because your father is a trained archeologist.
9,1,1,I'm trying to fulfill my duty as your parent to demonstrate a cliché-laden metaphoric life lesson about the virtues of hard work, perseverance and overcoming obstacles; could you just let me?
7,0,0,Norm realized smaller does mean better!
7,0,0,Son - your mother just told us to shovel the sidewalk. She did not specify how quickly she would like us to complete the task.
7,1,0,Son, when you grow up you will learn that effectiveness is not the same as efficiency.
7,1,0,See, son? It's not the size -- it's how you use it.
6,0,0,All I can tell you is that there's a proverb here somewhere.
8,2,0,Great, now we're an idiom.
7,0,0,c'mon, Ma...cigarette break's over
7,0,0,Son, I know what your teacher said but taking turns isn't always a good thing.
7,1,0,Ha! It's not the size of the shovel, it's the devotion to motion!
8,7,0,Optical Illusion #10 - The shovels are the same size!
7,0,0,It's never too early to learn how to shovel it.
7,0,0,Junior! It's not the size but how you use it.
8,2,0,I'll let you know when I need it.
9,2,1,Don't worry - your little sister is coming soon with the bulldozer.
7,0,0,I'll trade you this spoon and a Happy Meal, for the shovel.
7,1,0,You won't be afraid of clowns anymore after we build a healthy fear of hypothermia.
8,0,0,Thank you, no. I'm been doing fine with my silicone spatula and timely shots of non-stick cooking spray.
7,0,0,It's Silicone. You should get one. Kitchen Gadgets Online.
7,0,0,And this is what would happen if Washington bureaucrats told us how to live our lives son.
9,5,1,Sure, it takes longer, but artisanal small-batch shoveling leaves each sidewalk truly unique.
9,0,0,No you know how I feel when we go to the beach.
7,0,0,Pop, let's trade, I'll take the shovel you take this spatula!
7,0,0,This new Technology is making my hard work obsolete!
7,0,0,And better yet, it runs off just two triple A batteries.
7,0,0,Shovel-off!
7,1,0,Piece of cake, son. Why don't you finish up.
9,3,0,Finish shoveling the grass but don't get any snow on the sidewalk.
7,0,0,Your mom doesn't want me to vote for Bernie.
7,1,0,"No, it doesn't correspond to my shovel size!'
6,1,0,It's an app called 'Snowblower.' Standard data charges may apply.
8,7,0,Oh, so now you don't want the big boy shovel anymore?
9,4,1,It's all about quality, not quantity.
7,0,0,You're a troll...
8,2,0,Yeah, with all the Global Warming talk I thought it was a smart buy.
6,0,0,Shovel it.
7,0,0,Son, remember this lesson if a woman ever tells you that size matters.
7,1,0,I lost a bet, what's your excuse?

7,1,0,Compensating for something?
7,0,0,'We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.'
7,0,0,One day, when you're old enough, this will be a useful metaphor
7,1,0,Archimedes would have loved this.
7,0,0,Get your head out of the gutter, son!
8,3,0,Picasso didn't shop at Sherwin-Williams, Billy.
7,1,0,For the last time, my name's not John Snow, I know winter is coming, and stop staring at me with those blue eyes....
6,1,0,You should be using your legs, not your back.
7,1,0,Your allowance is 10,000 shovelfuls that way.
9,3,1,I feel like we want different things.
7,0,0,I keep hearing your Mom, she needs you inside.
7,0,0,Go tell your mother it's too late for an apology!!
8,2,0,Now you can understand the dangers of big government! Your mother is the one who insisted on buying you that subsidized shovel!
7,1,0,Should have had another son.
7,0,0,I suppose we should have expected this from Winter Storm Goldilocks.
8,4,0,With the big shovel comes big responsibility.
7,1,0,Pretend I'm the CEO.Think of this as a reality check for the American dream.
7,0,0,Yes son, that's the one I meant.
7,0,0,Still life with still frozen
8,2,0,Barbie's shovel? I wondered why it was taking so long.
6,1,0,Come on mom, we have 5 more houses to do.
7,1,0,Who is your father, he is way too harsh.
7,1,0,Quality not quantity; remember that lad.
9,2,2,Left my other shovel at the beach house.
7,0,0,And once the edges are perfect I like to finish up with some 100 grit sandpaper
7,2,0,Get inside with that before your mother sees you.
7,0,0,Hurry up! This one-percenter is doing his part.
7,0,0,Have you seen the little guy with the lantern?
7,0,0,If we switch back again then you'd be no better than Trump, is that what you want?
7,0,0,Fifteen bucks an hour and the third grade stands down.
7,1,0,Shoveling my way to the store. Need anything?
6,1,0,Mom's making bacon and eggs and she wants you to use this one.
7,1,0,Your mother wants me to teach you about fairness.
9,1,1,I like to give the snow a sporting chance.
7,0,0,I always new size didn't matter
7,0,0,See Prudence, like I've told you for years, but you wouldn't believe me...size doesn't matter."
8,2,0,You're not from around here, are you?
7,0,0,Wait! Heads I win tails you loose?
7,1,0,All I know is that I have never hurt my back shovelling snow when I use this shovel.
7,0,0,Yes, but it's quality snow.
8,7,0,Son, I really wish you'd suggested that 7 hours ago.
8,4,0,You see son? Every goal can be broken down into a multitude of smaller goals.
9,0,1,You finally get to be the bigger man and help, but you are just standing there.
7,0,0,What do you mean I'm lacking perspective?
7,1,0,Size isn't the only thing that matters.
7,0,0,Overcompensating, sonny?
6,2,0,It's not the size of your shovel, it's how you use it.
9,5,1,It's the French way. I read an article.
9,0,1,Bigger is better, huh?
8,2,0,Thanks, but my cardiologist warned me against scooping too much snow at a time.
7,0,0,Am I going to the right? No, I'm just turning to smile at the audience. You think I should I use a big shovel?
7,0,0,Let's go inside and have some 1/16th scale hot cocoa.
9,0,1,Son, let this be a life lesson for you: sometimes the other guy gets the 'cushy' job!
7,0,0,My milkshake brought all the boys to the yard.
8,2,0,Don't tell your mother this is why it takes me so long.
7,1,0,Quality, not quantity.
9,3,1,Keep shoveling while I try to unfreeze my light saber.
7,0,0,I make the most in life with what I have, son.
7,0,0,Son, we just have to use the gifts God gave us.
7,1,0,No, really!" "If you have a better way of doing this I'd love to hear it!
7,0,0,I'll have time to listen to your idea AFTER we finish this incessant shoveling.
7,0,0,Size matters... so do the heating coils under the sidewalk.
7,0,0,I'm very good at micromanaging.
7,0,0,Biggest computer, biggest ice cream, biggest toy...but OH NO!
7,0,0,For my audition, I'll be tap dancing as I shovel off to Buffalo.
7,1,0,The key is lifting with your legs.
7,0,0,Thus, you see, son, coffee is God!
8,2,0,The guy at the hardware store said size doesn't matter
7,0,0,Yea well its the journey not the destination ,right
8,2,0,Tooth fairy don't pay for lost.
7,2,0," What ever you do don't let mom know you found it".
10,1,2,Look, if you aren't going to take this seriously, just go inside.
7,0,0,I told you slow and study always wins
7,0,0,Don't gloat, son, that you got to the garage first.
7,0,0,Why is his spade is bigger than mine?
7,1,0,Remember, son, size isn't everything.
7,0,0,There's gonna be some shrinkage if it snows any more than this.
7,0,0,Take my advice. It's not about size; it's about how you use it.
9,1,1,This sucks. We need to join the tiny house movement.
7,1,0,It's all I can afford, living on Bank Interest!
9,0,1,When I was your age, I had to walk 5 miles to school shoveling snow with that shovel.
7,0,0,This is a teaching moment Fred: Size does not matter.
7,0,0,so, how do you pronounce it again? Florida?
8,2,0,You'll never find Mom with that one.
7,0,0,Honey, it's a lot easier if you hold the shovel like this.
7,1,0,It's not the size of the shovel, it's the scraping of the paving.
7,0,0,Consider it a $5.00 upgrade with a Sig.given That Where were you last week when I started this project?
9,2,1,I’ll use it after Mommy’s family leaves.
7,0,0,Overcompensate much?
8,2,0,Dad, Mom said take this shovel. She's sorry but size does matter.
8,2,0,This shovel was the same size as that one three hours ago.
6,0,0,It's not how big your shovel is, it's how you use it.
7,1,0,Take this job and shovel it.
9,2,1,There's no App for this.
6,0,0,Bernie was right.
7,0,0,How many more houses?
7,0,0,But I heard you tell Mom, size doesn't matter!
7,0,0,After the neighbors caught Dale fetching the paper naked, their mocking grew merciless.
7,0,0,Just goes to prove that size doesn't count.
8,2,0,Because I'm a partner and you're an associate.
7,1,0,I don't know about you, but I'm headed to the beach.
7,1,0,Santa's finally starting to dig out!
7,0,0,All I did was put a few big ones on the Cardinals
7,1,0,Bar mitzvah, bar shmitzvah, Neil; today you are a man.

7,0,0,Now who's laughing at my shovel app?
7,1,0,Upstate Ergonomics 101
7,0,0,I don't suppose you'd want to consider a swap...?
7,0,0,Is that what they've been teaching you at that fancy school of yours?
7,1,0,Aren't you the same kid that offered to shovel my walk two weeks ago?
7,0,0,I'm proving a point to your mother.
9,0,1,OK, that's one thousand for me. Now you do yours.
7,1,0,The groundhog lied.
7,0,0,I will shovel your social security check and you shovel mine, son.
8,2,0,Watch me, son. Just one scoop at a time.
7,0,0,Come on, kid, it's not the size of the dog in the fight...
7,0,0,Smartness over brute force!
9,1,1,I guess not everything is too big to fail.
7,2,0,It's not the size of the man, it's his equipment.
7,0,0,Are you sure the Amazon drone got the right addresses?
7,1,0,You know what? Let's move.
7,1,0,One day, you'll have a little one. Just like this.
8,0,0,Hey buddy I think you need some hot chocolate.
8,2,0,That one's fine for a rough-out, but if you really want it perfect you need one of these.
7,0,0,Honey, we make a great team!
8,0,1,How's that book report on Tom Sawyer going?
7,0,0,It's called the quicker picker upper
7,1,0,It's 2016. Aren't robots supposed to do this?
7,1,0,Ah. You must be the boy sent to do a man's job.
7,0,0,I'm from Buffalo.
7,1,0,Size matters.
7,0,0,Nah. I'm trying to make this last until after the election.
9,1,1,I'm boutique shoveling.
8,2,0,For the last time, I don't want to upgrade to Premium Economy.
7,0,0,Like I keep telling you, it's confidence not size that matters!
7,0,0,Yes, I know what your other grandmother thinks!
7,0,0,When I started shoveling this walk there was no snow.
7,0,0,Son, when you're married you will understand.
7,0,0,When you feel tired, use my snowplough.
7,0,0,Best cocaine harvest in a decade. Thanks, El Niño!
7,0,0,I know your mother is always saying size matters, but we'll just show her size isn't everything.
8,2,0,Stay out of my territory.
7,0,0,I could have sworn the keys fell out on the path.
7,1,0,If you think that's big, you should see my...
7,0,0,Good job Timmy. We managed to shovel the walkway and get in a lesson on resource distribution at the same time.
7,0,0,I know you're from Atlanta, but that's ridiculous.
8,1,0,Darn, that's not our house.
7,1,0,I know, baby - you'll dig it the most...
7,0,0,... and that's why the marginal tax rate doesn't make sense either.
7,1,0,Just five minutes and then I get the big boy shovel again.
8,3,0,Here, let me help you with the sidewalk.
7,0,0,Well, son, It's because I have something called a union card and you don't.
7,0,0,It's a Zen thing.
8,2,0,Back in my day.
7,1,0,I told her it wasn't the size of the shovel that mattered!
9,3,1,Shovels don't clear sidewalks, people clear sidewalks.
9,2,1,No, the point is avoiding mommy.
8,0,1,You must have been trained by an undertaker!
6,0,0,Summer 2020
7,2,0,We all die in the end anyway, so what difference does it make?
7,1,0,Don't let anyone lie to you, size is everything.
9,1,1,Finesse! Always finesse.
7,0,0,We're the 'Lenny' and 'George' of 'Snow And Miniscule Tools' eh? Enjoy, my friend.
7,0,0,Trust me, there's no App on there.
7,0,0,Hey...I'm just scraping by!
7,0,0,this is a red state we always screw the little guy
7,0,0,Is your mother sure this will help me shovel off the pounds?
7,1,0,To the confident, son, size doesn’t matter.
7,1,0,El Nino made me do it
8,0,1,It's a metaphor, son. Figure it out.
7,2,0,Are you sure you still want the big shovel?
7,0,0,Looks like we each had a coupon at the Shoddy Shovel Shop.
10,0,2,Just think son, when you're my age this will all be water.
9,1,1,You have the advantages in life that I didn't.
8,2,0,Typical government overreach
10,4,2,I'm more about the process.
7,1,0,For the last time, I'm sorry I forced you to take your allowance in shovels.
7,0,0,Today is 'Opposite Day'.
7,0,0,It's okay, no need to help, it's just stuck in snow.
7,1,0,You realize there's an app for that. Right?
7,0,0,Whoever said life was fair?
8,3,0,OK, your turn again.
7,0,0,You just finished 'Tom Sawyer' ? How did you like it ?
7,0,0,It's not the size-it's the motion.
8,3,0,One day when you are older Daddy will let you use the little shovel.
7,0,0,It's not the size that counts. It's how well you use it.
7,0,0,It's time you learned about working for senior management.
7,1,0,New iShovel?
8,2,0,See!? It's all in the wrist.
8,0,1,What? You said a little help.
7,0,0,Great job, honey. Now go inside and get the saltshaker.
7,0,0,I'll get a Nobel Prize for this.
8,0,1,Sometimes, size does matter.
7,0,0,your app! better than mine!
9,1,0,That's it. Aim high.
7,0,0,Oh, now! When I was just your age, they gave me this paint-scraper. Do you hear me whining?
10,1,2,I've got an idea....
7,0,0,Hey kid face it, you lost the coin toss.
7,0,0,DID I TELL YOU MY DIET DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING EITHER?
7,0,0,I told you. It's not the size that counts; it's how you use it.
7,2,0,It's the shovel that makes the man...
8,3,1,It's an artisanal snow scoop.
7,1,0,Hey kid, get off my lawn.
7,2,0,Gosh! We finally got into the caption contest but the illustration is so ambiguous that nobody can figure out what to write. That's not funny.
8,0,0,No Dad, not until you tell me where babies really come from.
7,1,0,So just like this for forty feet and repeat.
8,4,0,Son, I've been doing it this way since I was five.
7,1,0,Why Are You Shoveling? It's Going to be 50 Degrees Tomorrow.
7,0,0,It was his last bet.
7,0,0,Effort and technique matter more than size.
7,0,0,No wonder you're being bullied in school.
8,2,0,I'm only two months into my subscription to Dollar Shovel Club.
7,0,0,Don't like the coin flip idea.
7,1,0,No, thank you. I promised your mother I would reduce my carbon footprint.
7,0,0,I'm still wining Big Boy!
7,1,0,I smell a sitcom!
7,0,0,As soon as I'm done shoveling, I'll come help you with the well.
7,0,0,Believe me it's better than a bar mitzvah, and heck of a lot cheaper! Mazel tov, son.
7,0,0,Snow shoveling is not in the Winter Olympics but your scoop looks good.
7,0,0,What makes you think, that I'm trying to avoid you?
7,0,0,I'm more of a details guy
7,0,0,O K, kiddo, last pitch.
7,1,0,Maybe it's still not too late for law school.
7,0,0,Frank discovers that size does not matter.
7,1,0,Hey dad, we've been out here doing our sidewalk for 6 hours, can I go in now?
7,0,0,May I please please please go over to the Johanssens' house now? They just got a snowblower.
8,4,0,What matters is how you use it.
7,0,0,"Now you understand that size doesn't matter. It's what you do with the tool you have," he explained to his son with the full knowledge that if genetics were to be trusted, it was a lesson he would use again later in life.
7,0,0,Hey!, you wanted the big shovel
7,1,0,Complain softly and carry a big shovel.
7,0,0,I'm making the heart attack wait.
6,1,0,No more calling 'Shotgun'
7,0,0,You are so disappointing.
8,0,1,No, Tommy. Today we're working on your fine motor skills.
7,0,0,'Mama's calling'
7,0,0,No thanks Hun. The lack of NFL has unleashed the Sisyphus in me.
7,0,0,On second thought, I would like to switch shovels.
10,0,2,Sisyphus who!
7,0,0,Jack Sprat thought it was time to mix things up
9,4,1,See - it's not the size of the shovel, it's how well you use it.
7,0,0,Are you really sure you want to trade the easy job for the hard job?
7,0,0,Don't suppose you're one of those honey-eating bears...
7,1,0,Hey Stanley, I'm thinking that maybe we should trade shovels?
8,2,0,Some day, you'll look back and resent me
8,4,0,You do the grunt work. I'll do the edges.
9,1,1,Size matters? Ha!
7,0,0,Sometimes, size really doesn't matter.
7,0,0,you know what they say about a man with a big shovel
7,1,0,Again Son ... it's all about perspective.
8,6,0,It's a Daddy heart attack preventer.
7,0,0,Now you shovel the side walk.
6,0,0,Not with my bad back.
7,0,0,Did you find the kids yet?
7,0,0,Listen, kid. Someone gave you a snow job.
8,2,0,Yes, I am the guy you saw last July cutting his lawn with scissors. Why do you ask?
6,0,0,"It's quite simple: Quality over Quantity.
7,1,0,How's Freaky Friday working out for you so far?
7,0,0,O Canada
7,1,0,Kinda symbolic, ain't it?
7,1,0,Son, don’t think for a minute that I haven’t learned a thing or two from my years working for the government.
7,0,0,See how easy Daddy makes it look?
7,1,0,I have no idea what you mean by 'economy of scale'.....
7,1,0,Mine has GPS and voice guidance assistance.
7,0,0,YOU...ARE...THE 99 PERCENT!
7,0,0,Boy, That Sriracha Ice Melt works wonders
7,0,0,Life ain't fair, so there!
9,1,1,Mom sent me out to tell you she lied; size DOES matter...
7,1,0,Away troll, I'm not throwing my back out again.
7,1,0,Never mind. I'm in no hurry.
9,2,1,Government-run snow removal.
7,0,0,Ah, the patter of little feet around the house. There’s nothing like having a midget for a butler.
7,1,0,Let this be a lesson to you--always choose the 1% shovel.
7,0,0,See. It doesn't matter how big it is.
7,0,0,Thanks for all your help son
9,2,1,I used to work at Ben & Jerry's
9,4,1,Don't get too optimistic about your lemonade sales.
7,1,0,I really hate my job.
8,3,0,And then she has the nerve to accuse me of always taking the good pillow.
7,1,0,Kids today. They want everything right away.
8,2,0,My doctor prescribed this one.
8,1,0,That was grandpa's, may he rest in peace.
6,0,0,Hey, I let you pick first.
9,1,1,It's really about economies of scale
8,4,0,I really don't want to go to work.
9,1,1,I'll pay you double to cover the car up again.
7,0,0,It's not the size of the shovel that counts,It's the size behind the shovel."
7,0,0,i have a feeling were in michigan
8,2,0,Sorry, I was using it to clear my Legos.
7,1,0,My ex- was right. It does count.
7,1,0,I think the guy at the hardware store's interpretation of the democratic primary is a little crude.
7,0,0,You'll be sorry when you're a grandfather someday...
7,0,0,Don't forget that tonight I get the big bed with Mommy.
7,0,0,This debunks that myth…size doesn't matter.
6,0,0,Now I Know What They Mean By : Shoveling It Against The Tide !
9,2,1,I would swap shovels with you but my sciatica wont let me.
7,0,0,I think the Post Office screwed up on our delivery again!
7,1,0,Hey, these aren't my glasses.
7,0,0,First life lesson for you son. "Size does not matter". And if you don't believe me, ask your mom.
7,0,0,New item! At Costco.
8,2,0,No, I don't think this is funny!
9,2,1,See, this little one works just fine. Now why don't you try?
7,1,0,Euclid called it an extreme and mean ratio, if you remember.
7,0,0,I'm almost done!
8,3,0,It's not the size of the shovel that counts, it's in the wrist motion.
7,0,0,Ned thinks to himself, if I have the right tools and cooperation we can keep this path open and safe.
7,0,0,It's not a race...Zippy!
7,0,0,It would be so nice if you weren't here.
8,2,0,"This is part of my new exercise regimen".
7,1,0,Buy your shovel for 5 bucks, kid?
6,1,0,I strive for quality, son. Not quantity.
9,1,1,I've been reading a lot of Aesop lately
8,3,0,Objects are larger than they appear
7,1,0,When you're married you'll understand.
7,0,0,This is a direct result of "outcomes to efforts".
8,4,0,Keep it. I'm paid by the hour.
7,0,0,Ok, Son...Daddy's turn to be middle manager.
7,0,0,The cold truth about perspective.
7,2,0,It saves work. When I use this tiny shovel, the snow always melts before I finish the job.
8,3,0,No Sisyphus, and I don't want to hear that kind of talk from you ever again!
6,1,0,Brownie, you're doing a heckuva job.
7,0,0,Can you finish drawing this cartoon so I can see the punchline
8,3,0,Let's charge by the hour.
7,0,0,No. Perspective just makes it look small.
7,0,0,Your mother would approve, only just don't tell her.
9,0,1,Theres gotta be a Polar Bear under here somewhere.
7,0,0,Mom wants her spoon back.
9,0,1,I'm being paid by the hour.
7,0,0,I'm telling you man, it's not the size of the shovel that matters...
7,0,0,Damn Walter, back at it again with the snow shoveling.
7,0,0,Don't you know how to use that big shovel son?
7,0,0,Mom said the walk needs to be shoveled but my doctor told me not to push heavy snow around.
7,0,0,Stop with your lying Billy, my shovel is much huger than yours.
7,0,0,See what I can do with a little tool?
7,0,0,Son, did you ghost write the Art of the Deal?
7,1,0,But don't start thinking you're too big to fail!
7,1,0,Linda's biggest mistake in life was reassuring her husband that size doesn't matter.
7,0,0,Take that back to your mother -- it's more fun using this one.
7,0,0,Puh, millenials.
7,0,0,Hey Stan, I've been meaning to ask you to join my Linkedin network?
7,1,0,You know, son, it wasn't too long ago, that I would have needed that big shovel for a job like this. Now I can do it all with my smart phone.
7,0,0,How...how long have you been watching?
7,0,0,It's how you use the tool not the size
7,1,0,No, son. I use that shovel when I'm being paid by the job rather than by the hour.
6,0,0,As I told you during our talk, size doesn't matter.
7,0,0,Sometimes in life son size really doesn't matter.
7,1,0,Who says that size matters
10,0,1,I can't stay warm using the big shovel.
9,2,1,I hear these new shovels pose less of a heart attack risk.
8,2,0,Because anything worth having is worth working hard for it.
7,1,0,You should see the driveway
7,0,0,We can use this snow day to learn more about capitalism, son.
7,0,0,Sure, I'm a sadistic little bastard, but at least I can clear my browser history.
7,0,0,No thanks. This is the least I can do . . . and I always enjoy doing the least I can do!
9,3,1,No matter what your mother says, size does matter.
7,0,0,OK..you win, clap and switch.
7,0,0,Sure, heavy weights are an option but, I choose light weight and repetition!
7,0,0,That's the problem in this family. Our perspective is all messed up.
7,0,0,I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow.
7,0,0,Honey, we're getting paid by the hour.
7,1,0,Don't judge a shovel by its size.
6,0,0,There's an app for that?
7,0,0,Is that a lawn gnome or just a really small man?
7,0,0,It only looks bigger because you're so small!
7,0,0,Let me guess—you're voting for Bernie.
8,2,0,Son, I know it takes a little longer but I find a spatula to be more precise.
7,0,0,Big guys little spoons, little guys big spoons!
8,4,0,Mine has a smaller carbon footprint.
7,0,0,Happy "freaky Friday" George!
7,1,0,No, that's the litter scoop.
8,2,0,It is not the size thay counts, but how you use it!
8,2,0,You see, son, the importance of tool size is just a myth.
7,0,0,Damn Roy, when you started shoveling the snow, you were 5ft 7 inches tall! Now look at you! I need a drink, fast!
7,0,0,That's what she said.
7,2,0,If I made it easy for you, that would be socialism.
7,1,0,Mac wondered if they'd had more than one child would he still be using the sand castle shovel to clear the walk.
7,0,0,... it's what you do with it.
7,0,0,I think you are pushing the envelope on this delegation deal, Dad.
8,1,0,I agree, Art, but the doctor said humor her, and she's still watching.
7,0,0,Its not just about the size of the shovel!
7,1,0,Just follow my example and we'll be done in no time.
7,0,0,I get paid so much a shovel full....how about you
7,0,0,Undefeated! My snow spatula once again vanquishes your snow shovel. Boo-Yah!
7,0,0,I've got your back.
8,4,0,I told you; low weight, high reps!
7,1,0,It's called Crossfit.
8,2,0,This is how the social security trust fund works boy. You put in that much, so I can keep taking out this much.
7,1,0,My boss says I need to be more mindful.
7,0,0,When you are my age, think what you'll be able to tell your kids you did when you were their age.
7,0,0,He with the largest shovel clears the way only for himself.
8,0,1,Again you want to trade shovels?
8,8,0,"Your mother said we should be spending more time together".
7,1,0,Told ya. It's not how big it is, it's how you use it.
7,0,0,When you grow up, I promise you can use the little shovel.
7,0,0,Because sometimes it's nice NOT to use the one-size-fits-all option.
9,1,1,Well ? What's holding you up ?
8,3,0," Now you show up, where were you 11 hours ago"?
7,0,0,If you think that's too large,
9,8,1,Thanks, but this is my way of avoiding election coverage.
7,0,0,You could have helped.
7,0,0,Your wife also likes it bigger.
7,0,0,I hear hot chocolate calling, son. Please tell me you hear it too.
9,0,1,Sorry, but I need the small shovel for precision digging.
10,8,2,Your mother doesn't want me hurt. Only humiliated.
7,0,0,I know what you're compensating for.
8,3,0,Do you know you're an entitled little bastard?
7,0,0,Little, big. Big, little
8,2,0,My fitness goal is to tell my FB followers it took me 10,000 steps to dig out.
7,1,0,Life inside the snow globe had become too predictable.
9,2,1,...And, yes, it was uphill both ways.
7,0,0,Need a little help?
9,5,1,' Son, when your mother gets like that, this is how you create a little me-time.'
7,0,0,No thanks, I rather savour doing it my way
8,0,1,This is one of those Goldilocks moments.
8,2,0,So now they're making iShovels bigger?
7,0,0,It's not the size of the shovel, but the speed in your heave.
7,1,0,Where's your pail? I want to take a bath later.
9,2,1,No thanks--I've joined the slow movement.
7,0,0,It's the economy stupid
7,1,0,It's all in the wrist, and I have the touch!
9,0,1,There's no art in a big brush, either!
8,2,0,No, Son, I'm saving that shovel for the next round of the debates.
7,0,0,Just follow my lead. It's called style over substance.
9,2,1,It's not the size of the shovel with the man, it's the size of the man with the shovel!
7,0,0,Don't believe women who tell you that size doesn't matter.
7,0,0,I'm tired of these kids clearing out the stores before we can even get to them. And then they can't even use what they bought.
6,0,0,The wrong eyeglasses again?
7,1,0,Mom said yours wasn't big enough. I assumed she meant the shovel.
8,4,0,I told you switching wouldn't make you any happier.
7,0,0,Oh, no -- that was last year; it's the neighbor's turn.
7,1,0,I'll give you mine if you give me yours.
7,0,0,This snow removal app is amazing!
7,0,0,2016: A mini-shovel-using parallel universe is saved from oblivion by the appearance of the child prophet.
7,0,0,I don't want to look like I'm overcompensating.
9,0,1,Body image issues?
7,1,0,So old-school
7,0,0,"Heart-healthy California Walnuts" to you, too!
7,0,0,Didn't I tell you on your first birthday that life wasn't fair?
7,1,0,Where's you ox, Paul?
7,1,0,I'd rather be grilling.
7,0,0,I'm practicing for the civil service exam.
10,2,2,Now you know what it's like to be a man.
7,1,0,Repeat after me; "Government contract!"
8,2,0,Go see if Mom has warmed your cocoa, and remind her I'd like my reward shaken...
7,0,0,Would you call this the Jonas Brothers?
7,0,0,Mom's got her glasses on backwards again.
9,2,1,Shut-up! I did the walkway to the house with this.
8,2,0,You just have to put your back in it, son!
7,0,0,You know, it's not the size of your shovel that matters, it is how you use it.
7,2,0,Remember, one small scoop at a time.
8,3,0,Because when I started, all I could find was 'Malibu Barbie's beach shovel'
7,0,0,Can I get you an orange syrup?
10,0,2,Too want your father to avoid a massive heart attack, don't you?
7,0,0,Thanks son, that would be faster, but then Daddy would be telling fibs to his boss about not being able to get in to work all week.
7,1,0,I'm paid by the hour how about you?
8,1,0,It makes me feel closer to my ex-wife.
5,0,0,Stop your bitching--I keep telling you that you need to lift weights at the gym
7,1,0,No, this doesn't mean you can trade your twin bed for my king-size bed.
7,1,0,This is not a trick, son, I'm just in my second childhood.
7,0,0,Next time like usual, sonny. See, here's the SCOOP: If I get home in time, the missus insists we go to the Trump rally... .
7,0,0,Your seem quite happy with that bat!
9,2,1,My shovel's not really that small; it's just drawn that way.
7,1,0,I just heard spring is right around the corner.
7,0,0,You oughta be in snow business!
8,2,0,I told you, it's the technique that counts.
7,0,0,Too large, too late.
7,0,0,I'm gonna miss this stuff.
8,2,0,Watch me carefully, son, I'm about to teach you the value of pointless toil.
7,1,0,No, I am not micromanaging.
7,0,0,Ladies and gentlemen the next president of the United States in Donald J. Trump
9,0,2,Tell Mom I'll watch the debates as soon as I finish shoveling.
7,0,0,Hey, dad, can I have my shovel back?
9,3,1,You said you're a big boy.
7,1,0,You're not getting much leverage. Grab it closer to the handle.
7,0,0,Still don't want to trade?
8,3,0,Well, you got to use it at the beach last summer.
7,1,0,'Of course size matters!'
7,1,0,You see son, this is what balance of power means!
7,0,0,I suppose there was an app for that, too.
7,0,0,Eek Gad, Junior!? You'll get a heart attack!
7,0,0,Get used to it, kid. This is how Social Security works.
8,2,0,I'm going to package it up and sell it to hipsters as "artisinal hand-shoveled" snow.
7,1,0,Yes, I promise to put it back in your sand box when I finish.
7,1,0,Now can Daddy have his wallet back?
9,1,1,Stop complaining. When I was a boy I used my hands - until they amputated the right one.
10,3,2,You'll understand one day when YOUR mother-in-law is visiting.
7,0,0,Thanks, Jimmy. I'll take it from here.
7,0,0,Are you sure they gave us the right tools??
7,0,0,If you do the sidewalk, I'll build the snowman.
8,3,0,It's your perspective.
7,1,0,Mom wants her spatula back!
7,0,0,You ARE the best snow shoveler in the whole, wide world, Tommy! Now can we trade back?
8,1,0,My shovel is half full
7,0,0,You win this round, ballbag.
8,4,0,Stop whining about losing the coin-toss
7,1,0,Mom said either way you're going to grandma's.
7,0,0,It affords more precision.
8,0,1,Top one-tenth of the top one per cent?
7,1,0,Think lose-lose.
7,1,0,Son, you know that's our display shovel.
7,0,0,Get the drift?
7,0,0,Compensating much?
7,0,0,You're right, Honey. Size really doesn't matter.
7,1,0,Miley's here.
8,3,0,That's not cardiologist approved, son.
9,2,1,Stop shoving it over to my side.
9,0,1,Thanks for offering, but I'm getting paid by the hour.
9,1,0,When I was your age, even the snow banks looked huge.
7,0,0,Any other merit badges to work on after Community Service?
6,1,0,Bend at the knees, not the waist.
9,2,1,What's the sport in that?
8,2,0,You're the one who wanted to change shovels!
7,1,0,Next I'll show him how to play Ping-Pong.
7,1,0,Remember, my boy, it's not the size of your shovel but how much Elvis is in your pelvis...
7,0,0,Bite me!
7,1,0,This is almost as frustrating as the New Yorker caption contest
7,1,0,'Six hours, almost done, my back's killing me and NOW you're Mr. Wise Guy ?'
8,2,0,No thank you my son, I'm deeply devoted to my minimalism
7,1,0,And remember that when you talk to girls
7,1,0,Well, this experience has certainly given me a new perspective.
7,1,0,Remember this, "Bigger isn't always better".
7,1,0,You see son, size really doesn't matter.
7,0,0,"Get out of the well. Stop playing with that ceiling roller and give me a help".
7,1,0,Son, you are all shovel, no snow.
10,5,2,Tell your mother I'll be in to meet her parents when I'm done.
9,1,1,You kids and your newfangled technology.
7,1,0,... and toss.
7,1,0,I'm sorry you think this is a snow job."
7,1,0,Put that away, we are paid by the hour.
7,0,0,We'll discuss increasing your allowance later.
7,0,0,Always have the right tool for the job, son. That's what my daddy taught me.
7,0,0,You're path-etic!
7,0,0,Say son, choke up on it a little.
7,0,0,At least you do not have to mow the lawn for a while.
7,1,0,Because I'm wearing my Fitbit.
7,0,0,My, aren't we passive-aggressive today.
7,0,0,And that, my boy, is what "Capitalism" is all about. You just keep shoveling, see, and I come back later to reap the benefits.
7,0,0,I see you've found the pool.
7,0,0,You should see my umbrella.
7,0,0,Arthur King thanked Mrs. Lake's stepson for his timely gift.
7,0,0,Should have castled earlier !
9,1,1,Kids these days are so spoiled.
7,0,0,A tale of two shovels.
7,0,0,Chip off the "old block", once removed.
7,1,0,Just how many more snow cones are you planning on making, son?
9,2,1,No ! No ! No ! I'll dig out grandma .
7,0,0,Switching shovels would be more productive, but your Mother wanted it this way and she's the boss.
8,2,0,It's all about the reps.
11,0,0,Back in my day, there was no such thing as "physically impossible".
7,0,0,There's more to inequality than just income
7,1,0,Because the hard way builds character, Timmy.
7,0,0,You are a little boy who needs a big shovel so he can grow up to be a man who gives himself the small one
12,10,4,My cardiologist sells them.
7,2,0,I told you, I prefer incremental change.
7,0,0,I told you: It's speed, and not size, that matter.
7,1,0,See it's easy...I'm sick and tired of little people like you complaining all the time!
7,0,0,Absolutely that's Santa's shovel!
7,0,0,This is analogous to an argument I always have with your mom about size.
7,0,0,When you finish the lawn, I'll fix you a sno-cone.
7,0,0,Your mother told you size matters, didn't she.
7,2,0,You can do a lot with a little.
9,3,0,I could have used you three weeks ago.
7,0,0,When will you learn that size doesn't matter?!
7,0,0,Yes, job-creation is a bitch
7,0,0,Yes I overcompensate. People with small shovels often do.
9,2,1,See? Just lift with your knees.
9,2,1,That's only your perspective.
7,1,0,You shovel the snow. I’m curating it.
7,1,0,Mom says size doesn't matter.
7,0,0,School starts next month.
7,0,0,It's heavy because it's filled with hopes and dreams
7,0,0,Good "d" but I'm doin' the alley-oop for the second floor.
8,2,0,Yes it's lighter but I'm doing more reps
7,0,0,The little guys always have the biggest toys.
7,1,0,See what whistling while you work will do for you?
7,1,0,This would be a funny New Yorker cartoon.
7,0,0,Dear lord, it wasn't funny the first time...
7,0,0,Gee Dad, the weatherman didn't mean to shovel just one or two inches.
9,3,1,Your back hurts? What about my wrist?
7,2,0,No matter what your Mom says, size doesn't matter.
7,0,0,Want to borrow mine
9,2,1,Why do I always have to clean up after you?
9,2,1,Next time I get to be the grown up.
8,3,0,Technically, I don't think we're violating any OSHA rules.
7,0,0,Hey dad, you know you don't have Scalia on the Court to protect your rights anymore.
7,0,0,Just going to make sure that washing powder commercial is kosher.
7,0,0,let's switch shovels.
7,0,0,In progress: A snow life mural
9,0,1,See jack, it's not the size that matters its the way you use it
7,1,0,I suppose you're still using a landline too.
7,0,0,Let's have a fair exchange.
9,1,1,The problem is you're holding it wrong.
7,0,0,You should do that my way.
8,2,0,Sometimes size does matter, Fred...
7,1,0,We do Common Core later!!!
7,0,0,these kids are early adapters
7,1,0,Perspective matters!
7,0,0,Son, remember quality trumps quantity when offering bespoke snowflake removal services.
7,0,0,It's easy if you put your legs into it, like this
8,2,0,How much more is it again for the shovel upgrade?
7,0,0,the smaller the tool the more you put into it
7,1,0,It's not the size of the shovel. It's the volume of fried beans.
7,0,0,I'm going to make an abominable snowman.
7,1,0,The doctor said it's best for my heart.
7,1,0,It's in the wrist.
7,1,0,Next you will be demanding a snow blower.
8,2,0,Daddy has to micromanage everything.
7,0,0,I guess it is the motion in the ocean!
7,0,0,I can only imagine what he's going to be like as a teenager.
7,0,0,Now who's the one-percenter?
7,0,0,This is what happens when shovels are issued according to need!
8,2,1,This way is more artisanal.
7,1,0,Remember son slow and steady wins the race.
7,0,0,Honey, stop pitching. I told you, this isn't a bat!
7,1,0,Pathfinder. Please.
7,0,0,See how I use my knees, and not my back, to put the snow in the neighbor's yard?
7,0,0,Granny. It's not the size of what you have, but what you do with what you have.
7,0,0,Looks like we have a future President of the United States in the family.
7,0,0,Son you must realize age and wisdom will always win over youth!
9,1,1,When they tell you that size doesn't matter, don't you believe 'em.
9,1,1,Gotta get to the main roads 'cause I can't take another day of school called off for snow.
7,1,0,Found it!
7,0,0,Your mother is completely off base, son. Size doesn't matter.
7,1,0,Thanks, son, this one's fine.
7,2,0,It's not about quantity...it's about quality.
7,0,0,Remember to lift with you knees!
10,3,2,No Thanks - I'm trying to beat mom's Fitbit total
9,0,1,Holler when you find Jimmy Hoffa
7,0,0,Well the weatherman said two inches, that's enough outta you
7,0,0,My purpose? My purpose is to make a man of you.
8,2,0,Not, I don't have snow shovel envy
7,0,0,Sad news...my hamster just died. So, how's your pet tiger doing?
7,1,0,No two Flakes are alike!
7,0,0,....and that's the difference between Hillary and Bernie's campaign funding strategies.
7,1,0,Wanna trade?
7,0,0,Really? Where was it?
7,1,0,I think I took her "size doesn't matter" too broadly.
7,0,0,'This is a sample of asymmetrical warfare.'
7,0,0,Put that back until your grandmother leaves.
8,4,0,It's not the about destination it's about the journey
7,0,0,Soon as we're done here, we'll switch shovels, and I'll bash your head in.
10,2,2,It builds character!
7,1,0,You should pay attention to the details...
7,0,0,Yes Son, nothing seems as it was since Trump.
7,0,0,xx
7,0,0,It's from Costco, duh.
7,0,0,Here she is son... I'll dig her out.
8,2,0,Must get 10,000 steps......
7,0,0,Apple's shoveling more than snow with the iShovel!
8,3,0,Because I'm management, that's why.
7,1,0,"978,979....I was right Mr. Know it all. It takes your shovel more scoops than....heeeeyyyy
7,0,0,The world isn’t fair . . . or efficient.
7,0,0,I still can't tell if size matters!
7,0,0,The question isn't who let me take your shovel; it's who is going to stop me.
7,0,0,Last one in is a rotten egg
7,2,0,Hank and Ernie simultaneously develop a bad case of shovel envy.
7,0,0,I thought you like pretend games.
7,0,0,Chill out, it's just snow buddy. No pun intended.
7,0,0,Are you sure you don't want to trade shovels?
7,1,0,Which song would you like to sing next? "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall", or "If You're Happy & You Know It, Clap Your Hands"?
9,3,1,You should have seen the shovel your grandfather used
7,0,0,What do you mean "small"? It's technique that matters, not size.
7,0,0,At this rate, I should get some help from the thaw come April.
7,0,0,Son you got a big shovel that's for sure but if you don't push I'll beat your tush!
7,0,0,Watch how I do it Son. This is just one of many techniques I have for staying married to your mother.
7,0,0,Shovel size means nothing.
8,1,0,That's not a shovel, this is a shovel.
7,2,0,Remember son, it's not the size of the shovel, it's the motion
9,2,1,Don't blame the tool, son.
7,0,0,Can you hand me the strawberry syrup please?
7,0,0,"Bring your child to work day" for shovelers? Never again!
6,0,0,OK. It's your turn. Bring your shovel and come and help Daddy.
8,0,1,Wanna swap hats?
7,1,0,Keep at it, Mom. I'm sure my little pail is down there somewhere.
7,0,0,This would be easier if you used the spoon & I used the shovel.
7,0,0,Not what I expected when you said I could trade for new hand tools.
7,0,0,It's called haute scoop-ture.
9,0,1,Less disappointment when the plow comes by.
7,0,0,I don't think you're trying
7,0,0,I am leaving, going to Florida
7,0,0,It's speak softly and carry a big STICK
7,1,0,After an hour or so, we'll switch shovels again.
9,3,1,Son, you won't create many jobs doing it like that.
7,0,0,I don't know if this is the right lesson, Bob.
7,1,0,No. I don't think snow is mentioned in the Bible.
7,0,0,Don't forget the roof!
7,0,0,Let this be a lesson: It’s not how big it is, it’s what you do with it.
7,0,0,Would you believe I have a bigger Johnson.
8,5,0,I'll take it! This one's just about used up.
7,0,0,Keep shoveling!!
7,2,0,It's the only one I own.
7,1,0,This new app is great !
7,0,0,Precision and follow through get you better distance than brute strength!
7,1,0,You'll learn. My father died of a heart attack.
8,2,0,No thanks, son. I enjoy a more intimate contact with snow,
8,2,0,Inefficiencies of scale.
7,0,0,No, you little dweeb, size does NOT matter.
7,1,0,Get out of here kid, I get paid by the hour.
7,0,0,You'll understand when you're married, Son.
8,0,1,Put that back, it violates the HOA's 'Small Community' theme.
8,2,0,Who does your contracts?
9,1,0,This looks good Junior. Now it's time we tackle that roof.
8,2,0,There are no shortcuts to success, son.
7,0,0,Marty got the extra large because he had something to prove.
7,1,0,Don't be a Sisyphus.
7,0,0,Millennials...
7,0,0,We'll get more done when Mom gets here
6,1,0,Started yesterday morning.
7,0,0,I guess you're right. Every family has one over achiever and a one under achiever.
9,2,1,I'll get some here, son. You can clear out the rest.
7,0,0,Son, Monday morning is a very bad time to renegotiate your compensation with the boss.
7,0,0,Feel free...
7,0,0,All that work to die a virgin!
7,1,0,Shovelry is dead.
7,1,0,It's what the 1% call fair and balanced.
8,3,0,It's not the size of the shovel, son, but the speed of the deed.
7,0,0,Looks like you could use a little help
7,1,0,Go tell your Mom, that just because she found our snow shovel, does not mean I need to use it.
7,0,0,Lift with your knees, Pops!
7,1,0,Maybe there's a better way to do this, Phil.
7,0,0,Like I said, you were very fortunate to use the large snow shovel after I fliped the coin. Heads you won and tails I lost.
7,1,0,I found him on Angie's List
7,0,0,It's not the size of the wave, it's motion of the ocean.
7,1,0,Still working on that first shovel full?
7,1,0,I said do your best to make Dad look "athletic" not "pathetic".
7,1,0,You said you wanted equality of opportunity
7,0,0,Do the math Mr Mensa. THEN lecture me again about this making a mountain out of a mole hill thing!
11,4,3,Want to trade again?
7,0,0,Nothing is going to stop me from getting The New Yorker delivered!
