19,4,0,C’mon, Billy. Let’s go play in a virtual sandbox.
19,0,1,So that's what it looks like when you eat kitty litter.
29,15,3,Should we tell him we already found the ring?
25,6,2,Okay, your dad’s convinced me, an Endless Swimming Pool would be way more fun than our Endless Sandbox.
18,3,0,Should we tell your Dad he's not a cat & that isn't the litter box?
19,1,0,Dad fell off the wagon again, he's trying to dry out
26,6,2,Ten years in a cubicle will do that.
22,1,2,Good job Tommy !
18,3,0,Garden mirage

16,1,0,All these years he insists he's a camel exploring the desert.
31,12,4,My dad can't think outside the box.
15,0,0,Corporate burnout. Way too many hours playing well in the sandbox.
18,3,0,Beat it pal, you're going to have to think outside the sandbox.

25,2,1,It's his version of a desert survival simulator.
37,12,7,Talk about a first world problem.
16,0,0,Maybe he thinks it is human litter.
18,3,0,Would you prefer a rocking horse with no name?
22,2,0,Dad always said "It's a jungle out there"
25,3,0,Okay, it's settled. You'll tell him he's in the wrong cartoon.

17,1,0,He'll never find water thinking inside the box.
32,8,6,Honestly, I don't mind if dad thinks he's a cat. It's the clean-up I'm having a problem with.
32,6,5,Water? Are you kidding? We should build a wall.
24,1,1,Is he homeless or going to the beach?
16,2,0,Desert flashback.
33,0,1,He wanted to bum a skylight.
17,1,0,Betcha his favorite song is: "If I could tun back time"
20,6,0,We need an adult in the sandbox like a fish needs a bicycle.
29,0,0,sometimes its hard to help someone who's miserable that you just have to watch them from afar

23,6,1,He says it helps him think.
43,20,10,Where are his parents?
18,0,1,A new Bansky-inspired art installation has just popped up today entitled, "Wilson, where are you?"
15,0,0,He says it's method acting prep on a budget
17,1,0,When are these darn poppies going to start to grow?
15,0,0,I think he said my caption might save him.
21,2,1,By a stroke of luck, he got here first.
18,3,0,He hasn't had a juice box in three days.
19,4,0,Don't mind him. He's insane.

22,4,1,First the cats were wrecking my fun and now this.
26,7,1,Ya think he'll get out if we put the cat in with him?
22,4,1,I call it 'Soul of Wall Street.'
19,4,0,I guess marketing's already thinking about the Californian campaign.
21,4,1,I think they call it 'failure to launch'
18,3,0,He's really got to start thinking out of the box!
20,4,0,I guess if You hang around the Cat Litter Box long enough, You are going to end up using it.
19,1,0,I guess that we shouldn't play with his smart phone in the sand box.
26,6,2,He should think outside the box.
26,3,1,Finally, I made it to Flah-ri-da!
22,8,0,He needs a small palm tree to make it more realistic.
20,3,1,Tell me again why we volunteered to keep the sandbox clean.
34,9,7,Ah, looking for the grain of truth.
20,5,0,This Living Art business is getting old.
31,13,4,Our other amenity is a resistance pool.
22,7,0,The struggle is real…
19,2,0,I think the cat's got his tongue.
18,1,0,I think he calls it Sun Salutation.

17,2,0,I know my cat's in here Somewhere!! MEOW MEOW!!!
31,12,4,I just can't get him to think outside the box.
17,2,0,Don't worry. Dad can only do 10 minutes in the endless desert.
17,2,0,I prefer a timeout rather than cleaning out the box.
26,9,2,Flat or sparkling?
20,4,0,I will sure be glad when his acting classes are over.
22,5,1,I guess you have to do more than think outside the box.
17,2,0,He is here until he learns to play well with others!
17,2,0,My Dad watched "Cast Away" on Netflix last night. Do you have a volleyball?
18,3,0,I told them putting a litter box out for public use was a bad idea!
18,0,1,He said it reminds him of parenting....
18,0,1,The children watch as Carl embraces his innermost felines...

16,2,0,Don't worry, we just have to wait until he figures out we're part of his hallucination.

16,0,0,I've heard about this new exercise craze. It's called the sandbox!
23,6,1,He mumbled something about losing his horse with no name.
33,6,7,Performance art pisses me off.
19,2,1,You don't understand performance art. Giving him water will only encourage him.
17,2,0,Buddy, this ain't no sand dune you're in downtown Minneapolis.
27,11,2,That's why I decided against contact lenses.
23,2,1,I lost my contacts
38,5,1,He thinks it's the 1869 one cent coin a told him I lost -- it's a penny.
18,1,0,And you can add that Mark needs more than a haircut. He'll soon have a butt-crack problem!
32,12,5,I'm inclined not to tell the search party.
30,8,4,The wavy line over his head means he smells bad.
31,6,5,It seems that coloring books are the gateway drug.
20,2,1,These pollsters are getting desperate.

29,2,0,Tony said when the last one awakens the giant within we can go to Chili's for happy hour
28,12,4,We really are getting the full New York experience at this Airbnb.
24,0,3,I think our Crossing the Border Simulation will be sure to speak to Trump supporters.
13,0,0,Should we point out the Korean Bodega on East 86th?
27,2,0,The poor guy sees a mirage.
18,3,0,There goes the neighborhood.

23,7,1,I hope he makes it.
21,7,0,Method actor.
18,4,0,Art is so strange these days.
23,4,1,Think he'll die soon?
22,2,1,You know, one man's trash is another man's treasure.
63,41,22,Of all the sandboxes, on all the roofs, in all the world, he crawls into mine.
19,1,1,Oh, so you think we should call it "Marriage"? Funny. I think we should call it "I'm Having an Affair with Your Brother."
26,9,2,It's part of a corporate retreat.
18,1,0,Don't look now but I think the man who says he'll do anything is about to draw a line in the sand.

19,1,1,He said it's called 'mooncrawling.'
22,1,2,I wish he'd start thinking outside the box.
36,13,6,He must think he's Lawrence of Suburbia
15,0,0,Hey dude, You're already out.
24,8,1,I don't know. I'd guess he's transitioning to house cat.
23,2,1,is that dad?
21,7,0,Are you seeing that too?
16,2,0,He says it's his sandbox and he'll crawl if he wants to.
30,4,5,This is why I'm not a fan of hot yoga.
16,1,0,Polictical regression is our last chance.
18,2,0,It's not so much that my Dad still thinks he's a cat, it's the cleanup that's killing me
23,0,1,I call dibbs on next.

31,9,7,It all started with those adult coloring books.
22,2,1,He needs to learn how to play better in the sandbox
35,16,6,Great. It's the "Occupy Sandbox" movement.
19,0,1,He does look a bit like Sideshow Bob.

45,21,10,He hasn't been the same since we sold our beach house.
16,1,0,What's the Fata Morgana here - the man in the sand or New York?
22,7,1,When Daddy said he had to go scratch in the litter box, I thought he was just going to the bathroom.
15,0,0,He recently finished reading ‘Find Yourself in the Desert’, but he will do anything to avoid those annoying baggage fees.
22,3,2,Should we set up the sprinkler?
22,5,1,Mom said the Condo Board made him get rid of his camel.
18,2,0,So your Dad is showing us how he played in the sand where he grew up?

22,1,0,Just five mom minutes. Pleeeease.
43,22,8,It's true! Without his phone he really is lost!

26,1,0,Are you certain you paid your taxes?
19,1,1,It's called mirage parenting.

27,4,2,He's practicing for a desert island Reality TV show.

17,2,0,It used to be harder to die in the desert...
25,4,2,Please tell me that this is just another mirage.
26,8,2,Marco!
22,3,2,Whew! He's Lawrence of Arabia, today. Since he's not Felix the Cat, we won't need the shovel and pail, after all.
15,0,0,Those are not the kind of vultures the boss was talking about attracting.
16,0,0,I call 'first dibs' on those snappy shoes.
30,12,3,Thinking back, he may have ordered a small *dessert*.
17,2,0,He was known as the 'Frac Sand King' before business dried up.
29,14,1,The Guggenheim passed this up?

20,3,1,Clearly, we all need to practice our "out of the box" thinking skills.
30,3,1,It looks like he's been here awhile. I'm going to run down and grab him a Pellegrino.

23,11,0,I remember what it felt like to sit through Ishtar

18,2,0,He texted me at 3 a.m. saying that he'll be at the beach. He was drunk.
16,1,0,Come on, Herbie! Make it look like you,ve crawled many miles.
17,2,0,People gripe about gentrification but the sandboxes still suck.
23,2,2,We're trying ashtray aversion therapy to cure his smoking habit. If that doesn't work, we'll show him photos of Bette Davis at eighty.
22,1,2,He lost his virginity in that sandbox.
29,8,4,He just can't think outside the box.
17,2,0,It was only a friendship ring.
18,2,0,A grown-up's playground: A (concrete) Sand B(l)ox
18,7,0,Your dad sure is determined to find his inner child.

18,0,1,It's the dreaded sandboxitus.

27,5,3,They say he's been in time out for 20 years.
22,1,2,Left my charger at home.
41,26,6,We'll put the lemonade stand here.
18,3,0,In the next scene my dad reenacts Lawrence's first meeting with Prince Faisal.
21,2,1,Immersive acting turned out to be cheaper than the Maserati.
21,5,0,Ironic, perhaps, but wouldn’t a bucket and shovel compromise the integrity of his message?
17,2,0,So.. What's taking so long?
17,1,0,Once dad has finished looking for gold nuggets, we can have our turn
22,5,1,He claims to be the sole surviving investor in 'Ishtar.'
25,6,0,He just moved from Arizona here to New York City. He says he does this when he gets home sick.

23,6,1,Three consecutive days of mom's tuna casserole and dad thinks he's a cat.
25,5,2,Patience. He's getting in touch with his inner cat.
20,2,1,Some obsession with a film about a soccer ball and some ice skates.
28,5,1,He prefers to be called an "independent."
17,2,0,What a playdate. Is your dad a Pisces?
21,9,0,We are evidently all part of an elaborate mirage.
16,2,0,Should we tell him we're not mirage or go play Xbox instead?
23,8,0,Shouldn't we tell Mommy?
21,1,0,I guess he won't mind the stray cats use this sandbox as a kitty litter!
19,1,1,I wish he would learn to play outside the box.
29,10,2,The cat won't be happy about this.
23,2,2,Next week we'll mountain climb on the HVAC unit.
19,1,1,It's OK. My drunk uncle thinks he's a cat.
23,3,2,So this is what you meant when you said beach day...
19,3,0,He's showing off.
15,0,0,I would say this man has belief issues.
17,2,0,This is why you should stretch yourself and play in others sandboxes
20,3,1,He keeps crying, "I'm SO sorry, Wilson..."
20,7,0,He said it's the latest physical fitness craze, Death Valley Crawl.
19,0,0,Maybe he is the Bernie Sanders my dad talks about ,and it's his pit now.
17,1,0,He worked with Jackson Pollock.. He may be a while.
21,2,1,I thought if I brought your father back to his childhood, he could better relate to your concerns. I guess he went back too far.
24,4,1,I told him days ago it's our turn.
29,10,4,I hope he's not a cat person!
20,2,1,This is getting weird. Let's go flip those pancakes.
37,14,6,He washed up on the Upper East Side
21,0,2,He got primaried.
20,2,1,I call it 'Training for Death Valley Marathon.'
17,2,0,Looks like Dad forgot to take his Risperdal again.
17,3,1,He just doesn't have time for beach weekends since the promotion.
22,3,1,He's prepping for the Death Valley Fun Run.
28,7,4,Burying your head in our sandbox won't make Trump disappear!
17,2,0,Is this some sort of warning?
23,6,1,I've always said that one man's mirage is just another man's déjà vu.
18,3,0,I thought the new diet craze was supposed to be 'dessert first'.

24,7,2,He needs a new therapist.
24,6,2,They call him'The Human Cigarette'.
16,0,0,No bucket. No spade. What else can he play?

16,1,0,I must have made a wrong turn somewhere!
25,11,1,His name is Lawrence
19,1,1,It would seem more like a day at the beach if we could wear our swimsuits.
18,1,0,After being bit by a rabid cat, Joe finds the bathroom in his semi catatonic state.
23,2,2,How long WERE you in timeout?
22,4,1,I hope this isn't going to be like when that cat was living here.
18,1,0,It's just his way of acting out some weird, survivalist fantasy.
24,2,3,Mom says you can come back inside now.
30,14,3,His problem is his inability to think outside the box.
20,2,1,He said he doesn't drink city water.
19,4,0,He likes his martinis very dry.
16,1,0,That was the biggest, pinkest cat ever. This is the guy Pay Pal's been missing.
18,3,0,It's a minimum wage job nowadays.
21,1,1,Hey Mister, do you wanna Red Bull?

22,5,2,He's gotta think outside the box.

16,1,0,He must be another method actor.
15,0,0,Promoted to executive sandbox, when the CFO learns to play nicely, we'll give him the pail and shovel.
27,12,2,He's out of the litter box, and that's all I really care about.
