34,4,0,What game are the kids playing again? Jumunja-something?
45,9,4,Do you think they were more fun in the barrel?
36,4,1,You said to trade in the Entertainment Center.

48,14,2,We never crated the dog. Why would we barrel these guys?
42,5,3,Where's the typewriter?
55,13,7,I told ancestry.com to unearth all leads.
41,9,2,One of them is not flushing!

37,5,1,"They're suppose to help keep the other delegates off my back during the convention".
88,44,19,How come they're only "my" monkeys when they're bad?
40,8,2,For this we filled the spare room with typewriters?
65,24,8,I think our first date went well.

42,7,1,They were far more fun in the barrel.
74,28,12,Your profile said you like Jane Goodall.
38,10,1,And the problem with the barrel was what?
39,7,1,I can take the noise. It's their scrutiny of everything I do that's driving me crazy.

64,27,9,But they were cheaper by the barrel.
44,6,3,The doctor and mama talked today and you all can't be jumpin' on the bed.
35,4,1,That's odd. Fred said sitting mindfully for five minutes calmed his monkey brain.
45,12,3,The doctor said no more monkeys on the bed. He didn't say anything about the living room.
35,3,1,I guess we should have stopped at 10.

63,3,0,They're just upset that Obama can't run for another term!
34,5,0,What do you mean you threw out the barrel?
51,9,5,I told you we need to build a wall and have Jane Goodall pay for it!
51,12,3,Can we just see if it's more fun?'
45,10,3,This is the biggest prize i've ever won.
43,14,1,No more play dates.

53,11,9,The heart wants what it wants.
62,21,8,Fine. I'll go get the barrel and return them.
56,13,7,So how long have you been on Match.com?
36,8,0,Maybe we should have stuck with rabbits.
65,3,0,I warned you that we were fine with just the one female monkey.
106,7,4,You said they'll be even more fun from outside the barrell

37,9,1,You said the house felt empty.
41,8,3,Trump's super delegates needed a place to stay.
35,2,1,I thought you said pets are less trouble than kids.
45,9,3,Did you leave the lid off the barrel?
28,2,0,What time is your appointment with the circus instructor?
44,14,2,I always bring them on dates. Is that a problem?

38,9,2,So you're telling me you said you wanted to "monkey around"?
61,11,10,Did you remember to get the typewriters too?
38,3,2,Does your family always have to be here for our weekly date night? We have been married for over 20 years!!!

46,2,0,Apparently we can't have a pet football team.
35,3,1,whats with all this monkey buisness?
43,8,3,You said I should do what makes me happy.
37,5,2,I didn't mean "more fun than a barrel full of monkeys" literally.
32,3,0,Was in absolutely necessary to order a whole barrel?
30,2,0,None of my previous dates appreciated how perceptive monkeys can be.
31,3,0,We have some serious relationship problems and the first one is how do we get rid of the monkeys!
60,20,7,What kind of business did you say you were in?
51,15,6,Trust me. There are no elephants in the room

31,2,1,gjhjk
36,2,2,They're completely useless since dropping out of the race.
32,1,1,Screw the doctor! I say let them jump on the bed.

36,6,1,Would you have preferred iguanas?
33,2,0,But what could be more fun than a barrell-full of monkeys?
78,37,15,I miss the elephant.
36,5,0,When did they stop jumping on the bed?
40,11,1,Maybe it's more fun when they stay in the barrel.
40,9,1,You hated being an empty nester. This should cheer you up.
52,21,4,Well. you told them they couldn't jump on the bed.

58,14,5,How many survey monkeys does it take to change a light bulb?
52,9,2,I don't think I can stand any more of your monkeying around
36,4,1,The chairman agreed to continue my research grant - but I have to look arter them on weekends.
50,13,5,That delivery of 100 typewriters is making more sense now.
38,6,1,The barrel was extra. It's still fun though.
72,30,11,You seem to be his favorite.
54,4,1,This job is killing me.
55,25,4,Please tell me you didn't recycle that barrel.
37,3,1,Mr.Whiskers just wasn't doing it for me.
50,3,1,The Good Wife and 12 Monkeys
47,7,1,It wasn't my idea to teach them photobombing.
72,28,15,Maybe what we need is another monkey.
40,11,1,At least he's off your back.
73,24,9,Daylight come and me wanna go home.
35,7,0,Pottery Barn had a special.
56,18,5,At least they aren't on your back.

40,6,3,At least they quit jumping on the bed.
36,7,1,I think they want their typewriters back.
68,39,3,But the offer was buy ten get one free
58,23,8,They had free two-day shipping.
46,9,4,Do you regret not having children?
52,23,3,You did say no cats...
69,18,4,I prefer seeing the presidential primary debates on the TV.
46,11,1,Enough of your Monkey Business!
56,21,6,I was sick of being called the cat lady.
37,6,0,Maybe you want to revisit "Having a baby will change our lives."

98,42,24,How much fun did you expect?
58,19,9,What did you think I meant when I said I wanted to monkey around?
37,7,1,No. We should not get a cat!
36,4,1,You know I hate it when you refer to them as children.
83,42,17,That reminds me. We're out of bananas.
34,5,0,You promised me life would be MORE fun than that.
42,17,0,Perhaps they'll be more fun if we get a barrel.
44,7,3,Thought we were watching twelve monkeys tonight?
33,5,0,These are the eleven monkeys who were jumping on the bed but didn't bump their heads.
34,4,0,I thought they would be the answer to the "empty nest syndrome"
28,1,0,I'm tired of your monkey business--you need to grow up.
34,4,3,Go back in there and start all over. I found a typo in Henry V.
36,7,0,What's the matter? Don't like this stay-at-home ecotourism?
33,3,1,Is your family leaving soon? They've been here more than three days.
36,4,1,"What should I tell the zoo the next time they call"?
52,23,4,I miss cable.
46,7,3,You can't say that we were not warned about opening that barrel.
29,3,0,You shouldn't have sent the Sea Monkeys to finishing school...
30,2,0,I think it's time we talk about the monkies in the room.
64,16,10,pretty sure your profile read money manager

44,15,2,More fun than this?
36,1,2,Isn't This What You Meant When You Asked About "Monkeying Around?"
60,13,11,Prepare for a monkey sea of monkey doo.
49,14,2,Did you leave the barrel open again?
58,8,6,I really thought a barrel of monkeys would be more fun.
36,3,1,I think they are interested in your head size.
44,6,4,Was I right? Was our date more fun than a barrel of monkeys?
36,13,1,You invite one and they bring the whole family.
37,6,1,Are you sure you weren't followed?
36,5,1,Well they were fun in the barrel.
45,14,2,We shouldn't have left the bananas out.
73,36,11,Did the instructions say how to get them back in the barrel?
41,2,3,You have to pronounce it as "minkies." It's funnier.
48,20,2,At least the Joneses don't come by anymore.
31,5,0,We need to find a bunch of old typewriters.
55,20,4,I warned you about using that ancestry website.
38,6,1,Another 89 monkeys and some typewriters and we'll have it made.
50,5,5,We should have never opened that barrel.
44,9,1,I stopped horsing around.
82,22,2,This is not what I meant when I said I wanted to do some monkey business.
39,7,1,You're sure you ordered Sea Monkeys?
35,5,1,I could have sworn the barrel said Malbec.
33,4,0,I didn't realize the real estate agent was telling the truth when she said there was a lot of monkeying around in this neighborhood.
36,7,0,Are you sure that there were no instructions in that barrel?
53,13,5,I thought we originally ordered two males.
46,12,2,A barrel of monkeys IS funny. But two barrels sucks!
37,7,1,This monkey business is getting out of hand.
43,2,0,I promised I'd be happy if they weren't jumping on the bed.
52,9,6,Apparently it's only fun with the barrel.
36,5,1,... Damn you match.com ... damn you match.com ... damn you match.com ...
48,12,4,Fine. YOU try to get them back in the barrel.
33,3,0,Florence. These are not our children and I am tired of bannanas for supper.
54,16,6,Perhaps this was a bad idea.
36,9,0,It's an app. It's called Delivery Chimp.
37,5,1,I didn't realize you had so many monkeys on your back.
30,2,0,I thought the ad said 'prime' location...
33,2,0,Is this a result of your monkey business?
34,7,1,Now we know it takes 11
51,18,4,When does our subscription run out?
32,2,0,But I feel so much more alive when I use the body spray.
34,3,0,Don't fret. Their flea collars are brand new.
46,10,4,Yes I’m disappointed; you know I wanted an even dozen.
55,13,7,I've never seen Coco like any of my dates before.
36,2,2,Are you accusing me of monkey business?
42,6,2,I can't remember the last time I had a banana on my cereal.
30,1,0,"I told you if you didn't get ECHO out of the BEDROOM this would happen!
41,6,2,They were all out of the Golden Retriever Family Pack.
37,5,1,How would you like to live in a cage?
36,5,1,Does make a lot more things seem fun by comparison.
34,4,0,Just smile and say Cheeta.
39,10,1,You're uncle to all of them?
33,2,1,I intend to test the 100th monkey effect.
62,21,7,This place looks more like Capitol Hill every day!
63,26,8,Think we should unsubscribe from Amazon primate?
46,8,3,Tonight is barrel o' monkeys. Saturday is the Levinsons.
39,4,2,I'm not worrying until they are on my back.
45,14,3,You said we should try new things.
29,3,0,On the other hand 11 is our lucky number.
34,5,0,Now they're playing in our barrel.
44,8,3,Probably shouldn't have picked up the second barrel.
34,3,1,Monkey on your back? What was your first clue?
40,6,2,I'm afraid Airbnb-ing our apartment to the local zoo was a bad idea.
53,17,6,Do you get it now? This is America under Trump.
61,30,6,I was tired of all the cat hair.
48,14,3,Didn't you always say you wished you had a prime mate?
120,58,36,You knew I was an organ grinder when you married me.
40,7,3,Remember your last words Margaret? "We will get rid of these in a week." "Everybody wants a monkey!"
44,10,3,No! I'm not in the mood to monkey around.
51,23,3,Aren't there supposed to be twelve per barrel?
34,9,0,I thought they would cure your empty nest syndrome.
43,9,2,They are taking a break from Shakespeare.
51,13,5,Well you're not always a barrel of laughs.
54,21,4,Well at least they're not on my back any more.
31,2,0,The barrel must've broke? Is that supposed to be funny?
38,5,2,When did you say Tarzan and Jane were coming back??
51,15,3,I think you miscalculated on the number of monkeys to screw in that light bulb
51,7,3,We should go buy a bunch of typewriters. If we give them enough time one of them is sure to write "Hamlet - The Sequel."
38,4,0,It's interesting how things turned out.
73,22,13,I've been thinking about getting another Monkey.
31,4,0,So you admit it: living with me isn't more fun than a barrel full of monkeys.
77,43,13,You never like my friends.
37,6,1,A barrel full would be more fun than what we have now.
34,5,1,I thought it was time you knew what I have been keeping in that barrel in the garage!
29,5,0,Don't worry. They're more afraid of you than you are of them.
40,7,2,We probably should have kept the barrel.
43,7,3,Interesting wish.
40,5,1,The wedding's over. It's time for the relatives to go home.
85,41,17,They call me the Chimp Whisperer.
51,20,3,Another order from Amazon...?
42,12,1,...and you wanted a Roomba.
36,6,1,I'm waiting for the 12th monkey.
30,3,0,Maybe we shouldn't have recycled that barrel.
33,4,0,Let's check to see if monkey infestation is covered on our home owners policy
55,16,4,OK. I'll put them back in the barrel.
40,9,1,is there a better time for me to call on you...?
42,8,2,Can I interest you in a Daiquiri?
48,18,2,Enough fun. Put them back in the barrel.
42,6,2,I'm sorry. I could only afford half a barrel.
33,3,0,And this is why i always said no when you asked about wanting to try some monkey business.
45,17,2,Didn't we say eight o'clock bedtime?
43,7,2,It will be more fun when the barrel ships.
42,3,3,I said I wanted a lot of money... not monkeys!
38,9,1,I thought they were your relatives.
55,21,4,Why must you always bring your work home with you???
42,6,1,I've had it with your monkey business.
32,4,2,I thought your dating profile said money's all over the house.
59,28,6,I'm kind of glad we didn't take the whole dozen.
51,14,3,Wait til you see what we're paying for bananas.
56,17,6,Wanna make it an even dozen?
36,4,1,I told you not to let them watch "Game of Thrones."
36,6,0,I hear you're a fan of 12 Monkeys.
45,15,0,They're not quite as much fun as advertised
57,19,7,Is there a monkey on my back?
50,20,2,So now you can tell your friends we're an interesting couple.
848,810,602,You ordered from the wrong Amazon.
39,10,1,Better in the barrel?
34,4,0,I thought you'd be pleased that I finally scored a buy 10 get 1 free deal.
55,21,2,I think our hosts are hinting it's time to go.
38,8,1,But you promised me a dozen!
42,12,1,I asked you if you were interested in a little monkey business?
73,31,9,You know they were much more fun in the barrel
33,3,0,Maybe he thinks you need a different hairdo
36,1,0,Sir. Solar panels were a bad idea.
52,12,6,Are you sure you want children?
41,8,3,When did you start paying your employees peanuts?
44,5,4,Jay-Jay is blind. But he'll always remember you by the way you feel.
33,4,0,The package said "Sea Monkeys"
57,17,5,They typed all of Shakespeare. Now what?
35,4,0,I said I needed 11 'more keys'
45,12,3,And you said couples therapy would open a can of worms.
46,9,3,At least they're not cats...
41,12,1,And the barrel is where?
53,19,6,They think I'm their uncle.
51,3,1,You should have never bought Bobby those sea monkeys for his birthday.
31,4,0,How did Gordon serve the monkey brains on tonight's "Hell's Kitchen" show?
34,3,1,I told you to look up the word "fecund."
36,7,0,Just because you're their uncle doesn't mean we have to babysit them every weekend.
39,5,2,I told you never to touch my barrel
40,9,2,They're taking a break from typing the complete works of Shakespeare.
39,7,1,You'll sing a different tune when the subsidy checks start rolling in.
25,2,0,This is your idea of monkeying around? I was hoping for something a little less furry.
51,7,6,At least there isn't an elephant in the room.
49,15,3,This isn't my idea of swinging.
43,3,0,I thought you said that living in a barrel would be FUN!
35,4,1,I had rather be up to my a_ _ in alligators !!
40,5,2,You /did/ say it would be nice to have some help around the house.
38,7,1,Our alternative to the presumptive nominee is ready.
39,8,1,No more trips to Bargain Barrel....ok?
48,12,4,I thought the primaries were over.
31,1,1,There's gotta be an aping hole in this house somewhere.
30,4,0,Monkey saw...monkey did.
42,10,2,You should expect a few challenges when you buy a new house.
35,3,1,This is your idea of having fun!
67,5,0,YOU SAID IT WOULD BE MORE FUN THAN A BARREL OF MONKYS !

54,9,7,I've had just about enough of your monkey business.
44,9,3,I thought there were 12 monkeys in a barrel.
42,10,2,I told you to close the window when your baking banana bread
36,4,0,Isn't experiencing the swinging lifestyle a great idea for our marriage?
56,14,9,And you'll be a monkeys' aunt.
37,4,2,No! I don't want to 'monkey around' tonight."
37,6,1,So your distant relatives leave tomorrow?
56,20,5,Why are you complaining? You're the alpha.
82,22,4,The label on the barrel clearly said "do not open indoors!"
32,1,1,Stop comparing us to Booth's people.
44,13,1,Should I open another barrel?
41,6,2,The kids playing Jumanji or did you open the barrel?
41,13,2,They were on sale.
36,3,1,If you don't like them you can exchange them
50,18,4,Have you traced your family tree back far enough now?
39,8,1,How long before our free subscription runs out?
32,3,0,They arrived in an old wine barrel.
41,8,2,Can we get a dog?
35,5,1,It's ok; they're only virtual monkeys.
36,4,0,What? I thought I would move from the derivatives market to the monkey business.
40,12,0,They seem to have adjusted to our natural surroundings!
53,20,4,I dunno. I can think of several things more fun than this.
32,3,0,Quit monkeying around
58,20,7,What's more fun than this?
37,4,1,'Let's just hang out at home today.''
42,15,0,My profile clearly states I like animals.
39,8,1,Are you sure that's the whole barrel?
108,55,30,Looks like I ordered from the wrong Amazon.
56,14,0,I trust that's the last time you'll refer to me as Curious George?
41,8,1,What happened to the typewriters?
31,0,0,So is it more fun with or without the barrel.
34,6,0,I think they're trying to tell us we're not too old to monkey around.
67,21,11,Tell me you didn't recycle the barrel.
63,14,0,I thought you liked monkey business
38,9,1,But I thought you liked it when I said that tonight there would definitely be some monkey business.
50,13,5,Fine! We can discuss getting cable again.
47,10,5,Still not enough fun for you?
56,20,7,Fine. Buy the typewriters.
33,5,1,They weren't doing this at the zoo.
104,60,27,Let me know if they bother you.
40,10,3,I told you to buy the small barrel. But no...
53,18,5,I needed the barrel for the wine I'm making.
47,14,3,How do we get them back in the barrel?

36,9,0,This marriage is driving me bananas.
40,11,1,This really isn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.

41,6,2,It's better than the in-laws.
38,8,1,They want pole lamps.
32,3,0,It's better than my seventh-grade classroom.
48,19,5,Now isn't this more fun than a barrel of children?

32,4,0,Not my circus not my... WAIT... they are my monkeys!
36,5,0,I told you that global warming was just around the corner

36,4,1,I forgot to shop for bananas
32,3,0,I said I was OPPOSED to the idea....
28,1,0,You're bananas.
31,1,1,I thought you said that you wanted more monkeys around.

34,7,0,I said "bring in the CLOWNS."
44,7,5,I told you we should keep the barrel.

38,8,1,Why did you let them out of the barrel?

60,19,4,I thought we were adopting them over there.
36,3,1,Getting them involved in politics was not a very good idea.

42,11,3,They were more fun when we kept them in a barrel.
34,4,0,Will you stop monkeying around!?!
74,44,11,So you're sure nothing else is bothering you?
34,4,0,Next

76,12,3,Touch my monkeys.
52,11,6,We never should have shopped for a monkey at Costco's.
55,21,5,I’d like to propose an amendment to our ‘no cats’ agreement.

38,9,0,You can swing with the best of them!
109,53,18,At least the elephant's out of the room?
37,4,2,So this is what WWF sends you when you donate?

33,5,0,I was thinking of listing our home on "Air B&B" when we go visit your sister
29,1,0,Our twelfth little 'guy' fell off the bed and hurt his head.
38,3,1,Not that much fun. Can you put them back in the barrel?
36,6,1,Isn't it bedtime for Bonzo?
38,9,0,you forgot to put the lid on the barrel again
40,13,0,I thought we agreed not bring work home anymore.
35,3,0,Ge the laptop; I smell a masterpiece!
64,20,11,We bought it with a sub-primate mortgage.
38,13,0,Why go out when we could have just as much fun here?

36,3,0,Are you still determined to watch the conventions?
45,14,2,I met them at a political focus group.
37,6,1,The barrel has termites.
47,15,4,I think you're taking this paleo lifestyle a little too far.
40,12,1,I liked the empty nest better.
106,53,29,Maybe AirBnB was a mistake.
86,48,16,Do the other zookeepers bring their work home?
24,2,1,These ARE our monkeys.
33,6,0,At least we don't have to pay for college.
50,14,4,Don't look at me. You're the one who said they had to stop jumping on the bed.
34,2,1,This is more fun thatn a barrel full of wine.
46,13,3,They're really more fun when they're still in the barrel.
57,17,6,Don't even think about what's going on in the bedroom.
41,3,3,I'm not a monkey wench.
45,6,4,How did we end up in the room where the top three captions are selected?
35,7,1,Monkeys see and monkeys do!
46,12,3,Must we do this family portrait thing every Christmas...?
64,26,6,It turns out you can have too many monkeys.

25,1,0,The penguin says it's just a little ice cream. Get it?
32,2,0,They were all out of the ones with the straight tales.
34,5,0,I guess we should stop monkeying around...
36,9,0,I told you your breath smells like bananas.
52,6,3,Don't you think that a baby would be less trouble?
78,17,11,You promised we would go see my mother when monkeys flew out of my butt.
51,14,4,You are more fun.
107,59,22,Crazy that I've managed to stay single all these years.
65,31,8,That one is named George. He's just being curious.
36,8,2,But you said you miss the debates.
54,18,6,I told you not to buy bananas at Costco!
43,6,4,I always hated the monkey in the middle.
49,7,6,They were a highly rated Home Cleaning Business on Angie's List.

30,1,0,I thought you would like them. they act just like you sometimes
116,69,31,Life was easier when you were a cat person.
39,6,1,Maybe now you'll appreciate me more.
38,6,2,I told you we needed a barrel for it to be fun!
60,12,9,Good thing we only got the small barrel.
85,39,18,I thought the bank offered us the prime rate but I must have misheard.
40,7,3,The Dutch find it very relaxing
54,21,5,They're a lot more fun inside the barrel.
28,4,0,Mother warned me not to marry a Greystoke.
35,1,1,I'm getting really tired of Obama and his trips.
32,3,0,Your sister said a barrel of monkeys is the new homeopathic remedy for empty nest syndrome.
39,3,0,But we're rebooting 'Hamlet.'
57,28,4,So this is what you meant when you invited me over to monkey around?
57,14,7,You never said you were allergic.
38,11,0,Whose uncle?
93,17,4,I thought that was just rabbits.
59,17,9,Not exactly what I had in mind when you asked to bring home some swingers.
40,5,2,All I'm saying is maybe if they saw and heard a little more evil they might finally getting around to typing that novel you keep talking about.
35,6,0,I don't care if their barrel is being gentrified. They can't stay here!
37,6,1,And YOU argued that if we get a cat it might have kittens.
59,27,6,What? I didn't say anything to you when your friends were over.
36,1,2,It’s a last resort to find your car keys.
37,2,2,What kind of key opens a banana?
39,6,2,I guess they had you over a barrel.
38,8,1,I think I'll get the barrel.
64,28,7,It's called the Jane Goodall Experience. I found it on Craigslist.
30,2,0,That's the problem: one moves in and then they bring their whole family over.
62,20,8,A barrel of wine would have been more fun.
40,8,3,Would you like to monkey around?
57,27,4,This is not what I meant by swinging.
49,11,6,we must ask the cleaning service to send a different crew next time.
36,4,1,Don't be upset mom. They like you.
29,1,1,Is this mind meld helping you envision peace in our home?
34,5,0,I warned you babysitting for my distant cousin can sometimes get hairy.
41,12,1,Now will you reconsider having children
40,7,1,I told you your new haircut looks like a coconut.
34,2,1,Your friend said you were a lot of fun but she also said you had a barrel.
45,8,0,No Dear...I think it's all in your head... I don't see any monkeys.
36,4,2,Not what I had in mind when you said you needed to bring some work home.
47,13,4,Still think a trained monkey could do my job?
40,6,3,You're the one who said no more monkeys jumping on the bed.
37,8,1,We should've let them jump on the bed.
33,5,1,At least they're not bonobos.
34,5,0,This place isn't big enough for the thirteen of us.
53,22,3,Just be nice. We never get invited to Jane Goodall's parties.
44,6,2,The raffle was for a good cause. First prize was two killer whales.
35,6,1,You wanted me to get those monkeys off my back !
47,6,0,I just wish that you were still more fun than a roomful of monkeys.
43,7,3,They lied. A barrel full of monkeys isn't more fun.
51,23,3,Ready to rethink my request for a dog?
46,15,2,This wouldn't be a problem if you had picked up the typewriters.
51,18,3,Do we still have that old typewriter?
34,3,1,I say put them back in the barrel.
31,3,0,I tried to tell you they would multiply
40,5,2,Oh please: they are SO more fun outside of the barrel
103,13,6,I read somewhere they're cheaper by the dozen.
34,2,0,The children are back from college.
33,4,1,I hate when they think they're funny!
42,8,3,You play with them--they're from your side.
59,14,8,I guess it just isn't that much fun without the barrel.
41,9,1,No. You're the one that insisted we don't need the barrel.
37,3,2,I guess our kids really are monkeys.
56,8,9,It will be worth it come tax time.
37,7,0,Looks like monkey business to me no matter what you say.
161,94,60,we might have ordered from the wrong amazon
35,6,0,The price did seem a little high for sea monkeys.
47,6,1,You're sending mixed messages. You said no monkeying around.
38,6,1,And how many monkeys came in the barrel?
37,8,0,You proved your point. Where's the barrel?
30,3,0,I thought a barrel had a dozen
49,12,4,Don't worry hone. You'll always be my Prime-mate.
48,11,5,We should have got just two gay monkies.
33,4,0,I don't find your nephews to be a barrel of fun.
32,0,1,I can cancel the order if you like. Robot Guru promised a variety of shapes.
38,4,1,Oh come on. The ASPCA won't let me keep them in a barrel but they are still fun.
35,3,1,What do you mean? He assured me this business was legit.
48,19,2,They're still less annoying than reality TV.
42,5,3,I told you not to touch the barrel. This happens every time George!
60,15,9,Ninety-seven percent DNA overlap isn't enough.
29,0,0,Hazel your pets are getting totally out of hand!
46,12,2,I have no problem with "Monkey see; Monkey do." My problem is "I see Monkey doo-doo."
30,3,0,You have to get monkeys to make money.
81,54,15,The "monkey see" part is not what I'm worried about.
47,14,4,We shouldn't have fed them.
37,3,2,Did you leave the lid off my barrel of monkeys?
31,2,0,It's your fault that they are going bananas!
35,7,0,This place is a real zoo! You know that?!
59,22,7,I think you used the wrong Amazon account.
36,3,2,I'm sorry dear but you just have to accept that Trump will win the Monkey vote. After all Trump Banannas was one of his success stories!
40,12,1,Shouldn't we discuss the elephant in the room?
60,22,7,I just think it's our responsibility to tell them they're adopted.
80,32,17,So can you believe it's been almost a year since I signed up for the Monkey-of-the-Month Club?
36,6,2,I'll release the monkeys when you tell me what's wrong.
33,5,0,Do you STILL want to go to the Monkey Bar?
69,26,8,It is so nice when your family visits.
38,6,1,When will you ever admit your monkey-rescue plan was a major mistake?
55,16,5,I thought it was your turn to lock the barrel .
31,3,0,Twelve!!!
43,10,3,What's next...locusts?
42,12,1,And I thought bed bugs were bad.
48,13,3,At least they are not calling you the cat lady.
45,6,5,Finally...no more monkeys jumping on the bed!
49,15,3,They were cheaper by the dozen.
40,9,1,Told you so. Aren't I more fun than the barrel of monkeys?
34,5,0,There's an Amazon.com joke in this somewhere.
53,17,6,Can you put bananas on the list?
42,12,1,Are you sure you don't see any monkeys in the room?
45,16,2,Maybe playing Jumanji wasn't such a good idea.
32,2,0,There's enough Monkey Business here as it is and I also don't need you hanging around ...
70,32,16,I'm done with airbnb.
34,7,1,Not so fun without the barrel as it turns out.
39,4,2,Trump outlasted them all.
32,5,1,Let's get some zebras for the pool room.
36,7,0,Your mother was right-we do live in a monkey house.
32,3,0,Monkey business makes us the threatened species.
55,9,0,I know they are annoying but they certainly breed well.
39,6,2,Make up your mind woman! Now it's too much monkey business?
36,5,1,Couldn't you just buy their T-shirts like any other fan?
50,10,4,They said they were from your side of the family...
40,8,1,Just think: one more and we'll have enough for a Barrel of Monkeys. Imagine the fun we'll have then ...
35,7,0,At least the mice are gone
36,2,1,this babysitting for your sister has gone too far.
39,7,1,I take it that your family doesn't believe in creationism then.
33,4,0,Does it include free returns?
68,31,9,Survey Monkey has taken it up a notch.
56,19,5,Hand me my monkey wrench.
33,0,1,I think you're chimply marvelous.

36,3,1,One more and we have an Army
79,6,3,My work is my life.
33,4,0,Your face transplant is starting to look more natural.
45,13,3,Why all the long faces?
62,20,8,My profile did mention I was a swinger.
41,4,2,You have GOT to stop this monkey business!
36,3,0,Sometimes I wish my you-know-what was prehensile.
32,2,0,The lady at the store said they would stay in their barrel.
38,6,1,How are you going to get them back in the barrel?
40,7,2,I mean... at least you're getting a head rub.
31,3,0,Back in the barrel?
50,22,2,Looks like you'll be a monkey's aunt.
39,7,1,Did you get a full barrel?
34,1,0,I’m tired of dogs and I thought you could use the company.
31,2,1,I know you said you wanted to see 12 monkeys but 11 was all I could get on such short notice.
37,7,1,Perhaps a barrelful was too many.
37,6,1,I told you mike was a female.
33,3,0,And we couldn't just buy tickets to Shakespeare why?'
43,8,4,It was a typo: Seeking Groommates
34,5,0,I told you something bad would come from you parading around in that banana suit at night. And now here we are......like a moth to the flame.
58,18,9,Family reunions are a painful reminder that I married beneath me.
48,9,4,"I think we should just hang around today".
36,9,0,This is your idea of monkeying around?
31,2,0,But wan't it you who said simian day care would be easier?
46,8,4,Your profile said "No monkey business".
44,11,2,Well good for Jane Goodall. Why doesn't she come over and clean up this mess!
31,2,0,He wants you to smile--maybe we are on Candid Camera?

39,8,2,The typewriter repairman said he'll be here between 10 and 2.
55,6,1,I thought the empty nest syndrome was going to be totally different...
36,3,1,It's the latest back-to-nature therapy for Attention Deficit Disorder...
41,10,1,Maybe we should just let them jump on the bed.
49,10,5,How many are supposed to come in a barrel?
39,7,1,Maybe we should hold off on opening the crate.
33,6,0,Did you let the cat out?
44,6,4,Oldhay eryvay .tillsay--Iway alledcay hetay oozay.

37,7,1,I don't think this is fun at all!
34,5,1,How's life in the city?

35,3,2,Just got a great idea for a children's toy!
41,5,1,"A vacation together without the kids might be an idea".
46,14,3,Be patient. Eventually they're going to type the complete works of William Shakespeare.
40,5,2,Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine that our house isn't overrun by monkeys.
32,4,0,I had expected more from the VR documentary channel.
39,5,2,Here's that safari I promised you.

58,17,8,The barrel was extra.
30,1,0,I think this stay at home monkey business of web designing is not working out.
37,4,1,Do you suppose Darwin was only joking?
374,281,216,Then maybe you should just tell me what you want for your birthday instead of saying you don't care.
35,7,0,Took a year to break them of tossing feces. Just bear with it.
31,3,0,I think you took my barrel comment a bit too literally.
59,19,7,"So....what type of business did you say you were in?
65,25,11,Well at least they're not on our backs any more.
49,11,5,Planet of the Apes in 3D is a little too intense for me.
49,15,4,The bonus features on this new Planet Of The Apes BluRay might be a bit too much.
35,3,1,One of these monkeys must have some Shakespeare in him.
51,16,4,What else do we need besides bananas?
42,5,3,I told you not to vote for Trump.
36,6,0,I've been hanging with you for a long time Doris and I still can't figure out what you want.
37,8,1,I told you they were probably delivered in a barrel for a very good reason.
51,5,4,You just had to go to Costco and get a whole barrel.
44,12,3,Could it be that Nigerian email that we replied to?
43,6,3,Does this mean we can't have sex?
40,8,1,Anything would be more fun than this.
31,3,0,WHAT CAN I SAY "IT'S A MAN THING"
40,9,2,When the representatives from the Organ Grinders union show up you'll feel differently.
38,11,0,Which one's Shakespeare again?
42,10,2,See? I was right --- they're always more fun INSIDE the barrel.
30,1,0,The twelfth must still be in the barrel.
42,10,2,It' great to finally get that monkey off my back.

35,3,0,"You definitely said 'monks'".
37,7,0,And then you said more fun than a barrel of monkeys
53,17,5,They're distant relatives.
47,14,3,You said you wanted to know what my job is like.
31,2,0,I'm sure that I told the realtor "turn-key ready"
51,12,5,Can't you be pleasant? My family visits just once a year.
34,3,0,But any doofus can have a dog or cat.
34,4,1,But what can I say? They are relatives on both sides.
38,10,2,When I asked for the Complete Works of Shakespeare for my birthday this is not what I had in mind.
25,0,0,I told you marriage counseling is monkey business.
51,11,2,You should not have listed on LinkedIn that you worked for the Chiquita company.
55,22,5,Notice what?
40,8,1,You just had to get rid of that barrel.
48,11,4,I guess this makes you a monkey's aunt.
60,19,9,It's still less stressful than your mother visiting
45,19,2,What did you think I meant by monkey business?
34,2,2,I think Bruce Willis kept the other one.
31,1,0,does this mean there will be two for dinner sir?
39,7,1,I'm confused...wasn't the nursery rhyme about _ten_ little monkeys?
66,27,10,This isn't as much fun as I thought it would be.
58,13,9,I guess little Georgie wasn't curious about birth control.
33,0,1,I thought I ordered the traditional trio but they sent me modern evils instead.
61,19,9,Let's agree to stop ordering from Amazon.
39,9,0,Feel like catching a movie?
39,10,1,It was more fun with the barrel.
49,12,5,May I remind you that you insisted on a natural solution to our bed bug problem?

46,11,4,I was wrong. You are more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
75,22,15,They’ll be staying for three weeks - just like your mother.
45,12,2,This is the last straw! I am cancelling QVC first thing in the morning.
83,40,14,I'm not sure the realtor did a full disclosure
37,6,2,I see your family is in town.
42,7,2,We're out of bananas again!

44,12,2,What fertility drug did you take?
37,6,1,I meant 12 Monkeys THE MOVIE. But I appreciate it.
53,23,4,What did you think I meant when I suggested we monkey around
32,5,0,I told you we should have kept the barrel they came in. We'd be having fun now.
35,3,1,We accountants prefer to evaluate against an objective standard of fun
36,6,0,You insisted I had to get rid of the cats!
38,7,1,They finished typing the complete works of Shakespeare; now they have the rest of eternity to just hang out.
51,17,6,Not as much fun as they said it would be. Maybe we got a bad barrel.
52,23,4,But your profile said that you like pets.
36,6,0,They're here to attend to your every need.
44,9,3,I thought I noticed more hair in the shower drain recently.
58,21,7,Is now a bad time to tell you that we are out of bananas?
49,7,5,This is why Trump wanted to build a fence around Africa.
71,41,10,It's actually not as much fun as I thought.
46,11,3,I'm pretty sure they won't shed.
33,3,0,You just said you wanted a barrel of monkeys - you didn’t say it was a child's toy
41,8,3,I really think it was more fun when they were still in the barrel.
68,32,16,I told you not to go on eBay when you're drunk.
35,2,1,Get the typewriter out of the closet and we'll have a great play in no time.
45,16,1,Maybe I should return the yellow cowboy hat.
40,6,1,Don't you think this is so much more fun than being empty nesters?
32,4,0,Do you think they'll pass the Board?
39,8,1,What happened to the cats? What happened to the cats?
39,4,2,Do you think our children have ADD?
37,9,0,I told you I run a Monkey Business!
37,6,1,Change the channel.
44,5,1,You're right - they were a lot more fun when they were still in the barrel.
39,8,2,I forgot to pick up the bananas.
44,16,1,I threw out the barrel.
43,5,1,You said you have a dozen monkeys at home to attend to. I won't sit here and ignore the fact that I've been given the wrong impression!
51,9,6,I think we should we have stopped trying after the 10th
29,2,0,'Miss my bananas.''
32,1,0,Well at least it isn't Shark Week on the National Geographic channel yet...
92,34,20,At least we got rid of the Elephant in the room
46,14,3,We should have kept the barrel.
46,17,6,worst date ever
29,0,0,Yet another rousing game of Barrel of Monkeys
61,15,4,Surprise!
34,2,1,Maybe they should see you do less climbing on the furniture and swinging from the fixtures.
52,20,2,My relatives? I thought they were your relatives.
48,11,4,Life was easier when we had cats.
43,18,2,I hope you saved the receipt. And the barrel.
31,2,0,Life is just a barrel of monkeys.
27,3,0,But you must concede self-awareness.
45,10,2,And you thought I was a nit pick.
35,3,1,My DNA test says I'm three percent Neanderthal.
41,8,1,Tell him you just want to hang out.
33,3,1,You shouldn't let them touch you.
32,3,0,These are your monkeys; this is your circus.
42,6,2,It's time to call a professional.
66,20,10,Still glad we went with Airbnb instead of my sister's?
34,3,0,Monkeying around?
39,7,1,I let them out of the barrel but we still aren't having fun.
55,16,6,When I said 'rent 12 Monkeys ...'
65,29,9,We need a second bathroom.
53,20,4,They're as much your family as mine. Why don't you tell them to leave.
35,2,1,Can we PLEASE watch anything other than "Bedtime for Bonzo?"
72,25,15,I thought the will said he left you all his monies.
49,13,5,what else did you buy at the dollar store?
51,18,6,What's the fun in keeping them all in the barrel?
53,20,4,Now we just need some typewriters.
55,16,7,The first barrel was more fun.
36,8,0,Let's just give this a few more days.
41,12,1,They get this from your side of the family.
31,3,0,Why do you want to gout for dinner and a movie? There is plenty of entertainment here!
34,3,1,I thought 11 Monkeys was the prequel to 12 Monkeys.
62,23,9,We started with TWO little monkeys jumping on the bed ... I'm guessing those TWO little monkeys were doing more than just jumping on that bed.
36,4,1,Now you know how *I* feel!
44,13,2,My Attenborough is plenty sexy. It's your Goodall that is spoiling the mood.
46,10,4,The lab closed today.
34,2,0,We must be in Iowa.
55,4,2,They can clean hard-to-see places
31,1,1,I told you a barrel of 'em wouldn't be that much fun.
38,9,1,You were the one who said our relationship needed more fun.
33,4,1,It's more than just monkey business.
64,17,11,Sure it's bad but it's not "flying" monkey bad.
33,5,0,You are too damn literal!
36,5,2,It just seems that the fun has gone from our marriage since you threw away the barrel.
45,10,3,Your profile said you are looking for intimacy and someone with strong grooming habits.
40,7,2,Boy those SurveryMonkey guys really do their research.
36,4,1,You told me not to open the can of worms.
51,17,5,I told you not to order from Amazon.
41,7,2,Whoever said life was a barrel of monkeys was an idiot.
37,7,1,I told you we shouldn't have opened that barrel!
30,0,2,We should have stayed in Kansas.
60,13,10,You told me to invite our closest relatives.

46,10,3,We could finish that game of Jumanji. Or we could just watch T.V.
62,5,0,You told me to clear out the barrel.
46,11,3,But the barrel was extra...
32,1,0,They know the monkey business we are engaged in pays our home mortgages.
44,10,3,I'm pretty sure I would have preferred the 800 pound gorilla.

31,2,0,' No more banana splits for you.''
63,24,8,I lost the barrel in the divorce.
30,1,0,This would be more fun if you hadn't thrown out the barrel.
49,15,3,Half a barrel might have been enough.
33,3,0,It's your turn to clean up the poop.
38,5,1,I got a great price on the barrel
57,14,7,I'll never make a bet with a zookeeper again.
28,0,0,I don't think I'm going to invite them to my graduation.
48,11,5,What monkeys?
41,10,0,One more and I can actually prove they're cheaper by the dozen.
54,9,6,Great — I finally get drawn into a New Yorker cartoon and it's with a bunch of monkeys.

45,9,3,I forgot to ask you if you've been vaccinated for hepatitis B recently.
50,15,4,We're going to need a bigger barrel.

59,13,7,I thought the broker said it was a 'prime-rate habitat'.
56,24,4,They're more fun when they're in the barrel.
43,10,2,This is why the monkey sitting business is wide open.
72,27,11,This is my first meeting of organ grinders annonymous
40,7,2,OK....no more jokes about your monkey business.
97,10,2,Should we talk about the elephant in the room; the 11 monkeys in the room?
36,5,0,But this version of Barrel of Monkeys had the best reviews.
44,13,2,We're out of bananas.
36,3,1,What did you think would be in a barrel of monkeys?
53,13,8,I will return them to the barrel as soon as you hand over the remote.
38,9,0,Darn it; I told you not to open that barrel!
38,4,0,Can't we get an even dozen?
37,6,1,#12 has gotten out again.
45,12,2,Hey - at least no more monkeys jumping on the bed.
30,5,0,I thought we had 12.

45,11,2,I rather prefer the elephant.
35,3,1,All of the monkeys ain't in the zoo.
53,21,5,But with 12 the barrel is free.
36,5,1,So when do they finish writing Hamlet?
31,2,1,Airbnb said the tree house would guarantee "local immersion."
35,3,1,Last night I told the kids to stop monkeying around and these protesters showed up this morning.
53,14,5,"Say goodbye to empty nest syndrome".
38,6,1,Nothing like this ever happens in one of MY family reunions.
49,6,4,So what are you going to do with the barrel?
35,5,0,With my arthritis acting up I just can't get them back into the barrel.
53,15,7,When do the typewriters arrive?

40,5,3,The last thing I need is another monkey on my back!
33,4,0,I thought you said no more monkeys jumping on the bed.
65,34,9,You can blame Congress for cutting my research funding.
81,45,16,Let the chimps fall where they may.
31,3,0,I can read your monkey mind.
41,3,3,You said you wanted to monkey around.
40,10,2,I suppose we should have gotten the goldfish.

33,6,0,I was afraid you were getting bored.
38,7,1,Are you seeing monkeys again?
52,17,6,I love music too. Can you guess my favorite band?
36,7,0,At least they're housebroken
58,25,5,Al least they're off my back
32,3,1,I thought you said one was female.
35,8,0,You said "Let's have pets instead of children".
34,6,0,What do you mean MY relatives?
42,10,2,C'mon. The video store didn't have "Twelve Monkeys" so I got the prequel.
45,11,3,I told you one was a male and one was female.
42,6,2,I liked them better when they were just jumping' on the bed.
69,25,9,I thought it was a beer keg.
42,1,0,A number of you have been slow so I’d appreciate someone knocking this out. Thanks.
37,9,0,They wouldn't let us adopt just one
50,12,5,Which is your favorite?
50,12,5,I'm starting to suspect I'm not the father.
33,5,0,Tell me again. You found a lamp? Three wishes?
35,4,0,What do you mean spanking?
37,2,2,I asked you for a nice little MINKIE for my birthday!
40,8,2,Just play along with the de-ticking... you might gain approval... maybe even acceptance into the troop.
41,3,3,I guess you could say I'm a player.
51,13,5,Nice floor lamp.
35,2,1,My ‘more fun’ list is approaching four digits.
50,11,1,But they're much better than having roaches.
49,13,5,They are not mine. They are my uncle's monkeys.
41,9,2,Do we have someone playing Jumanji in our house?
34,7,0,You call this fun; where's the barrel?
39,9,1,Shall we watch planet of the apes?
36,1,2,But I thought you liked basketball.
41,7,2,Just think how much we'll get done with an extra 22 opposable thumbs!
47,12,5,They're driving me bananas.
48,11,4,What--only you can have friends over from the lab?
43,3,1,I guess you will now agree with me that getting a barrel full of monkeys for fun was not such a good idea.
66,34,8,I thought you meant something a little more risqué when you suggested bringing home some swingers.
47,12,4,Good news! Today we should finally get that shipment of typewriters in.
30,4,0,this isn't the monkey survey i had in mind.
31,5,0,What's stopping you from having twelve?
40,10,0,This is not working. I'll put them back in the barrel.
36,4,1,I don't have time for this monkey business.
41,10,2,This is not what I was expecting when you suggested coming back to your place for a little monkey business.
32,2,0,I told you we should have kept those typewriters.
40,6,2,Oh. You wanted "Me" to be more fun.
77,43,16,When do you think we should tell them we aren't their biological parents.
28,3,0,What if we let them jump on the bed?
34,4,1,I told you after the first one to get your tubes tied.
35,5,1,Do you want to watch Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds?
68,33,10,I think it's time we put an end to this monkey business
38,7,2,Maybe we should give one away.
56,19,6,Maybe we should have asked what the prize was when we bought the raffle.
39,8,1,You only told them to stay off the bed.
62,26,7,Aren't you even a little bit curious?
59,20,7,The real fun is putting them back in the barrel.
44,12,1,I thought YOU invited them.
46,11,4,Shall I inform Ancestry.com that we're not amused?
54,19,5,And just what would this new business be called?
45,12,3,At what point do they take their cups to the sidewalk for us?
65,21,11,I don't complain about your relatives.
42,9,2,When are they going to start on the Shakespeare?
47,14,3,You tell them to leave. They're your family.
38,7,0,I thought a barrel full of monkeys would be fun.
30,1,0,Where do you think they saw this?
30,0,0,Hark. Hark. The Republicans are coming...
46,7,1,You wanna fool around?
41,1,1,Even their banana is in therapy. Why did you say yes to this?
37,6,1,I dunno. They're not as much fun as they said they would be.
42,10,1,I'm pretty sure they have 98% of just your DNA.
38,4,3,I know you said you wanted a dozen monkeys but this is all they had.
57,24,6,How long is your family visiting for?
38,6,1,There was a sale at Chimps Galore!
43,9,2,At least they don't need college degrees
31,3,0,Monkey see monkey do. I told you this was a bad idea.
40,10,1,Good thing Costco's having that 20% off sale on bananas.
34,5,0,Now do you favor monkey vasectomies?
39,7,1,These monkeys are literally driving me bananas.
40,6,1,I've told you about my work friends.
53,14,4,I believe you were the one who said Airbnb would be a barrel of monkeys
45,16,1,I miss the Gorilla.
38,6,1,The million typewriters I ordered should be here next week.
34,5,0,Where is Curious George when you need him?
38,6,1,If this continues... I'm moving to Canada
34,4,0,Please get the barrel out of the attic.
41,12,1,Maybe using that cut-rate sperm bank wasn't a good choice.
46,14,3,You said you wanted to be expertly groomed.
47,14,4,It was more fun when they were inside the barrel.
55,13,7,Can I interest you in a banana?
34,3,2,I want a typewriter!
50,17,4,You said you want to thank my team of stock pickers in person.
41,12,1,We really should have stopped with ten.
37,6,1,I thought YOU were going to pick up the bananas!
38,9,1,I hate it when the banana shipment is delayed!
30,2,0,It will be a great conversation starter for the dinner party.
61,12,1,It doesn't look like you're having more fun...
38,4,1,How was I to know our ARM would hit Prime +8?
37,5,1,There was supposed to be a barrel?
36,4,1,I never SAW or DID any of this!
53,10,6,I've had enough fun. Time to put them back into the barrel.
35,3,1,I can't see a downside here.
42,7,0,Guess it's our turn in the barrel
30,0,1,Oh! I thought you said you wanted to see more of my priMATE instincts not primal instincts." Or .... " you keep saying even a monkey can do it so lets find out!
55,0,0,You're the one who turned our garage into a greenhouse. We need the money.
45,8,5,I just don't like the way our relationship has evolved.
30,1,0,I thought there was just one per package
46,21,1,Are you sure they count as dependents?
51,23,3,Let's think about going back to cable.
63,17,8,Fine. You win. A dozen wild monkeys do not make better house guests than your mother.
40,8,1,We'll be lucky to get a 'Twilight' sequel out of this bunch...
117,70,32,You said they were both girls!
31,1,0,There are eleven monkeys here.
48,7,4,The owner said there was something weird about this apartment.
23,4,0,They were on sale; buy ten and you get the eleventh free.
32,3,0,I told you to pick the other barrel.
46,4,3,I'm starting to think that moving into a giant barrel was a bad idea.
35,3,0,Shakespeare? No! These guys are going after a timely New Yorker Poem.
36,5,1,Honey I think they're playing a game of monkey see monkey do.
37,5,1,Maybe we need the Barrel?
78,25,18,Checking for lice shows you've been accepted into the troop.
84,39,18,Tell me you still have the barrel.
41,7,1,They're a lot less fun if you open the barrel.
37,8,0,We did pay peanuts.
82,38,17,I thought the website said I would meet my prime mate
43,7,2,When are your relatives leaving?
43,5,4,Just a few more and we can finish the novel!
48,15,3,Stop worrying. I'm sure the coop board will understand that they are emotional support monkeys.
37,4,1,I thought you said that this wasn't your circus and these weren't your monkeys.
46,11,1,I told you we shouldn't start with a barrel.
67,28,10,Tell me a little more about your family's background.
53,15,6,Suddenly I have the sudden urge to throw poop.
65,29,7,They say they mean business.
34,2,0,They're really just copy cats.
44,4,1,The picture on the side of the barrel made this look like it would be a lot more fun.
48,13,2,Give them time...You weren't wild about my family at first at first either!
31,1,0,I too have created a monster sir... Linner is served.
56,11,8,Did you eat the last banana?
33,3,1,I can't believe this one has a 4-star rating on Aribnb.
36,5,1,Where's the freakin' barrel?
29,0,0,I didn't think all of your distant relatives were coming over for dinner...
40,5,3,How was I to know that you were some monkeys' aunt ?
33,6,0,I think it's time to call Jack Hanna.
36,1,2,You said you liked twelve monkeys.
57,14,8,How could you forget the bananas?
43,9,3,Monkeys? What monkeys?
43,9,2,All right you've proven your point... my parents are more annoying than a barrel full of monkeys! Now where did you hide the barrel?
63,24,9,So...what's new?
38,9,1,I did exactly what you said. I went straight up to my boss and demanded more monkeys.
58,11,9,They were a lot more fun when they were in the barrel.
88,14,2,They're my nephews.
38,4,2,The other option was having kids.
35,7,0,You always said you wouldn't mind a few extra hands around the house.
41,5,3,A few typewriters and soon we'll have Shakespeare.
45,7,5,Okay men. Back on your typewriters. We've got a deadline to meet.
35,7,0,You're the one that wouldn't talk about the elephant in the room
29,1,0,Henry why did you bring all the monkeys home from work.
49,7,5,Please stop referring to my family as animals.
47,19,1,We should make a Vine.
24,3,0,I've had enough of this monkey business. It's time for you to get a real job
42,7,3,I used the last banana this morning in my smoothie.
36,5,2,This would be more fun if we still had the barrel.
55,10,3,We really never know how the winner will be until after the election.
36,4,1,So you seriously think I left the top off the barrel?
49,14,4,Throw them out? They’re our closest relatives.
30,1,1,They were so much cuter at the zoo!
52,19,4,You're in denial about the monkey business going on around here.
78,33,16,At least there's no elephant in the room.
37,6,1,At least training monkeys costs less than putting kids through college.
38,4,2,Will you please just let them in the bedroom?
32,6,0,Did you forget to lock the door?
40,5,0,Sea Monkeys? What were you thinking?
33,4,0,"Did you bring the ladder"?
34,6,0,I told you not to buy that barrel.
50,13,4,Who said a barrel of these would be fun?
39,8,0,You'll just love the twelfth one.
35,6,0,Do you ever get the feeling someone's watching you?
43,10,2,Maybe a barrel full was too much
32,4,0,Our roommate situation has been an evolving discussion.
42,10,3,They're a lot less fun without the barrel.
32,3,0,I thought we agreed we don't need to spend extra on organic bananas.
45,6,4,I was just trying to help with the "empty nest" blues.
37,9,0,Why do you always buy in bulk?
46,12,3,What could be more fun than this?
39,9,1,Just be yourself. They're conducting a research study og human behavior.
31,6,0,They were having a fine time in the barrel.
78,0,1,Koko has a gift for making them seem lifelike.
38,6,1,1). I don't care if Jane Goodall is your cousin... NO more babysitting... 2). Want to monkey around?... 3). I'm your husband... I need to know who the father is...
54,9,7,They have nothing to do since they finally finished typing all of Shakespeare.
50,11,5,They were more fun before we let them out of the barrel.
50,17,6,They were a hell of a lot more fun in the barrel.
49,13,5,The barrel looks much smaller on Amazon.
40,2,2,How many times do I have to tell? Do not invite house guests who hang around the house all day!
40,9,1,The barrel is out for cleaning.
52,11,5,I'm starting to think they were more fun *with* the barrel.
59,15,9,I think we should be organ grinder donors.
44,12,3,The crate was labelled Amazon.
43,5,2,At least they're eating the bedbugs.
37,9,0,Budget cuts at the zoo.
56,19,6,It seems we have a few things to discuss before we get to the 800-pound gorilla in the room.
37,5,1,Enough with the monkey business.
41,9,2,I thought you wanted kids.
41,7,2,I knew I should have done a DNA on your family before I married you.
35,2,2,We should have used birth control
43,9,2,Do we need to ship them back to Amazon in the original barrel?
48,12,4,Now I know who stole my Viagra tablets.
47,10,4,At least we'll never have to worry about lice
36,3,1,You were the one who said that this would be better than having kids.
82,33,13,I didn't complain when your cousins came to visit.
133,71,40,Did I complain when you had your sisters for the weekend?
53,26,5,Did you leave the lid off the barrel again?
32,3,0,This is what you thought I meant by "spicing things up?"
45,10,3,The typewriters were back-ordered
33,5,0,What? you said that you wanted more excitement in your life.
31,3,0,Will you please just take your turn?
35,6,0,They are still better than bedbugs.
31,4,0,It's definitely your turn to get the barrel.
32,2,1,Nobody in my family has a prehensile tail; how about yours?
39,9,1,I'm still waiting for them to type the Encyclopedia Britianica
42,9,1,No I thought you let them out of the barrel
41,6,3,Don't complain. You knew about all my nieces and nephews when you married me.
64,13,0,The cats were easier to manage.
48,11,4,Is that a new perfume you're wearing?
32,1,1,"And you thought teenagers were tough"?
36,4,1,We should not have paid our cleaning staff peanuts
40,6,3,Says he needs you for an even dozen.
62,14,6,Maybe a barrel was too much...
273,180,157,I think I ordered from the wrong Amazon.
37,5,1,Now all the kids are going to call you the crazy monkey lady
63,22,7,Tell me again. You just added water and then what?
57,24,6,Sorry. It was just cheaper to get them by the barrel.
40,7,2,Isn't it time they stopped coming back here to do their laundry?
43,6,2,I hate to inform you that we're out of monkey chow.
59,26,8,Any word on how long the barrel will be in the shop?
41,10,2,I think I prefer them IN the barrel.
38,0,3,I think I prefer cockroaches.
33,3,0,But I thought you liked playing Barrel of Monkeys
