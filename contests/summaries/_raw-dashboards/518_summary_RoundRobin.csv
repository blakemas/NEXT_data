25,4,0,Beat it pal, you're going to have to think outside the sandbox.
25,3,1,Apparently his golden parachute was filled with sand.
27,1,0,It's his version of a desert survival simulator.
21,3,2,Talk about a first world problem.
28,1,0,Maybe he thinks it is human litter.
22,6,1,Would you prefer a rocking horse with no name?
24,2,1,Dad always said "It's a jungle out there"
23,3,3,Okay, it's settled. You'll tell him he's in the wrong cartoon.
17,7,3,Bob Green, reporting live from the Las Vegas Zen Garden competiton.
24,4,0,These mirages are getting elaborate.
26,1,1,This is much better than yoga mat.
25,1,0,Are you seeing this or is this one of those mirages I've heard about?
20,7,1,Jeff's training for global warming.
15,7,5,Well, at least he buried it.
23,6,0,Budget imposed desert training.
20,7,0,For those clients who cannot swim, we offer the Endless Desert option.
22,6,0,With global warming, we'll be seeing more of these rooftop gardens converted to rooftop Saharas.
21,6,2,He'll never find water thinking inside the box.
22,4,2,Honestly, I don't mind if dad thinks he's a cat. It's the clean-up I'm having a problem with.
25,3,1,Water? Are you kidding? We should build a wall.
27,1,0,Is he homeless or going to the beach?
23,4,0,Desert flashback.
26,1,0,He wanted to bum a skylight.
28,0,0,Betcha his favorite song is: "If I could tun back time"
23,1,3,We need an adult in the sandbox like a fish needs a bicycle.
25,1,0,sometimes its hard to help someone who's miserable that you just have to watch them from afar
22,4,1,Not sure just water is going to do it.
22,3,0,He says it helps him think.
18,6,5,Where are his parents?
25,3,0,A new Bansky-inspired art installation has just popped up today entitled, "Wilson, where are you?"
23,3,0,He says it's method acting prep on a budget
24,4,0,When are these darn poppies going to start to grow?
27,1,0,I think he said my caption might save him.
24,2,1,By a stroke of luck, he got here first.
23,4,2,He hasn't had a juice box in three days.
23,1,2,Don't mind him. He's insane.
19,5,2,Help--I've misplaced my dignity.
20,6,1,He claims to have tenure.
20,5,2,Mom was right, Brooklyn is a hipster playground.
21,5,0,I thought we were here to play

25,2,0,He says he's looking for the pool
20,4,2,Yes, but is it Art?

22,4,0,If you dig it, he will come.
21,5,2,First the cats were wrecking my fun and now this.
21,2,3,Ya think he'll get out if we put the cat in with him?
24,4,1,I call it 'Soul of Wall Street.'
21,5,2,I guess marketing's already thinking about the Californian campaign.
21,8,0,I think they call it 'failure to launch'
14,10,1,He's really got to start thinking out of the box!
23,4,1,I guess if You hang around the Cat Litter Box long enough, You are going to end up using it.
21,4,1,I guess that we shouldn't play with his smart phone in the sand box.
17,7,3,He should think outside the box.
29,0,0,Finally, I made it to Flah-ri-da!
21,4,2,He needs a small palm tree to make it more realistic.
22,6,0,Tell me again why we volunteered to keep the sandbox clean.
23,6,0,Ah, looking for the grain of truth.
20,6,1,This Living Art business is getting old.
23,5,1,Our other amenity is a resistance pool.
22,4,2,The struggle is real…
24,3,1,I think the cat's got his tongue.
23,1,2,I think he calls it Sun Salutation.
20,7,1,'Method acting' aside, it's our turn, Mister.
20,2,4,There but for the grace of God.
20,5,1,Why is he staring at the pool like it's not really there?
24,5,0,The name of the spin-off will be 'Sandbox Survivor.'
26,1,0,I think he misses his dog badly and hopes finding traces.
21,2,5,I'm not sure that this is what was meant by "make the refugees feel at home"
20,7,1,They built a wall around a Mexican instead.
27,1,0,These Foreign Legion boot camps are getting out of hand.
25,2,0,I know my cat's in here Somewhere!! MEOW MEOW!!!
21,4,1,I just can't get him to think outside the box.
23,2,3,Don't worry. Dad can only do 10 minutes in the endless desert.
26,3,0,I prefer a timeout rather than cleaning out the box.
20,8,1,Flat or sparkling?
22,5,2,I will sure be glad when his acting classes are over.
19,9,1,I guess you have to do more than think outside the box.
18,10,1,He is here until he learns to play well with others!
22,1,3,My Dad watched "Cast Away" on Netflix last night. Do you have a volleyball?
24,3,0,I told them putting a litter box out for public use was a bad idea!
22,4,1,He said it reminds him of parenting....
26,1,0,The children watch as Carl embraces his innermost felines...
22,6,0,Your dad's not just a helicopter parent; he's a Black Hawk down.
17,11,0,I say we vote him off the sandbox.
19,6,4,He needs to stink outside the box.
21,5,1,DSM-5. Early childhood sandbox deprivation.
21,4,2,So sad, this is where he discovers it's only a mirage

23,4,1,I think your pops needs a creative outlet. Community theater perhaps?
23,3,0,Daddy never outgrew "sand box".
26,3,0,Sorry Sally, we'll have to come back later. Mr Snider likes to reenact scenes from "Lawrence of Arabia" when he's had a bad day at work.
25,3,0,'You're the super: Fix the leak or get lost!' my mom said.
26,1,0,Don't worry, we just have to wait until he figures out we're part of his hallucination.
25,2,0,You know these "method" actors. He heard there were to have auditions for the "Laurence of Arabia" prequel.
25,2,0,I've heard about this new exercise craze. It's called the sandbox!
22,4,1,He mumbled something about losing his horse with no name.
18,4,2,Performance art pisses me off.
16,11,0,You don't understand performance art. Giving him water will only encourage him.
27,1,0,Buddy, this ain't no sand dune you're in downtown Minneapolis.
21,5,2,That's why I decided against contact lenses.
28,0,1,I lost my contacts
26,3,0,He thinks it's the 1869 one cent coin a told him I lost -- it's a penny.
28,1,0,And you can add that Mark needs more than a haircut. He'll soon have a butt-crack problem!
21,3,4,I'm inclined not to tell the search party.
23,4,2,The wavy line over his head means he smells bad.
23,2,2,It seems that coloring books are the gateway drug.
27,2,0,These pollsters are getting desperate.
22,6,0,Somehow I thought lycanthropy would be cooler.
25,2,0,He comes here to practice. He's going to a casting call for a role in a cartoon in The New Yorker.
25,2,0,I heard a rumor that years ago parents let their kids play in a sandbox by themselves.

14,9,5,Go get a couple of bottles of water, I sense profit.
23,4,0,Grownups need to play act rather than play.
23,3,1,OMG. It was only a quarter.
25,3,1,Dad's in training for the next 'Survivor'.
22,6,0,Ever since the new version of Lawrence of Arabia was announced, this place has been lousy with method actors.
28,1,0,Yeah, that's the guy, Neddy Merrill, the swimmer. I told him swimming home was a bad idea.
23,4,1,He should have turned left at Albuquerque.
23,6,0,I guess it's better then finding a cat in our sandbox.
16,7,5,His parents never picked him up.
23,4,1,You were right. No shoes allowed.
22,2,2,He's having another sand trap flashback.
23,4,1,His iPhone is not the only thing the cat buried in there.
25,2,1,He appeared in so many "New Yorker" cartoons, he has to do this every day at high noon.
19,7,2,These 'team-building' exercises just keep getting weirder.
17,7,3,He's auditioning for 'Survivor: Lower East Side'.
25,1,1,Think he'd mind if we jumped in?
26,0,1,After he has a few--He comes up here and puts his handprints in his Hollywood Boulevard Walk of game.
24,4,0,Pathetic! It's his way of getting out of shaving on Sunday morning.
21,5,2,This Navy Seal training is starting to cut into our playtime ...
23,4,1,And when he's done playing stranded on the desert island, he goes down to the trash room and plays post-apocalyptic scavenger.
26,0,0,Mom never should have filled in his endless pool.
25,3,1,He has it flown in from Anguilla, each grain triple carbon-filtered for purity and then infused with hints of fecal matter from the Hudson River.
23,5,0,He's going for the Guinness World Record for the longest Pub Crawl.

25,2,0,He dates 20 somethings.

24,2,0,This is Manhattan, kids. I pay $4,000 a month extra to play in this sandbox.
22,6,0,I'm starting to think we're just a part of his imagination.
28,0,0,He said we can't play until he's done acting out his 'urban food desert' fantasy.
27,2,0,Tony said when the last one awakens the giant within we can go to Chili's for happy hour
21,7,0,We really are getting the full New York experience at this Airbnb.
20,3,3,I think our Crossing the Border Simulation will be sure to speak to Trump supporters.
25,3,0,Should we point out the Korean Bodega on East 86th?
24,1,1,The poor guy sees a mirage.
22,3,0,There goes the neighborhood.
23,6,0,Funny, I don't feel like a mirage.
15,12,2,I hope he makes it.
24,5,0,Method actor.
23,6,0,Art is so strange these days.
21,5,1,Think he'll die soon?
24,1,1,You know, one man's trash is another man's treasure.
9,18,2,Of all the sandboxes, on all the roofs, in all the world, he crawls into mine.
28,0,0,Oh, so you think we should call it "Marriage"? Funny. I think we should call it "I'm Having an Affair with Your Brother."
22,3,2,It's part of a corporate retreat.
23,2,2,Don't look now but I think the man who says he'll do anything is about to draw a line in the sand.
26,0,0,I'm told they didn't give out participation trophies in his day.
15,5,8,I told you they were too big to have come from a cat.
20,4,1,He still believe the old legend: Where is sand there is camel".
26,2,0,He said it's called 'mooncrawling.'
17,6,3,I wish he'd start thinking outside the box.
18,6,4,He must think he's Lawrence of Suburbia
27,1,0,Hey dude, You're already out.
20,5,3,I don't know. I'd guess he's transitioning to house cat.
24,5,0,is that dad?
20,6,3,Are you seeing that too?
22,4,2,He says it's his sandbox and he'll crawl if he wants to.
22,6,0,This is why I'm not a fan of hot yoga.
28,0,0,Polictical regression is our last chance.
20,4,4,It's not so much that my Dad still thinks he's a cat, it's the cleanup that's killing me
21,4,0,I call dibbs on next.
24,2,0,Sorry kids, looking for my contacts.
25,2,0,"I call it, Alien in Sandbox".
18,7,1,How long has your dad been preparing for Survivor?
25,3,0,Dad’s still distraught about the $20,000 a month—without even a river or park view.
18,6,4,It all started with those adult coloring books.
27,2,0,He needs to learn how to play better in the sandbox
18,5,2,Great. It's the "Occupy Sandbox" movement.
27,2,0,He does look a bit like Sideshow Bob.
22,3,1,I swear that's where we buried Grandma.
27,1,0,I've never had a case where the defendant's name and the sentence are the same.

28,1,0,Rod Stewart looks like hell these days.
26,1,1,I even offered him some coconut water.
20,7,1,And I thought I had issues.
18,7,2,He hasn't been the same since we sold our beach house.
26,2,0,What's the Fata Morgana here - the man in the sand or New York?
24,4,0,When Daddy said he had to go scratch in the litter box, I thought he was just going to the bathroom.
25,3,0,He recently finished reading ‘Find Yourself in the Desert’, but he will do anything to avoid those annoying baggage fees.
19,7,1,Should we set up the sprinkler?
23,3,0,Mom said the Condo Board made him get rid of his camel.
25,3,0,So your Dad is showing us how he played in the sand where he grew up?
28,1,0,You can take a boy out of the beach, but you can’t take the beach out of a boy!
26,1,0,Just five mom minutes. Pleeeease.
17,7,2,It's true! Without his phone he really is lost!
23,4,1,That's what happens when you major in economics and environmental science.
19,9,0,I'm always confused. Performance or installation?
26,2,1,Good thing we removed the cat turds.
21,7,0,He's got to start thinking outside the box.
20,5,3,I hate the way climate change has affected recess.
26,0,0,We need to rethink our "castle "performance piece.
26,1,0,Are you certain you paid your taxes?
25,2,2,It's called mirage parenting.
24,0,3,Adding the smell of garbage really takes hyperrealist sculpture to the next level. The Whitney will beg for it.
26,2,0,Leave it to Daryl to take it next level.
27,1,0,That's my little Johnny. He convinced there's a treasure buried in there.
23,3,0,He's practicing for a desert island Reality TV show.
22,3,3,Though I'm usually against animal testing, I think we should have a cat test the kitty litter.
25,3,1,It used to be harder to die in the desert...
25,4,0,Please tell me that this is just another mirage.
21,6,1,Marco!
19,7,1,Whew! He's Lawrence of Arabia, today. Since he's not Felix the Cat, we won't need the shovel and pail, after all.
26,1,0,Those are not the kind of vultures the boss was talking about attracting.
24,5,0,I call 'first dibs' on those snappy shoes.
17,10,2,Thinking back, he may have ordered a small *dessert*.
26,0,0,He was known as the 'Frac Sand King' before business dried up.
18,7,1,The Guggenheim passed this up?
23,3,1,No, he can't leave the box. He's Republican - born without a future tense.
23,2,1,Clearly, we all need to practice our "out of the box" thinking skills.
26,2,0,It looks like he's been here awhile. I'm going to run down and grab him a Pellegrino.
26,2,0,But the co-op board rejected his application for an oasis mirage, though.
17,6,3,These new treadmills are just amazing.
23,3,1,I remember what it felt like to sit through Ishtar
28,1,0,It's only spring.

25,4,0,Stress can change a man.
18,6,1,Are you sure role reversal therapy with your cat really works?
27,2,0,Some people love what they do.
23,4,2,Think outside the box Jim!
21,3,4,He texted me at 3 a.m. saying that he'll be at the beach. He was drunk.
26,0,0,Come on, Herbie! Make it look like you,ve crawled many miles.
26,1,2,People gripe about gentrification but the sandboxes still suck.
22,3,2,We're trying ashtray aversion therapy to cure his smoking habit. If that doesn't work, we'll show him photos of Bette Davis at eighty.
25,2,1,He lost his virginity in that sandbox.
22,4,3,He just can't think outside the box.
23,4,0,It was only a friendship ring.
26,1,0,A grown-up's playground: A (concrete) Sand B(l)ox
23,4,0,Your dad sure is determined to find his inner child.
27,1,0,I'll search for my inner child. You guys think outside the box.
25,3,0,It's the dreaded sandboxitus.
22,7,0,His first choice was a lap pool.
19,7,2,The irony is that this is happening at The Mirage Hotel.
23,4,1,The artisanal sand make the experience so much more authentic.
21,8,0,They say he's been in time out for 20 years.
27,2,0,Left my charger at home.
19,8,2,We'll put the lemonade stand here.
22,3,2,In the next scene my dad reenacts Lawrence's first meeting with Prince Faisal.
26,3,0,Immersive acting turned out to be cheaper than the Maserati.
21,5,1,Ironic, perhaps, but wouldn’t a bucket and shovel compromise the integrity of his message?
26,3,0,So.. What's taking so long?
24,2,2,Once dad has finished looking for gold nuggets, we can have our turn
20,8,0,He claims to be the sole surviving investor in 'Ishtar.'
19,5,2,He just moved from Arizona here to New York City. He says he does this when he gets home sick.
23,0,3,Are those mom's ashes?
22,5,2,And this marks the end of the 1976 Baby Crawl Contest.
23,3,0,You can take the desert out of the desert, but you can't take the nomad out of the nomad.
23,3,2,Dude!? This is our beach.
18,9,1,Three consecutive days of mom's tuna casserole and dad thinks he's a cat.
24,2,3,Patience. He's getting in touch with his inner cat.
25,2,0,Some obsession with a film about a soccer ball and some ice skates.
25,2,1,He prefers to be called an "independent."
27,1,0,What a playdate. Is your dad a Pisces?
23,1,2,We are evidently all part of an elaborate mirage.
28,0,0,Should we tell him we're not mirage or go play Xbox instead?
23,5,0,Shouldn't we tell Mommy?
27,0,0,I guess he won't mind the stray cats use this sandbox as a kitty litter!
20,5,3,I wish he would learn to play outside the box.
22,5,2,The cat won't be happy about this.
22,5,0,Next week we'll mountain climb on the HVAC unit.
22,5,1,It's OK. My drunk uncle thinks he's a cat.
24,4,0,So this is what you meant when you said beach day...
24,1,1,He's showing off.
27,2,0,I would say this man has belief issues.
24,2,0,This is why you should stretch yourself and play in others sandboxes
22,4,0,He keeps crying, "I'm SO sorry, Wilson..."
21,5,1,He said it's the latest physical fitness craze, Death Valley Crawl.
25,0,1,Maybe he is the Bernie Sanders my dad talks about ,and it's his pit now.
21,7,0,He worked with Jackson Pollock.. He may be a while.
22,4,2,I thought if I brought your father back to his childhood, he could better relate to your concerns. I guess he went back too far.
19,5,4,I told him days ago it's our turn.
14,11,2,I hope he's not a cat person!
22,3,1,This is getting weird. Let's go flip those pancakes.
21,4,3,He washed up on the Upper East Side
25,2,2,He got primaried.
27,2,0,I call it 'Training for Death Valley Marathon.'
23,1,1,Looks like Dad forgot to take his Risperdal again.
23,3,1,He just doesn't have time for beach weekends since the promotion.
22,6,1,He's prepping for the Death Valley Fun Run.
16,8,1,Burying your head in our sandbox won't make Trump disappear!
21,0,2,Is this some sort of warning?
23,3,1,I've always said that one man's mirage is just another man's déjà vu.
22,3,0,I thought the new diet craze was supposed to be 'dessert first'.
25,3,0,I call it the "Feel The Bern" mini. You sit in it to convince yourself you're not part of the 1%.
23,5,1,He needs a new therapist.
25,2,2,They call him'The Human Cigarette'.
22,4,0,No bucket. No spade. What else can he play?
18,6,2,Excuse me, but your time is up. We reserved the four o'clock slot.
25,3,0,I must have made a wrong turn somewhere!
27,1,1,His name is Lawrence
22,3,0,It would seem more like a day at the beach if we could wear our swimsuits.
23,4,0,After being bit by a rabid cat, Joe finds the bathroom in his semi catatonic state.
20,5,1,How long WERE you in timeout?
24,3,1,I hope this isn't going to be like when that cat was living here.
26,3,0,It's just his way of acting out some weird, survivalist fantasy.
16,9,3,Mom says you can come back inside now.
24,3,1,His problem is his inability to think outside the box.
19,6,1,He said he doesn't drink city water.
23,4,0,He likes his martinis very dry.
28,0,0,That was the biggest, pinkest cat ever. This is the guy Pay Pal's been missing.
26,2,0,It's a minimum wage job nowadays.
24,4,1,Hey Mister, do you wanna Red Bull?
23,6,0,When my mommy told him to go pound sand, he apparently didn't understand what she really meant.
19,5,0,It's another Trump intern practicing how to draw a line in the sand
24,2,2,I'd ask him to give me a turn, but I don't think I have that level of commitment.
23,5,1,Oh that's just my imaginary friend the English Patient
26,2,0,Don't worry. A 'meow moment' always rejuvenates him.
17,7,2,He's gotta think outside the box.
25,2,0,Denies global warming has he? This treadmill made of sand should convince him otherwise.
20,3,4,This looked more appealing on Pintrest.
25,3,0,marooned in a sandbox without a bucket and shovel
24,2,0,It's great to see Mr. Whiskers so happy again in his new litter box
22,6,0,He must be another method actor.
24,3,1,Promoted to executive sandbox, when the CFO learns to play nicely, we'll give him the pail and shovel.
16,11,1,He's out of the litter box, and that's all I really care about.
25,3,0,Yeah, it's pretty strange but he says it's equivalent to a run around the park without having to deal with other people.
17,6,3,He has trouble thinking outside the sandbox.
20,4,1,He's a cross between Up on the Roof and Under the Boardwalk
26,3,0,Paul. . .Ryan. . .
22,5,1,Poor Fred thinks he's auditioning for Cats again.
23,4,0,At least he's box-trained...
26,2,1,They're filming his audition for a reality TV show.
26,3,0,For the last time, 'I don't know how to do anything else,' is NOT a defense.
19,6,3,A rooftop pool-party sure looks different in the era of global warming.
26,3,0,Do you think he lost something?
24,3,0,They said the ocean was this way?
23,4,1,I hate it when The Catman shows up...
21,4,2,He says he's Lawrence of Sutton Place.
27,2,0,There used to be three ghosts. Daddy calls it a mirage a blah.
24,4,1,There's an app for that.
