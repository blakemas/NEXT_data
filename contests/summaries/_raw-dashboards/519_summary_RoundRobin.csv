19,3,1,Looks like Junior has a new shtick.
21,0,0,Pap's decoys are just getting too pathetic.
17,4,1,Just remember, Cub Scouts was your idea!
19,3,0,Don't be fooled. He does want two in the bush.
16,4,1,Never trust a parrot.
21,0,1,That bird needs to bite the bird seed, not bite the bullet.
11,5,4,Someone should tell him hitchhiking is dangerous
15,4,3,That's what you call going out on a limb.
16,4,0,Well that's one way to "flip him the bird."
19,2,0,Watch out. It's a drone.
18,2,1,She's picketing
22,0,0,The new silent-alarm canary is really hard to hear.
11,6,1,He has neither flight nor fight.
16,2,1,He better hide.............someone else may shoot both of them!
18,2,2,Obviously bred to be a Pointer and not a Retriever.
20,0,0,I hope that's the twitter bird Larry.
15,5,2,I find the new gunsight offensive.
15,6,1,Stay still and no jokes about "riding shotgun"!
14,5,1,His tweet just went viral
15,2,2,He's left the nest. It's not our place to criticize his choice of friends.
18,3,0,He turned out to be a real snake in the grouse.
18,2,0,He must be related to Bernie Sanders.
16,4,2,Darwin at work.
16,5,1,Is he still worth two in the bush?
13,6,2,Believe it or not, he is a sitting duck.
19,3,0,He said he'd whistle if he saw anything dangerous.
15,4,3,He's clearly the one who's 'cuckoo.'
17,1,2,He's a stool pigeon for the gun lobby.
20,1,0,I think that's part of the effette wing of the NRA.
20,0,0,Keith is the dumbest smart bird I've ever met." "100%
20,2,0,' Cooee, he's behind you.'
17,3,0,Safest place our friend could be!!
20,2,0,The rifle's a bluff. He only hunts for worms.
17,4,1,If ya can't beat 'em, join 'em I guess.
13,7,2,Don't you think Junior has taken "riding shotgun" to an extreme.
14,7,1,That's the last place he'll look
16,1,1,Bravery might be a virtue, but far-sightedness is bliss.
14,7,1,Now that's Chutzpah!
14,3,1,Birds of a feather flock together.
15,4,2,I bet him five worms he wouldn't do that.
19,2,0,I tried to tell her that the whole "bird in the hand" thing wasn't about her own self-worth.
20,1,0,Pride of Place, I'd say.
17,3,0,Got her 'big shot' going on again.
14,4,4,Maybe we should get an NRA membership too.
15,4,1,I thought we raised him better than that!
13,5,4,That's his stool pigeon.
13,6,0,Hey! Look behind you!
21,1,0,That's pretty woodcocky.
10,9,2,She's riding shotgun.
20,2,0,It's a hunter's twitter.
16,3,0,They're said to be more agile than Spaniels.
18,2,0,Stay alert - technically, he's not 'in hand.'
12,4,5,I guess it's like being a gay Republican.
15,4,0,Stockholm syndrome strikes again!
16,5,1,Worms! They're hunting worms!
17,1,1,Well, it's what you call the cat bird seat.
11,7,4,Well, you know what they say, "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer!"
19,2,0,Don't fret, he's not one to squawk.
8,5,6,Personally, I prefer not to ride shotgun if I can help it!
19,1,0,That tweet has flown the coop. He's half-cocked.
18,1,2,Very good, but for my 'Truth or Dare' task, I'm going to have to flip him my middle claw.
16,5,1,I knew it when he stopped tweeting.
18,1,1,He's one of those "right to be shot" birdbrains.
14,5,2,Those Bugs Bunny cartoons will be the death of him.
16,4,1,Geez, not sure which one of those two is the bigger birdbrain!
14,1,5,He just keeps re-tweeting it: "The NRA: keeping you safe."
19,1,2,I never figured Ted would turn out to be the stoolpigeon.
14,5,2,Earl is depressed again.
20,1,1,Turntail.
21,1,0,Sure makes living outdoors an adventure.
18,3,1,Guess someone is practicing to be a decoy again.
16,3,2,He's so vain - probably thinks he's worth two of us.
12,6,1,Risk taking! That's your side of the family!
18,1,0,He did say he liked hot sauce and blue cheese.
18,1,3,He's as crazy as a loon....literally.

20,2,0,Come on bro, be a good wingman and distract her friend.
20,0,1,Hard to believe anyone is going to find this funny!
20,1,0,My father told me that in his day 'Mighty Hunter' meant something.
15,3,2,Only a mockingbird would have the nerve!
15,1,0,He likes to be thought of as the 'Bluebird of Mayhem'
12,7,2,Oh, look. Jerry caught another hunter.
17,4,1,Talk about whistling through the graveyard...
16,3,1,Now that we're behind enemy lines, we can win this.
16,1,2,I heard he was scouting for the other side....
17,5,0,Yes, but so last season.
19,2,1,I suppose there are worse hiding places...
15,2,2,He says this is the only way to "make the forest great again"
17,4,0,Yeah, right, now I'll vote for him.
16,2,3,Let's hope a bird on the barrel is worth two in the bush
17,3,2,Ever since they exchanged tweets, she's had his back.
22,1,0,I thought Johnny said he was a pacifist?
17,0,1,He must be a left winger? You think!
20,1,1,He must be using birdshot.
16,4,0,I always suspected that Sparrow boy was hanging with the wrong crowd--there's the smoking gun!
13,3,2,It's time you talked to our son about the facts of life.
17,1,1,Tweet this #irony
12,4,3,Ok. He's in position. By the way, when was the last time YOU mooned a hunter?
17,3,2,Are you live tweeting this?
19,1,1,Goddamn hotshot.
16,2,0,Try new things, challenge yourself, and take control of your life!
14,3,3,I'm not convinced the best defense is a good offense.
17,3,0,If he says he's a bird of fight, I guess we have to believe him.
16,4,2,From here I can't tell if it's a real McCoy or a decoy!
21,0,0,It's like shooting fish in a barrel
16,3,2,To tweet, or not to tweet...
18,2,0,Know thy enemy. Shi. No Tzu.
15,5,1,We pushed him out of the nest too early.
12,5,2,Pfft. Show-off.
12,7,1,Talk about faith in the Endangered Species Act!
17,2,2,Back in my day we were in hands, not on guns.
18,2,1,Do you think he'll sing?
17,3,0,What does he know that we don't know?
14,4,2,In this case, I'm inclined to think that two in the bush are better.
15,3,3,Should we tell Steve that he landed on the wrong branch?
14,3,1,Woah! I'm going to tweet about this!
16,3,2,He's watched too many Bugs Bunny cartoons.
17,2,1,Call me a dove, but the new background check law looks to be toothless.
18,2,1,I told you this was our lucky day, imagine if that bird was in his hand.
15,4,0,your kid has learned to fly, Muzzle Tov !
17,3,1,It's only minimum wage, but it keeps him on his toes.
8,9,2,One thing's for sure, he's no chicken.

18,3,1,I can't believe our own son took a decoy job.
18,1,2,Welcome to Obama's America.
15,3,1,I hope Bambi doesn't fall for this.
15,2,1,After seeing that dumb decoy pasted to his rifle, I now know what the expression "A Schmuck with ear-laps means!"
14,6,2,'I guess a bird in hand really isn't worth two in the bush.'
12,5,3,When I suggested you give him the bird, I did not mean Sonny.

21,0,0,(birds on the tree) You think that man knows?
16,4,1,Junior can only find seasonal employment.
17,2,1,His Twitter feed isn't nearly as interesting as you'd think it would be.
13,7,2,It's times like this I'm glad the two of us are in the bush.
21,1,0,Reason number 951 why people hate pigeons.
19,2,1,That's his dog-bird
13,7,2,Now that's something to tweet about.
20,0,1,Well, there's one we won't have to worry about.
17,0,4,I don't care how sympatico they are, he just doesn't seem right for her.

14,3,2,I think "Conceal-Carry" just got a new meaning
18,4,0,Just like your Aunt Myrtle -- clueless.
16,2,2,He's ALMOST worth the same as us.
20,1,1,Cousin Leroy's love of gun barrels will be the death of him yet!
19,1,0,A real traitor. He tweets when he sees geese
5,8,7,He's not brave. It's deer season.
13,4,4,Look, a cartridge!
18,2,0,I don't understand the appeal, but it's her life.
16,4,1,It took a lot of therapy, but she's forgiven her Dad's killer.
12,5,3,Pat will do anything to win a bet
17,3,0,As long as he keeps quiet, hiding in plain sight could work.
16,2,1,He knows that's not a branch, right?
18,1,0,Well, it is an elegant theory.
16,4,1,Sure, he's endangered, but he's also a jerk.
14,7,0,A delegate in the hand is worth two in the bush.

16,3,1,Showboating again.
13,4,1,Bugs Bunny should show up any minute now.
16,2,2,maybe he should have taken truth.
18,4,1,Obviously left the nest too soon.
11,5,2,Not exactly a bird in hand but I think we might be safe.
18,2,0,We needed a way to continue natural selection
14,7,1,I hate how he insists on riding shotgun all of the time
19,1,1,How many tweets could a twitter twit tweet if a twitter twit could tweet tweets?
18,4,0,It's a decoy, fool!!
14,4,3,Best mocking bird in the business
14,4,0,He seemed oblivious. Surely a bird on the gun was worth two on a branch.
18,3,0,He's engaged to the guy's canary.
16,4,1,Now that's foul!

16,5,1,Tell me, Joe, what's the bet again?
16,3,3,The young ones think they're so clever.
17,3,1,I never expected Jackson to sell himself out like that.
18,3,1,And then he doesn't understand why we call him Benedict Arnold...
18,4,0,Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we're one myopic hunter short of the classic Whip Poor Will maneuver.
20,0,0,So, what did you expect? A black sheep on a .410?
18,2,0,They met when he was skydiving over Yellowstone. They share a love of danger.
19,2,1,Two on a branch is better than one about to lose his head.

14,5,2,He likes living on the edge.
18,3,0,Season's first Benedicta Arnolda.
14,3,2,Don't worry, a bird on the gun is worth two in the bush.
20,0,0,The 'Rugged and Outdoors' Father's Day kit was a big seller this season.
12,6,2,I think we pushed Jr. out of the nest too early.
10,7,4,Well, you did tell him to "keep your friends close and your enemies closer"
17,2,0,A bird on a gun is worth two in a bush.
12,7,1,I always told Jim there's no such thing as a free ride.
18,3,0,He's a coal miner.
20,0,0,Australians call it a riflebird. Americans know it as trumpery.

15,4,1,Don't say anything. Let's see what happens when she turns around.
20,1,1,I've heard of the Riflebird but it's the first time I have actually seen one.
16,5,1,Sure they did a great job capturing your likeness, but posing for hunting decoys seems like a morally-questionable way to start off your modeling career.
16,3,2,"One of these days, Harold's going to go too far".
17,5,0,Using decoys maybe unethical but it evens out when he tries to aim that thing.
16,5,1,As Sun Tzu said, 'Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.'
17,4,0,I didn't know Stacy was pro second amendment did you?
17,2,1,Have gun will travel.
21,1,0,I don't know, Maude. We knew he was different when he was in the nest, but somehow I didn't expect him to be THAT different!
20,0,0,Did that bunting take up hunting?
20,3,0,He won't find us using a stool pigeon.
17,5,0,Peacenick.
11,3,3,Mine doesn't listen to me either.
18,2,0,I dunno. Must have something to do with Trump.
19,2,0,That's what I call playing hard to get.
13,6,1,You see, Bob, this is what Xanax does to people.

18,1,2,Impossible to not shoot birdie on this course.
22,0,0,peep sight?!.. no TRAITOR
18,1,0,It's his part time job being a decoy. He'll do anything to be seen.

16,4,0,...No , it's still too close for comfort .
19,2,0,On the count of three, turn, draw and shoot. One... Two...
15,3,1,I think Tweety should rethink his view on the Second Amendment!
18,2,1,Carol's youngest son joined a radical bird-spy organization.
15,3,2,Hillary is still the safer choice.
11,6,3,Tweety Tweety Bang Bang.
16,5,0,I know the hand, and the bush, but what's the sight worth?
16,5,1,We always knew he was a son of a gun!
13,3,4,I see this friendship ending badly.
15,3,0,I KNEW Bernie Sanders wasn't really a hunter!
17,3,1,I call shotgun next.
14,5,1,Wonder what that's worth..
14,5,1,Well....he is an NRA member!
19,2,0,She caucused for Bernie.
22,0,0,What a token!
16,2,3,What the frick frack snick snack diddily dack crack pack slack mack quarterback crackerjack dental plaque yolk sac does that whack black nonfat flapjack think he’s doin?
13,5,2,I get the feeling this will be our friends last Tweet.
16,5,0,He was always a risk-taker.
15,3,1,I guess two in the bush is worth something after all.
18,2,0,One in the hand is worth two in the bush.
18,3,0,That seems a little more dangerous than just being a bird on a wire.
17,3,1,I don't know how this duel is going to end
15,5,2,Seems like he's everywhere now after that Bernie Sanders podium thing.
19,2,0,Phoebe is such a showboat.
17,5,0,I told that sucker he'd be worth more over there than with us 2 in the bush.
13,6,2,"Now that, my friend, is proof that ignorance is not always bliss".
10,6,5,Those protected species are such smart-asses.
18,3,1,I don't mind his species fluidity. What disturbs me is his support of the NRA.
18,4,0,The man still hasn't realized he can't actually whistle.
20,1,0,Stockholm Syndrome? Maybe, but I'm thinking more like turncoat.
18,2,1,That little tweet is showing off again.
16,2,1,I can't wait to read his tweet.
14,3,5,I'm starting to think he's not college material.
15,7,0,I bet him two worms that he couldn't get close enough to poop on his gun. Looks like it's time to start digging!
16,5,0,Tell Henry to tweet us when he points his gun.
14,4,2,If you can't tweet 'em, join 'em!
18,3,0,So that's what the conservative branch looks like
13,4,2,And you thought tweeting online was dangerous
21,0,0,Appears as if the NRA has brainwashed our little birdbrain.
21,0,0,Relax, it's Elmer Fudds' Great Grandson. Start whistling some Opera and we will really have some fun.
21,1,0,This is probably why they always talk about just Two Little Dickie Birds.
14,3,3,It's not a death wish; he's just stupid.
14,5,1,He plans to live-tweet every shot.
12,6,1,Not in his hand...
16,4,0,Do you think our scout may have made a deal with the enemy?
16,3,1,Hidden in the open usually works.
21,1,0,Blue bird on my shoulder makes me happy.
16,5,1,AND he's tweeting about it. Show-off!
13,6,1,What makes you think they're intelligent?
20,1,0,He must not realize the danger of being a fellow traveler!
14,6,1,One on the gun worth two in the bush.
19,1,1,The best place to hide is on site.
15,5,1,These Millennials are so uninformed.
12,4,3,Must be a peace dove.
11,5,2,Wow, that Brass Balled Warbler really lives up to its name.
20,2,0,The NRA has really gone to the birds this year, wouldn't you say?
11,7,0,Hope that her cell phone doesn't ring.
18,3,1,What's a bird on the gun worth?
22,0,0,He's overthinking if he just wants to kill us.
11,6,4,Sweetie, we might be empty nesters sooner than we thought.
20,1,0,Aha! The first Fudd-Finch of Spring!
17,0,3,I told you Tweety had gone over.
10,11,1,He's much nicer since he's gone vegan.
20,0,0,She's our old style early warning system.
18,2,0,He's safe. There is no app yet.
10,6,5,Teenagers. They think they're invincible.
21,1,0,He told us he could find as easy ride to grandma's tree.
18,0,0,They met about two years ago and he replaced the gun action with a camera.
20,1,0,I need you to look alive when you take the stand.
19,3,0,That's a red breasted quisling.
17,1,1,Where was he when that so called friend of Dick Cheney really needed him?
15,5,1,It's not that surprising. Robins always have had strong feelings about the the right to perch arms.
15,4,1,Actually it's a new kind of scarecrow.
19,2,0,We really need to get glasses for Junior!
15,5,2,Now that's a Cuckoo bird.
14,6,1,I know, Woody's hilarious, he's edgy, he pushes the envelope...but I worry about him.
18,1,0,I thought we would always be together. And that's not a doorstep.
15,4,2,He must be in need of a little seed money...
15,7,0,140 word obit coming up.
14,7,1,That quail knows Dick Cheney shoots only lawyers.
15,4,3,46, 47, 48 - he just might make a new personal best
13,6,2,These kids today with their extreme sports.
20,1,0,Don't worry. He's a remaining delegate. Nobody knows where he is, much less what he wants, including himself.
20,2,0,That's my wingman.
20,0,1,Your delusion is encroaching on our recess.
14,4,3,He said he wanted to take a stand on gun control. I'm not sure he understands the issue.
16,6,1,Well, I, for one, say she is relying too much on her membership card to the NRA.
16,2,2,That's why they call it a Peep Sight.
10,8,4,I tell you, they both need glasses.
17,2,0,It's Elmer and he's a pacifist.
18,3,1,He's not fooling anyone with that decoy.
22,0,0,Why does he perch against his own interests?
22,0,0,Tweetie's been singing about a barrel of laughs.
16,3,2,I like his tweets.
14,5,1,Don't fall for her mating call--I think it could be a trap.
16,3,1,I completely get it. Flying isn't as much fun as it used to be.
19,3,0,Looks like Bertie decided to go with Tree-Mobile.
17,4,1,Show some respect, it's the changing of the bird ceremony!
18,4,0,And we wonder why the "birdbrain" label continues to this day.
16,3,2,I believe that's what they call cavorting with the enemy.
17,3,0,It's actually pretty safe there.
18,2,0,She's a firm believer in gun patrol.
13,6,2,Performance artists are the worst.
13,6,2,Cataracts.
16,5,1,I still can't believe our kid joined the N.R.A!
15,5,0,no, the mustache is real
18,3,1,Well, he's got her back.
21,0,0,He wasn't like this before those jays moved into the neighborhood.
20,1,0,It won't make a difference. He doesn't have the votes.

20,1,1,Two chirps from that war bird, and I advise we hit the dirt.
13,7,1,One day his pranks will backfire on him
14,4,2,I know, it's crazy, but he says he's hiding in plain sight.
17,4,0,He's getting a little cocky ever since that Bernie incident.
14,6,2,He should've chose "truth".
18,1,2,He likes to see the sights.
14,4,0,I'm not sure. I left my binoculars back at the nest.

14,4,1,It's the latest decoy for nearsighted hunters.
15,3,0,Young and foolish, just like her mother

16,3,1,It's cheaper than Uber.
13,4,4,'He got the idea from Bugs Bunny."
19,1,0,I love scarecrows with a perch
18,4,1,Look at her up there so proud. I wish he will just shoot her.
17,3,0,you know the old saying? "one bird on the barrel is worth two in the bush"
18,5,0,Irony, it's a beautiful thing.
18,2,1,That size queen won't ride anything less than a 12-gauge.
17,4,0,Ugh. Bernie Bros.
19,0,0,You're right -- that's no pigeon and that ain't no stool, but ...
18,4,0,Not to worry...it's just a presidential candidate looking for a photo-op
14,4,5,yeah, but to win the bet he still has to poop in the barrel
14,4,3,He always said he wanted to play chicken.
21,0,0,Hey, he wants it on HIS terms.
19,2,0,I think it will take more than that one to make two in the bush.
20,2,0,You know what they say, "one on the gun..."
16,3,2,The birdbrain volunteered to ride shotgun.
16,5,1,Irv has always been a risk taker.

15,5,1,Dave, have you seen a better analogy for this year's election?
16,4,2,He better not tweet about this.
11,3,5,Mockingbird, pretty sure.
18,2,1,I'm not sure, but apparently he has some inherent knowledge of "wabbits."
18,2,1,I hear the pension plan was too good to refuse
22,0,0,Progressive birds look on as one of their own lands on the rifle Bernie Sanders is hunting members of the Establishment with.

16,3,2,His dream has always been to be a bird of prey.
14,5,3,Who taught him how to ride shotgun?
18,3,1,He obviously was the first to call "shotgun."
15,3,2,He thinks the guy is Elmer Fudd.
17,2,0,It makes sense. The old guy can't afford a real scope, and Fred hates ducks.
21,1,0,Well that is indeed a bold move, but the physics support that strategy.

15,2,4,He'll do anything to avoid flying south for the winter.

10,7,5,He likes to ride shotgun.
17,2,1,Ever since we were kids, he's always been first to call shotgun.
13,8,0,Oooooooh, why didn't I think of that?
14,6,2,Are you sure it's 'just a phase'?
11,8,3,Yeah, he always has to ride shotgun.
17,0,2,To the left!
11,5,4,He's taken "riding shotgun" to a new level.
14,5,2,If you think about it, he really is in the safest spot.
20,1,1,Well, Jay always said "The best defense is a shotgun offense."
16,4,3,I believe it's called Woodcock Syndrome.
16,3,3,I told her hitchhiking was dangerous!
17,3,1,Perkins! A theory. Is a bird on a barrel worth two in the bush?

14,5,0,Let me guess ... It's his first time as a Lookout.
19,1,1,Are you sure that's a Timex?
18,2,1,Ugh. Stoolies!
7,10,3,Not the best lookout we've ever had.
21,0,0,Definitely. The bird bird is much better than the bird dog--looking out for us!
20,2,0,Well two birds in the.bush TRUMPS that.
18,3,0,He's got chutzpah I'll give him that.
19,3,0,Probably should have told him I'm his mother...
19,2,0,How many birds in the bush are worth one on the gun?
19,1,0,Jay has always been very gutsy
14,5,0,Ah, dramatic irony.

14,6,1,Does he really think we'll fall for that?
12,5,3,Dumb and dumber.
16,3,1,What's that saying again? A bird on the barrel is worth two in the bush laughing hysterically?
10,8,2,It beats working in the mines.
12,3,5,Bird 1: "There goes another gun-toting Trump supporter finally leaving the woods to attend a rally." Bird 2: "And there goes another tree-hugging Sanders supporter catching a free ride."
17,2,0,He is blinded by the camouflage.
16,3,0,Benedict Audubon!
17,3,2,He's always free loading something. That's just the way he is.
17,4,1,He was far from the brightest egg in the nest.

13,8,1,Gary really hangs with a different crowd since he joined the NRA.

12,7,0,I didn't know we had the right to bear arms!
18,2,1,What a sight.
18,4,0,Not sure he understands the phrase BIRD's EYE VIEW.
15,4,0,I still think military school was a bad idea
15,6,0,let's fly- that's a stool pidgeon sitting on that gun
21,1,0,What makes him so sure that the hunter is deaf and dumb?
17,3,0,You must be new in the neighborhood. Don't worry, it's a statue.
15,4,2,He puts her by the sight to get a bird's-eye view.
13,7,3,Anyone who falls for that decoy, deserves to get shot.
11,7,4,Apparently his last stunt had 4 million views.
16,4,1,Nothing like having good hindsight!
16,3,0,What a show-off. There's a thin line between guts and goofy.
19,1,1,It's an open carrier.
18,2,0,I guess you're not being paranoid; he IS targeting us specifically.
11,8,1,Uh oh, looks like Helen is off her meds.
15,5,1,Do you think it's wise for him to to mock the NRA?
17,1,2,What a brown beak.
20,2,0,He will tweet once if by forest and twice if by meadow.

15,6,1,Keep your friends close...
14,5,1,Maybe we shouldn't have lined the nest with 'Field and Stream.'
18,2,0,I thought you told him not to play chicken
21,0,0,He won't listen to his dad or me, his showing off is going to get him shot!
18,2,0,Must be that Vermonter.

18,3,0,He's fallen behind with his ophthalmologist payment plan.
18,1,1,Maybe it's deer season.
16,5,0,He's trying the Looney Tunes approach to not getting shot.
12,5,5,If you're not going to tweet about this, I am.
14,5,1,He turned to me and said, "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer," and then just took off!
19,1,1,I think it's known as a peep sight.
17,4,1,I sure hope that counts as 'one in the hand'.
18,3,0,I'm going to need that Branch Analysis Report Jay
19,1,2,Do you think we should call that idiot songbird over here?
20,3,0,When you think about it, maybe he's not so crazy after all.
12,5,4,Better than working the coal mines.
15,5,1,I always thought our son was a bit of a strange bird.
20,1,0,We call it a Scare Hunter - makes other hunters go away.
19,1,0,Can't really call it a 'sit-in' can we? More like a 'sit-on.' Risky, ain't it? Still, that human will think twice. Feathered lives matter!

16,5,1,Lionel always had boundary issues
18,1,0,Her mother was a sparrow.
16,4,2,Shhh, don't fall for it. It's Wayne LaPierre trying to pull off the old Charles Schulz and Woodstock impersonation again.

17,3,0,That's my boy!
15,2,4,He self-identifies as a bloodhound.
16,3,1,'Bluebird of Happiness;' and he'll never find it!
19,1,2,Eggs Benedict anyone?
18,2,0,He must be an animal rights hunter.
17,1,2,Of course, I might be wrong...but I think hunting with him might be a real blast!
11,6,1,He loves to remind us that he's not a game bird.
16,4,2,I told you it was a cult.

18,2,0,So a little birdie told him so.
17,5,0,Boy....that Todd was never one to be gun shy.
16,5,1,He's so out of your league.
10,10,1,Gotta love being the two birds in the bush in this situation.
16,4,1,I'd be impressed if we were even in season.
17,2,0,You're right, they're both clueless.
19,2,0,Forget the exchange rate, we're not leaving this bush.

15,3,3,It's obvious--it's a decoy
15,4,2,Who knew birds had balls?
17,3,1,*sigh* . . . you think you know a bird.
18,2,1,One of these days that's going to come back to bite him!

18,1,3,One of these days he'll go too far...
13,7,0,We need to review the lesson on situation awareness
13,5,1,That is why that species is almost extinct.

16,5,0,He's taking this Hamilton craze a bit too far.
16,4,2,Now watch, he's about to fire off another tweet.

21,0,0,Something about a horse with no name, I don't know.
16,3,0,Talk about 'stay close to your enemies."
15,6,1,Hunters: they love you at sparrow size, but put on a few pounds and suddenly you're a piece of meat
20,2,1,A bird on the barrel is worth two in the bush.
11,6,3,He's seriously worth two of us?
12,7,2,He's from Compton. Nothing scares him.
16,5,1,I think the hazing has crossed the line.
17,5,1,His philosophy is to keep your enemies close.
18,3,0,Is it too risky to make enough noise to expose that little showoff?
17,3,1,That's true. But, they do have opposable thumbs.

15,3,3,Is a bird on the gun worth two in the bush?
14,5,1,That hare-brained son of ours is always pushing the envelope.
16,3,1,Hal lives by 'love thy enemies.' Seems risky to me.
15,3,1,Guess he never heard of the "Big Bang" theory.

16,5,1,I always knew he was a turn feather.
16,4,0,There is the traitor!

14,6,2,I want to tweet about this, but it could kill him.
16,2,2,There aren't any NRA supporters on my side of the family..
18,1,0,"Looks like classic Stockholm Syndrome." "Or maybe her pirate just got a stick.l

20,0,1,Just gunning for it...
16,3,1,So how much do you think Jimmy is getting paid to be a Spotter?
21,0,1,Even the fledgling knows it's only a prop.
14,2,3,If he gets that in his hand, we're safe.
15,4,0,I feel so betrayed! Leonard promised me the NRA membership application I found was just fodder for our nest.
14,5,1,If he looks at you and says watch the birdie, fly!
14,4,3,Believe me, with this strategy he'll learn to fly in no time.
14,6,1,Damn. Fred always gets to ride shotgun!

15,5,0,He started showing off when he realized he's worth double what we are
17,1,0,Hey bud, do you think he changed hobbies yet?

18,3,1,Sweet bird of youth- his endangered species status came thru.
19,2,0,I heard he's voting for Trump
13,6,2,Must be first day of rabbit season.
18,2,1,He's definitely not worth more than us.
18,1,3,No, Jerry! Don't look inside! ITS NOT A BIRD FEEDER!
14,5,2,I have got to tweet about this!

18,1,2,So all he wanted was three night crawlers and some mealworms?
16,3,2,I told you he's got some huevos.
19,0,0,She's a strict constructionist. She took a job as a lobbyist for the NRA.
20,1,0,Do you think he knows yet?
18,4,0,That's carrying "bi-partisan" too far.
17,3,1,Nope, that's a Nark.
17,1,1,I despise him with every feather of my being.
18,2,1,Bernie's stand on gun control contains many contradictions.

20,2,0,He needed help whistling while he worked.

19,2,0,I'm old school, but I'm down with 'live tweets'!
17,3,0,The over is 2 minutes.

20,0,0,Don’ thirstbucket Berd, she ratchet, na’ mean?
16,3,1,I would just like to have a little of his hauteur.
19,3,0,It's his own way of honoring the pigeons in Tiananmen Square.
13,4,3,It's bold, it's daring, and it just might work.
15,1,3,This could end up being one heck of a tweet
18,1,0,Apropos your issue! "Looks like Trump has chosen Dick Cheney for the ticket"
13,5,4,Maybe we raised him to be a little too trusting.
19,0,0,There goes Bernie Sanders!

15,2,1,Looks like another little grouse for gun control.
10,3,8,She always insists on riding shotgun.

22,0,0,Great, we can invite the family over this weekend.
18,1,2,Her tweets could kill.
17,2,2,Old Herbert isn't much of a shot, but outright mockery is just a step too far.

17,2,0,That's how we put a bird on it.
13,8,1,He subscribes to the practice of hiding in plain sight.
14,5,1,But is it "Ha Ha" funny?
20,2,0,Ironically, he's a lovebird.
13,2,4,I keep trying to accept his new lifestyle.
16,5,0,That's not exactly what I meant when I said to him: 'Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.'
18,1,0,I'm calling it, 'Birdie over Cheney.' Or maybe just, 'Put a Bird on It.'
13,5,3,He just loves riding 'Shotgun'!
18,3,0,Blue jay, red state.
14,4,3,He likes keeping his friends close but his enemies closer.
13,3,3,Kids are calling it 'rifling'; say it's a real rush

19,2,1,Fred is either mounting a protest, creating an ironic image, or just taking a rest.
18,1,0,Classic size envy.
19,1,2,He clearly needs a refresher on how to use decoys.

12,4,5,I get the feeling we have nothing to worry about.
18,3,0,Darwin was definitely onto something with his "survival of the fittest" theory.

22,0,0,Isn't that the Bernie Sanders bird?
17,4,1,Yeah, he grew up in a museum
12,5,2,I think that the term 'riding shotgun' seems to get lost in translation for birds.
22,0,0,I think that's the Beretta Silver Pigeon.
15,6,0,I told you not to trust that bird.
16,3,3,Remember--he's more scared of us than we are of him.
12,8,1,Some say 'brave' but I say 'stuffed'
21,1,0,Two birds in the bush is worth on bird on the rifle.
14,2,4,One of them is going to learn the hard way.

12,4,3,Not another chick magnet.
15,5,1,My son is no genius but always finds friends that make him seem smart.
18,3,0,No one screws you like your own.
15,5,0,I told him "youth is wasted on the gun"
20,1,0,I don't know which one's more stupid.
17,3,0,Duck or he'll start singing like a canary!
16,3,1,So that's what they mean by 'carrying a cocked gun'
14,4,2,If you think about it, that is actually the safest place to be.
16,4,0,He was triple-dog dared, so yeah...
18,2,0,Now is not the time to feed Junior!
16,3,0,I'm afraid that Bernie Sanders caper has made him overconfident.
16,1,2,I wish we had the guts to flip him the bird.
15,3,0,He's taking your keep-your-enemies-close advice to an extreme.
16,5,1,For once I would like him to choose "truth" in our Truth or Dare.
19,2,0,So what do you think Ralph? "He looks a little goofy." "Shall we give him a thrill?
15,5,1,Must be a Democrat.
19,2,0,as if the dogs weren't bad enough

18,3,0,MY genes? YOU'RE the one with the backward brother!
16,4,1,Why would he attach that to his gun? I'm gonna go in for a closer look.
16,4,3,'Keep your friends close and your enemies closer' is one thing. This is just stupid.
15,5,1,Almost makes you rethink opposition to the 2nd Amendment.
18,3,1,Well, honey, you raise 'em the best you can, but sooner or later they have to make their own decisions.
16,6,0,See? Ever since he modeled for the Twitter logo he thinks he can do anything.
13,6,2,She keeps her friends close, but her enemies closer.
16,5,2,Don't worry, he's hunting wabbits.
14,4,2,Awww, she always calls shotgun!
13,5,3,Obviously, we have our own Benedict Arnold!
18,2,0,Bird in the bush 1: Wait...shouldn't that bird be in his hand??? Bird in the bush 2: WAIT a MINUTE...that's a decoy !!!!!
14,3,2,I've always wanted to ride shotgun.

16,2,2,You've gotta give it to Bobby, he's got the best mating strategy in the forest.
17,1,1,We've been quite safe since the Republicans went Trump.
19,1,0,That how they got the indians, using one of our own.
18,2,1,Don't believe it. He's a decoy.
19,1,0,Typical jaywalking behavior.
19,1,0,If you can't fight 'em, join 'em.
18,2,0,I've told him more than once--ever since we moved to Wyoming his go-to strategy no longer qualifies as foolproof.
15,4,2,If he's smart, he'll wait before he tweets about this.
20,2,1,Look! It's a gun barrel warbler.
13,3,5,...I hear he tweets for the NRA
19,2,0,The Arnold's had one bad egg named Ben.
19,1,1,I can't see you, you can't see me
15,2,1,That's the worst decoy I've ever seen.
19,3,0,Boom Chica Boom.
14,6,1,I can't believe that Bernie is pandering to the gun lobby!
15,2,3,He must feel a lot safer with somebody riding shotgun.
9,9,1,That taxidermist isn't fooling anyone!!
16,5,1,It's called a peep sight.
21,0,0,Look it's a wrongbird
16,4,1,You have got to admire his fearlessness, he just doesn't give a tweet.
20,0,0,Maybe she thinks it's his cell phone.
14,5,3,I disagree with where she stands on gun control
19,0,2,Well, he did call it first.
18,3,0,I wouldn't call that a bird in hand.

18,3,0,He's new to this game
17,2,1,See that Judith? They call that the 1%
17,4,1,He adores Elmer Fudd and Tweetie Bird.

15,2,3,Looks like a suicide by hunter.
21,1,0,I always knew he was a Stool pigeon.
11,8,2,Darn, I bet him four worms he couldn't get away with that.
11,9,1,She's always liked living on the edge....
6,12,3,The kids call it ‘riding shotgun.’
18,4,0,I'm so over it -- birds don't really make everything cuter.
17,3,0,...and we ask yourselves, how in the hell do we keep risking extinction?
18,3,1,First Bernie's podium, now some NRA guy...What does your nephew have against Hillary?
15,4,1,Yikes! He definitely should have gone with truth.
18,3,1,Who is the bird brain now?
20,1,0,This isn't the beach, Gill...
15,4,1,We may found out now whether she's really worth the two of us combined.
21,0,0,Ever notice that hunters on Twitter seem most conflicted about dove season?

13,5,1,He thinks he's a big shot now.
14,6,1,I hear he's peeping with the enemy
21,1,0,He'll probably want his money back on those invisible seeds you sold him.
9,5,3,Honey, when exactly were you planning to teach Junior about hunting season?
18,4,0,Must be an election year.
12,3,3,Ok, if he can stay there for another two minutes, he's in the club.

14,5,0,She was rescued from a coal mine.
18,3,0,Our admissions counselor felt he needed more real-world experience.
18,2,2,I can't argue with the logic - it just doesn't feel like the safest spot.

18,2,1,That's a site !
13,6,2,He joined the NRA.
14,4,2,He's taking his stand on guns a little too far this time.
15,2,1,Talk about a bird in the hand!
18,4,0,Ignorant or ironic, I ask you.
15,5,0,I don't know about you, but that seems worth a lot more than 'two in the bush' to me!
18,3,0,I think he's more of a deer person.
17,3,1,Which one is the bigger birdbrain?
12,9,1,I told him not to call Uber!
18,4,0,He's such a show-off.
19,2,0,His name is Neville Chamberlain
13,7,1,I guess Darwin was wrong on at least two counts.
12,5,2,I always took him for a stool pigeon.
17,4,0,#Zippidy Doo Da
18,1,0,There goes Cousin Tom

17,2,2,There's double-dog dare, and then there's being a bird brain.
20,0,0,bird1:thats not a branch! bird2:looks like a good branch,i might join him.
18,3,1,Worst use of a decoy ever.
14,6,1,I'm suddenly and inexplicably hot for him.
19,2,0,Bet you 50 bucks he picks his nose.
18,2,0,That way, when he tweets, he can see who his followers are.
16,4,1,Something about that tree looks a little off.
17,3,1,The way he shoots it is the safest place to be
13,9,0,They both need glasses.
15,4,0,Watch out, he's trying that old "bird in the hand" decoy again.

16,6,0,Looks like he's got Chirpy over a barrel.
17,3,1,Our editor wants another Trump caption. Any thoughts?
14,4,2,Is that worth two in the bush?
17,3,1,OK, stop me if you have heard this one before.
