41,7,2,Let me mansplain it to you.
38,1,1,I got here by playing 'portal'.
44,9,3,Am I holier than thou?
40,8,1,I got my halo at Costco.
39,5,3,Sun protection is so important, especially up here.
40,7,1,You make me downright upright.
40,11,0,Footwear? Size 14 medium, why do you ask?
39,7,1,I cannot bear false witness; I'm overcompensating.

39,7,0,don't say it , I know , I should have got out more
41,14,1,It's not mine, I fell through it

38,7,0,I swear it does not make your butt look big.
40,10,0,What in heaven's name would make you think I'm going through a mid-death crisis?

38,6,0,I just wish they'd stop calling me Goody Two Shoes.
40,10,2,As you can see I'm not that kind of guy.
41,6,2,How'd you know I spent 12 years in Catholic school?
44,22,4,I always remembered to put the toilet seat down.
43,6,4,Naw! It's just a hole in the ozone layer.
34,4,0,You were a vice president of sales too?
37,4,0,And you thought you were through the glass ceiling?

40,5,2,Wow, those pills really do work don't they.

43,11,2,What do you mean I'm too halocentric?

39,5,1,I guess I'm just more hole-y than you.
43,8,3,I promise you it's not compensation for anything
43,14,2,Never hurts to ask for an upgrade...
42,11,2,Actually, it's a hula hoop. I didn't qualify for a halo.
38,7,1,Oh...just a lifetime of resistance training.
42,5,4,Yeah that's right. I invented the cloud.
46,6,6,St. Peter likes geometry teachers.

37,4,0,I'm Gabe. Fifth generation.
36,4,0,It turns out they didn't need it for Trump.
36,4,0,yes mine is bigger than yours

37,1,0,You're looking good. I didn't know angles flew so high.
32,1,0,Well, it's really in how you use it...
38,7,0,Does this make my feet look big?
46,7,5,My shrink says overcompensation is common during an afterlife crisis.
61,12,5,Well, you know what they say, the bigger the halo...
40,2,2,Unfortunately, halo size is inversely proportional to that...
43,16,1,It may look impressive, but I haven't been able to sleep a wink in eighty years.
49,24,10,It was the small things, like putting the toilet seat down every time.
38,5,1,WOW ! I was afraid you would be some crazy guy with B.O. and a beard.
39,3,1,Back on earth my shoe size was 13.
37,2,1,Despite the small hands...

37,2,0,I honestly do not feel anymore blessed than Kanye West
49,11,7,Aaargh! How embarrassing. It'll be back to normal in a bit.
38,2,1,Even above the ceiling, yours is still only 78% of mine.
40,8,1,I assure you, everyone benefits from the newly privatized halo industry.
39,4,1,This is much more accurate than the shoe size analogy.
45,16,5,It's for putting the seat down.
53,24,10,Hey, you had me at halo.
36,0,0,My brother will be here in a minute. He just stopped off to go to the bathroom.

40,3,3,No I’m not over compensating, I’m the inventor of the Hula Hoop.
42,8,2,I got mine from Costco!
38,7,0,No, I don't notice any difference.

45,10,4,How the hell did you get in here?
36,3,2,How did you know that I made it myself?
37,2,1,Every time I open my mouth, one of these comes out.
40,9,2,I atoned, but steroids have after effects.
38,8,1,Well, if you got equal pay you could have afforded this one.
46,8,4,"Halo affect" trumps "halo effect".

35,4,0,Given to those who still have a huge ego, I'm proud to say.
38,3,1,Welcome to heaven

35,2,0,I borrowed this from the BFG

38,5,0,Heavenly Cubans...make perfect smoke rings.
36,10,1,You say Hoover DAM, I say Hoover DARN.
42,7,3,I was always overcompensating.
50,15,8,Let me just say I am very blessed.
43,7,3,I behaved badly, but I made up for it with a lot of guilt.
38,4,1,Yeah sister, disparity even here!
36,5,0,You know the old saying..."The bigger a guy's halo, the bigger his you-know-what!"

41,7,2,...so Peter said 'would you like to be holy or super-holy?' so I sa...

39,5,1,All they left was the extra-extra large.
38,6,0,Let me tell you something - there is no problem with the size of my hands.
43,9,3,I think it was my insistence on eating only sustainable arugula.
41,8,2,Some stretching is normal during rebirth.
44,3,5,It's been over five hours, I'm calling God.
42,6,3,No Internet.

39,6,1,It humors the boss too.
36,0,0,You're a jet, but I'm still piston.
47,13,6,The funny thing is, I was a Buddhist!
44,17,4,I'm not taking it in until I'm sure I'll keep the weight off.
41,3,3,Since we can't see our feet up here, it's the size of a man's halo that's indicative of ... you know.
43,8,3,If you really must know, the Father is my uncle and the Son is my cousin.
39,7,0,Seriously, it's not because I'm a man. In life, I was a hula hoop champ.
45,16,4,So.....just how naughty were you?
41,14,0,My friends called me goody two shoes

35,2,0,Big head, big halo
36,2,1,Curiously, size matters, even here.
37,2,0,The size of my halo is based on the amount of money I paid to my wife's ring.
42,6,3,Want to see my hands?
42,11,2,and I don’t like to brag, but all this you see is God given

37,2,0,It's hard to find magnum hats.
41,4,2,The large halo? Well, I've always been very competitive.

38,8,0,I know it looks big, but it's comfortable.
40,4,2,Yes, size matters in heaven.

40,7,1,Yeah, well my ex-wife said I was always Holier than Thou.
41,3,2,I guess that Woman Card doesn't get you everything.
39,3,1,They call me mellow halo -- quite rightly
44,10,8,So embarrassed - but it's not you - I woke up with this...
49,8,8,Believe me, if I had met you, this would be a much smaller halo.

41,8,2,It's true; size really does matter, even here in Heaven.
36,1,0,Even up here the male is exalted but not prettier.
39,2,1,Halo angel face, haven't seen you flying around here before.
47,8,6,Yep, I did get it at Costco.

39,3,2,Hey, foreplay on the freeway was your idea.
37,0,0,*girl angel* That halo so doesn't look good on you.

35,4,0,When it's all said and done, size is ALL that matters!
45,17,5,Sure, you had more fun, but I get to be sanctimonious for eternity.
42,11,2,Yeah, I'm REALLY good.
39,1,2,Believe it or not, it's a hula hoop.

41,8,2,Does halo size even matter here in Heaven? Only one way to find out...
44,8,4,So now I know what happens when an erection lasts longer than four hours.

44,5,4,Now who thinks size doesn't matter?
42,8,3,Err, I gave Sister Teresa a free cab ride once.
37,3,0,Why don't you go to the Boss and ask for a smaller halo?

38,18,0,No, seriously. I'm a bad boy.
41,7,3,I know, you want to see my hands.
44,8,4,Believe me, if the two were connected, I wouldn't be standing here right now.
37,3,1,Apparently some of us shared more religious quotes and type amen!
48,11,6,I'm glad to see you too.
42,3,2,Back in the 70's I played harp for Aerosmith.
43,10,4,I am the guy who invented The Pill
49,11,7,Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I AM holier than thou.
38,2,1,If we weren't angels, I would definitely want to date you
44,8,4,Fooled me too, I thought I was going there as well.
41,2,1,I'M GAY
43,9,3,Yeah, well I invented the hula hoop.
34,2,0,So size does matter after all.
43,10,3,I had it made to fit my ego.
37,1,1,Pinocchio, welcome upstairs. Watch what you say!
42,6,3,And how much did you donate to the St. Peter 2016 PAC?
39,4,1,Er.. this will change. It's just that you are the first feminist
43,15,2,For a few extra good deeds I was able to super size it.
44,3,4,Yeah, baby, and you know what THAT means...
43,4,3,You can vote for whomever you want, it's the holier than thou attitude that I have an issue with.
42,7,3,All angels are holy, but some angels are holier than others.
38,2,1,And I was like, "OMG, is that really, you?", and he was like, "DUDE, totally righteous!"
41,1,3,Let's put it this way. My hands aren't tiny either.
47,14,5,I bought mine at Costco.
39,5,2,They're supposed to compensate for the loss of our penises.
38,3,1,"It's bigger cause I only committed near occasions of sin".
46,17,4,I always left the toilet seat down.
44,9,5,Something tells me this is better than meeting online.
36,0,0,Ok---do you have a cigarette?
36,9,0,But yours looks more comfy.
38,2,1,My name is Trump, Donald Trump.
36,2,0,You mean size counts...up here?
43,8,3,it gets bigger round pretty angels like you
36,4,0,Come here often?
36,3,1,Turns out size does matter.
43,8,1,Yeah...that's what they all say.
41,12,1,AND big feet
43,10,3,No, it's not natural. I had it enlarged.
45,7,4,It's supposed to last for up to five hours.
47,14,5,Right before I died, I doubled my contribution to PBS.
37,6,0,No, no. It's just my Hula-Hoop.
42,7,2,You know what they say about angels with large halos...
35,0,1,It's the biggest one here.
33,1,0,I wanted the larger halo
40,11,1,Trust me, being too good to be true, is not all it's cracked up to be.
43,10,4,It's true what they say about the size of your halo.
38,3,0,Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
45,8,5,What can I say? Size matters.
48,13,7,I really am that good.
39,6,1,I brought the potato salad to the church picnic.
36,2,0,What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
36,1,0,It's my male enhancement halo that got me in
36,0,0,Upgrade your firmware , eeeesh , sorry I meant to say software ...
38,4,0,Just my luck: up here size really doesn't matter and I'm very well endowed.
37,5,0,"It's a great chick magnet"!
35,2,0,Since yours is bigger than mine, you go first.
39,3,2,gays get the supersize
39,10,4,I tipped the guy at the gate.
46,11,4,Of course that old saying is true! The bigger the halo the bigger the . . .
35,3,0,Do we need to take our halos off too?
36,3,0,No, Sarah, I insist. You stay, I'll find another shoulder.
40,3,2,Don't let the small hands fool you.
39,3,1,I kept misplacing my regular halo so I have to wear this for a while.
38,2,1,Very funny. Truth is, I died in a pop-up store dressing room.
45,28,3,It's a rental.
38,7,0,So I said to Gabriel, "Believe me, I know die-ameter." But seriously......
40,10,1,I'm from Original Ray's Pizza. Did you order a plain, extra large ?
38,3,2,I'm sorry. I don't believe we are compatible.
42,7,3,Jesus is coming, look busy!
42,7,2,I have large hands too.
42,5,3,Oh, yeah...and I also love puppies.
35,1,0,Female angel's thought: "Is he compensating for something?"
36,1,0,Yah. In my time on earth, I was big into Hoola-hoopin.
46,12,6,is that a hula hoop on your head or are you just happy to see me?
39,10,1,Only an angel would say that size makes no difference.
51,12,9,It means exactly what you think it means.
44,8,4,Yeah, even in Heaven there's a Gender Gap !
35,0,1,You see I'm special. My waist and halo are the same size.
38,8,0,What do you mean, what am I compensating for?
42,10,1,My team really deserves the credit; it's too bad they're in hell.
39,9,0,It's how you use it.
39,7,1,Relax! It's a Hula Hoop.
36,2,0,Want a Bite of My Apple?
41,10,1,It turns out that tithing fifteen per cent from gross is better than fifteen net.
37,8,0,Let's ditch the halos and get on with it
37,1,0,I know...It's obvious I'm not the bad boy type.
38,4,0,Yeah, back on Earth I used to take a lot of flak for my holier than thou attitude.
36,2,1,So, do you still say that size doesn't matter?
37,2,1,It was easier to compensate on Earth.
51,13,9,In hindsight, I wish I had more sex.
41,5,3,I don't wish to seem holier than thou, but...
36,0,0,I won the Mine Is Bigger Then Yours contest.
49,18,8,What can I say? I'm holier than thou.
39,2,2,I'm good on my knees.
75,27,26,Remember all those times you said I was wrong?
38,7,0,Yes, Virginia, there is a glass ceiling in Heaven also.
36,1,0,You know what they say about big halos and body parts!
37,0,0,Yeah, it's Donald Trump's kid. Obviously compensating for his tiny little binky.
36,2,0,His standards were a bit higher in the 30's.
36,3,0,I'm like a black hole. I suck up other peoples' positive auras.
36,2,0,Sorry I'm late, I was having sudden misgivings on murder-suicide.
37,2,1,That's how we roll.
44,4,3,It enables a better shower.
43,12,3,I was surprised to find a Costco up here
42,10,2,Haaaalooo there.
41,8,1,Your virtue, no matter how small, is safe with me.
44,11,3,Costco.
35,8,0,I have seniority.
39,4,1,You should see my feet.
40,5,2,it's a bonus award from my visa account
43,8,3,I'm no angel.
39,12,3,Is your halo always that big, or are you just happy to see me?
39,8,0,Oh for heaven's sake yes. Size matters.
38,3,1,I guess they went by the size of my hands.
36,5,0,Size matters everywhere, my dear.
36,2,2,I'm afraid the glass ceiling stinks to high heaven.
41,5,3,I hope it looks as big as it does on Tinder.
43,9,2,And whats ironic is the halo is the exact size as the open manhole!
38,4,1,You know what they say about the size of your halo
44,8,3,It was the only size they had left.
40,4,1,Well, in our world size does matter.
37,1,1,I invented the grain bowl.
39,8,0,I need all the help I can get
38,2,1,Welcome! It's defective!!
43,12,2,So there's a halo gap in heaven?
56,21,13,It's been like this for 4 hours.
38,8,1,It turns out that halo enhancement surgery is sort of frowned on around here.
38,5,1,Come on, Beth, why the smerk? You know what they say...big halo...
40,8,2,Its a lot of pressure.
38,1,1,Is that a halo on your head or do you love me?
46,12,7,Ok, ok. So I am a little excited to see you. How did you know?
41,11,2,"Now if I remember correctly, you got our house, summer home, and the sailboat. I got to keep my tools and the Porsche".
40,9,1,You know I REALLY do like you.
42,6,3,Of course, it is a ring of confidence.
36,2,1,Now, I don't want to appear holier at hand thou, but...
36,5,0,It's true what they say: big halo ...
40,7,2,Yeah, I used to have a swelled head. Somehow, everybody knows.
42,16,0,One of many hoops I had to jump through to get here.
44,9,3,I'll bet your wondering how good I've been.
37,3,0,It is hardly ythe "blessing" one would think it should be.
33,0,0,Halo it's me. I've thought about us for a long, long time
37,2,0,Sorry, but even up here, I'm still just a show-er.
35,2,0,And then, she made me an Archangel.
55,34,14,It's a little cumbersome but I get great Wi-Fi.
39,3,1,There's something I saw 2 eagles do that I'd like to show you.
44,14,4,The Seraphim got a deal at Costco.
48,18,7,My trouble is getting close to people.
38,4,0,And you thought a big head disqualified you from getting in?
39,10,0,They ran out of halos. I got a hula hoop.
47,12,5,Yeah, hula hoop accident. What about you?
44,13,5,They let me upgrade in Atlanta.
40,2,2,I was on Atkins..
51,18,10,I drove a Prius and I didn't talk about it much.
45,6,6,I shot Donald Trump.
47,11,6,...and then God said, "Why didn't I think of that?"
41,3,2,I was hit by a car in the Costco parking lot.
42,12,2,Do they shrink the longer you've been here?
40,1,3,not only is my halo bigger than most, but God asks for my counsel frequently
44,11,2,Wouldn't you like to know...
40,3,2,Mine was very popular in the '50s.
38,4,1,Heey-looo
39,5,1,Apparently I have a big head.
39,5,1,Thanks. Wish I could say the same thing about my, um, hands.
39,6,1,I know, it looks ridiculous.
37,4,1," I've been asked that same question for an eternity and the answer is not just 'yes' but 'hell yes'".
50,13,7,It's crazy! When they said the double reward points never expire, they were right!
37,4,0,Thanks, but I think you have the wrong idea. I have a bad case of halotosis.
39,10,1,I've lost a little weight.
37,4,0,Viagra and nitrates don't mix.
37,1,1,I was the fifth grade hula hoop champion.
44,7,5,It was really hell getting this good.
36,1,0,Trump's hands.
41,8,2,Most people just don’t get my holier-than-thou attitude.
46,22,4,I lived a perfect life, and I all I got was this lousy big halo.
42,5,3,You can't tell by looking at me, but I used to be very fat.
38,4,0,I shouldn't have mentioned I have feelings of inadequatsey.
40,11,1,Now do you believe I'm holier than thou?
38,6,0,Yeah, the guy at the front told me they had to give me a temporary model until the new shipment comes in.
56,19,14,Your halo looks much smaller than it appeared in your profile picture.
37,7,1,That's right; everything is proportional.
38,5,0,God must have known that I was once the Hula Hoop champ of Venice Beach!
37,3,0,No, up here it’s THE standard. No one pays any attention to that trumpery about height or the size of feet, hands, adam’s apples, or noses.
43,10,4,I'm from Canada.
45,5,3,hello...or should i say halo
52,22,9,I had just finished washing the dishes, folding the laundry, and cleaning all three bathrooms when I got hit by lightning.
38,7,1,Why, yes I am the founder of Whammo. How did you know?
40,2,1,On earth I was hula-hoop champion of Boise Idaho.
37,0,0,"No- it's real; besides, that was just 20 minutes of action".
39,1,1,You were great in that - I was the lighting director.
38,5,0,Oh, I see your a naughty girl.
41,9,2,But so much for me; now tell me about you.
40,2,3,It all started with a Hula Hoop.
44,9,4,I always knew God would compensate me one day. I just didn't think it would be here.
41,5,2,If my hands weren't in my pockets you'd understand.
35,0,0,Halos were based on self-review so as a mediocre white man what did you expect.
40,0,2,My wife doesn't understand the 6 plus either
36,4,0,Honey, I swear, I was out bowling with the boys.
38,2,1,...so I said "Go ahead- as hard as you can- I dare you!
42,10,3,Actually, it's a curse.
36,3,0,I wish everyone would stop asking me if I also drove a sports car.
37,4,0,If you say "yes" I promise to get you a bigger ring.
44,8,5,Yes. It is true what they say...
37,2,0,Angelsplaining.
40,10,1,I'm a good bluffer.
33,1,0,I hope you are in to some kinky stuff.
42,11,2,It was only a dollar more to supersize it.
38,2,1,We also invented the Frisbee, no biggie, but Richard got that one...
37,3,0,Bummer, I was kinda hoping we wouldn't meet again!
40,3,2,You can say what you like, yet I believe HE decides..:
38,5,0,Sorry, but I got this as a reward for my vow of eternal chastity.
42,1,4,Yes, it is!
46,15,4,No, no, nothing like that, I'm just real happy to see you.
44,6,3,I could be really good to you too.
40,9,1,Halo. I love you. Won't you tell me your name?
44,12,3,So I said to Peter, 'I did save all the children in the fire, AND I went back for Spot.' Earthly-speaking, that didn't work out for me, but...
38,3,1,I beg to differ, angel, size does matter.
36,3,0,I've always had people say, 'Ronald, you have the most beautiful halo and the biggest we've ever seen'.
41,8,1,Turns out, humility is not a virtue.
43,11,3,Yes, how did you know I'm from Texas?
40,9,5,Sorry, sometimes I get excited too easily
39,2,1,Good start. But you must learn greater generosity in sharing your talent for romance.
41,7,2,Well, I think my holier than thou attitude is justified.
36,1,0,You just act. You don't think.
39,0,1,Mine is bigger than yours!
37,3,0,Surely, you didn't expect me to wait 10 years for you Billy?
38,3,0,Just the opposite, regrettably. They named this the "holier-than -thou" halo for a reason.
38,0,1,I guess you don't get around much.
37,2,0,Of course my halo is bigger! I earned it by putting up with you all tho
49,21,6,Yeah, it's impressive. Until you have to go into a bathroom stall.
46,13,4,Let me say this just once, and then I'll shut up forever: brake is left and gas is right.
40,2,2,You know, there is another reason they call me the Big O.
42,6,2,I lived my entire life in Texas.
39,5,0,It's not about how you use it.
38,4,0,In my former life I was the best damn hula hoop salesman west of the Mississippi.
39,2,1,Yes, I am rather proud of it.
64,31,22,I let my mother-in-law move in with us.
35,1,0,Right. But you only get to 77 percent after you've been here a while.
40,3,2,God got a good laugh. I asked for a bigger one cause my hands were so small.
42,10,1,I died in an untimely hula hoop accident.
49,11,7,Told you I was the better half.
49,10,7,I'm not acting holier-than-thou. I am.
49,18,9,That's right...you do the same amount of work but you get a smaller halo.
43,2,4,Yeah, I get to use it until one of the Kardashians shows up.
50,16,11,I finally found a use for all those unused airline miles.
41,3,3,After looking at your robe, maybe my halo shouldn't be as large as it appears.
38,4,0,Even God said mine's the biggest.
44,11,3,No dunking.
35,1,0,yes , you were late to call , but nothing beats the ring of an apple...
48,19,5,Ah, but I am holier than thou.
42,10,3,Hey, my eyes are down here. Do you think you are the first angel to stare at my halo?
37,1,0,I thought that a hula-hoop is out of fashion nowadays
36,1,1,Sorry! Just like earth, the massive halo is earned only by "the 1%".
36,3,0,Global Warming? That's nothing. We have a hole in the ozone layer here too...
36,0,0,I really thought angels don't have gender but this is too much!
35,1,0,One of the benefits of male pattern baldness.
42,6,2,So you really were a shrink in your previous life.
50,5,9,Um, actually, wing size is a better indicator.
39,6,1,Well, I wouldn't want to brag, of course, but . . . .
38,4,1,This has become a lot harder for me now that there's no such thing as real estate.
40,1,1,I'm sorry. It appears that my attitude reflected reality. I AM holier than thou.
34,1,0,I guess Janice didn't make it, I'm not surprised.
39,14,1,Are you one of Charlie's?
36,2,1,You should see my halo-hoop act. My show is Sunday afternoon. God loves it!
40,11,0,It's not the size of your halo that matters it is how you use it
36,6,0,Nice halo. Can I buy you a drink?
34,0,0,I always believed, one day, she would be president.
37,2,0,So it was Christ with K- just my luck.
37,5,0,It's really not that much of an accolade.
37,2,0,I will hire a virologist to tell you why.
40,8,1,I guess I'm just blessed.
41,6,2,What makes you think there wouldn't be a glass halo here?
42,6,2,Of course it's not just the Halo... We also get pockets.
39,11,0,Don't judge me by the size of my halo
39,4,2,"That halo will be a lot smaller when I finish with him.".
39,6,0,Trust me, I've been there and it's way too warm.
42,9,2,It's a cowboy thing
36,1,0,Mine is a bigger umbrella.
42,7,3,It was an option in my life insurance policy.
39,4,1,"Ah... I see you've been hanging out with the Kardashians again".
37,2,0,Lord knows I need a hobby, so this doubles as a hula hoop.
40,5,1,I took the prime option.
43,9,5,I only eat free-range Manna.
40,3,2,I guess you didn't 'lean in'.
36,1,0,"Hula Hoop".
48,11,7,I was shopping at Costco during the Rapture.
48,21,6,Regretfully, celibacy.
39,6,1,I cannot tell a lie. It's my hula-hoop.
46,12,6,What about coming back to my cloud and finding out for yourself?
40,0,3,I wish I lie in Heaven because yes, I am compensating.
37,0,0,Sup Angel I am willing to shrink my halo down a few notches if you know what I mean." "Yeah Ted, that is the problem with all you guys and your big halos. Nothin but a bunch of amateurs
45,7,5,Yes, it's big. But we don't have envy here in heaven.
41,3,2,You know what they say, Big halo, big . . ."
39,4,2,I wear a size 14EE. Why did you ask?
44,14,2,Ever since i went solar.
36,0,0,Divine justice -- a match made in heaven and I'm stuck at halo's length!
52,17,13,Ahem...excuse me...my eyes are down here.
38,4,1,Don't worry. I have normal size hands.
38,4,0,Unfortunately, I struck a deal with Donald . . . my alter-ego!
41,4,2,For the last two years I bet on the Warriors. How did you get here?
39,8,1,I worked in a pizza place. You?
40,2,3,I'm the guy who cancelled "19 Kids and Counting."
42,8,3,So I told Him, with the right marketing plan, we can create a huge halo effect.
38,5,0,I did well for myself, and let's just say I left an orphanage well endowed.
65,57,29,Good Samaritan? I was a GREAT Samaritan.
43,6,4,Actually, Janice, size *does* matter.
38,4,0,I promised you I would never even think about it. I guess you did?
38,4,0,My earthly profession revolved around angel hair pasta marketing
36,1,0,Sorry, I asked for dollars instead of pennies.
40,16,0,I took a bullet protecting the Pope.
37,4,0,Wow, you look great. But, if you used Halo, the shampoo that Glorifies your hair, just think...
45,16,3,Yes, I’ve been working out.
48,13,5,I got it when 'It's A Wonderful Life' grossed one billion.
43,7,3,You made it. That's what really counts.
43,7,3,...and then I joined Weight Watchers
38,1,1,No, its the Donald Trump model and it only looks like a hula hoop...
37,4,0,I am glad that you are impressed. Yes, it is real.
36,5,0,Does my "holier than thou" attitude make sense to you now?
36,2,0,Cynthia, will you merry me to love each other till death us ...hmm: what is it up here?
38,2,1,It's not the size of the halo that counts!
41,5,2,Well yes, I did invent the Hula Hoop. How did you guess?
48,15,6,We've recently developed a plan to reduce the gender halo gap gradually over the next five centuries.
39,8,1,There's no envy up here.
38,3,1,So, do you use Tinder often?
39,5,1,Stand back honey, I don't know how big this thing gets.
38,7,0,Some are just more holy.
39,7,0,Honestly, it's a double edged sword. The 5G halo is great for sending messages to the world but its bulk is a nuisance when your executing judgements
44,16,7,You have no idea how much pressure it puts on me.
36,4,0,Trust me; it's not what you think.
42,8,1,So yeah... it stretches when you use it as a frisbee.
35,4,0,I know same angel rank, different halo size, but trust me progress has been made in the last few millennia.
47,12,5,I supported Bernie. Of course, I'm holier than thou.
55,20,12,Yea, I know! The worst one I've been called is "Sir Cumference".
43,11,2,Yeah, it's the Stetson of halos.
36,0,0,I hear it's directly proportional to the amount of times you posted about social justice on Facebook." "Really? I thought it was about ego.
54,32,13,A disappointing reward for a life of abstinence.
37,2,0,I'm Sid Colgate and it's the original ring of confidence, so pucker up baby - minty heaven!
43,9,4,What gender gap?
38,1,1,Is it actually you, ZEUS!!! Oh my god I am the biggest fan can o have your autograph. Uh I have no hands.
41,11,2,Well, I don't want to sound holier than thou...
36,0,0,I don't think that will get you any perks from the Boss.
48,7,8,I'm very very good.
44,7,5,According to God, size actually does matter.
39,3,1,It was that weekend in Las Vegas, wasn't it.
41,11,2,I do not have a holier-than-thou attitude.
41,9,2,Howdy,Miss......They call me Tex.
37,2,0,You may appear with a wider field but females live longer.
40,1,2,Cut it out. Size doesn't matter here.
38,8,1,I told you to wear your seatbelt.
40,3,3,Well, yeah, baby, I did drive a fancy sportscar when I was alive. How did you know?

36,5,0,You know what they say about large rings...
36,1,0,I should not brag but the bigger the halo., the bigger the...what was it called again?
36,1,0,They ran out of stock and had to improvise with a hula-hoop.
36,1,0,Your halo is smaller because you choose to spend more time with your family...
39,2,1,*Swipe left*

42,9,2,Well...for some of us abstinence was more challenging.
38,2,1,I'm not sure if it's an extra-wide halo, or a portal about to suck me up.
43,7,4,Honestly, I’m not one to let size go to my head.
47,11,7,Heavenlywear@Narcissus.com, why?

41,6,1,I'm suddenly kinda bummed by this non-corporeal existence thing.
45,16,4,Nope, never even removed a mattress tag.

51,14,12,You bet this is incredible; I was a lawyer!
47,7,4,Obviously I am holier than thou!
41,8,2,There's a wage gap up here too.
37,5,0,I don't mean to brag, but size does matter up here.
47,21,5,Why yes, as a matter of fact, I am from Texas.
40,4,1,How's about I trade you my halo for that dress?
40,5,1,"Could you really help me shrink my halo? How?

49,13,9,It's been over four hours, I better go call my doctor.
40,5,1,I know you usually go for more of the "bad boy type," but I think we'd be a match made in heaven.
36,0,0,Damn, I've lost my halo through the portal again.
39,9,1,Unfortunately, it's an inverse relationship.

40,13,1,Sure, the upgrade was so expensive I had to take out a loan, but I literally have an eternity to pay it back.
41,5,2,My halo's not the only thing that's oversized.
45,6,5,So, do you come up here often?
37,0,0,It's the only was I've found to overcompensate up here.

36,2,0,I've been spending some time lately under halogen lamps
37,0,1,As for my missing rib, dear Eve, up here all is forgiven.
41,16,2,In my day I walked 128,234 little old ladies across the street, rescued 34,627 cats from trees, helped.....
38,4,0,Wait, hold on! You were my great-grandmother?
37,3,0,Compensating for something?
37,4,0,Yes, it's a manly halo.
36,0,0,I never cheated in the hula hoop marathon.
35,1,0,You know what they say about gaping halos, right?
46,15,5,If this lasts longer than 4 hours, we should call someone.
41,16,1,I suppose you could say I'm holier than thou.
35,1,0,You only get the big ones when your really really good!
42,16,3,It's rude to stare, you know.
38,0,4,"I had to run through hoops to get here"!
42,6,3,It's not a sin to overcompensate.
36,2,0,"No, I'm afraid I didn't have a clue that you were always hot for me".
44,9,3,You know what they say, "big halo, big hands."
49,16,7,I was canonized for inventing the hula hoop.
35,2,0,You know what they say you can tell from the size of a man's halo? Well, don't mention it up here, or we'll spend eternity screaming in a lake of fire.
46,15,4,Because I AM holier than thou.
37,4,0,Yes, it is true what they say about the size of a man's halo.
38,4,0,It's 'Holier Than Thou'. Politicians love 'em.
36,1,1,It's in a state of arousal
36,1,0,That's the strangest hat I've ever seen.
37,2,0,It's the robe. It's actually an optical illusion... Don't act like you're not impressed!
53,11,9,I used to make pizzas
47,12,5,No, it is the pothole I fell through and ended up here.
54,14,14,Why, yes! I AM happy to see you ...
38,3,0,Oh St. Peter's gay, alright--he was definitely flirting with me. Just take one look at this ridiculous halo I got. I heard from Linda that's why they make him stand outside the gates.
42,5,3,Congratulations! You've made it through one more glass ceiling.
37,5,0,Well, what did you expect?
40,6,1,Well you know what they say about a man's "halo".
40,8,3,I supported Bernie.
36,4,0,I was in a hula hoop accident.
38,2,0,You know what they say about the size of a man angel's halo . . .
40,6,1,My halo's not fat...he just has a thyroid issue.
45,12,4,But, of course, I'm holier than thou.
38,8,1,Wham-o just took over halo production.
42,5,4,The boss says I'm easier to keep an eye on this way.
36,4,1,I took the A-Rod route...
36,6,0,It's all that's left of male chauvinism.
40,12,0,I got in through a loophole.
40,5,2,Is that a pizza on your head or are you just glad to see me?
36,0,0,... and that's why I'm pro-life.
37,1,0,Whomever said, bigger isn't better, had no clue what they were talking about!
43,13,3,'Hot' is a tricky term here.
39,1,2,Mama insisted that they give me the biggest halo.
46,13,6,I'm just that good.
41,7,1,I actually brought it with me. It was my favorite dollar store hula hoop.
43,2,5,Wait'll you see my hands.
40,9,1,My mother was Goody Two-Shoes and my father was Dudley Do-Right. Why do you ask?
34,1,0,The size of your halo correlates to the abundance of your emotion being felt at that precise moment.
42,11,2,No, Honestly! I really was the guy who invented the Hula Hoop!
38,4,0,I'm not REALLY holier than thou, gorgeous.
36,2,0,'R' is reverse and 'D' is drive. There, I've said it. Now give me a kiss.
39,5,1,I left my harddrive on the cloud.
35,3,0,Lucky you! You have a smaller halo to carry!
37,3,0,I'm guessing your a Virgo
40,2,2,Will you marry me again?
40,4,1,I'm telling you the truth!
37,3,0,I crossed over with High Honesty
39,2,1,Yes, I do support Trump for President
44,11,4,I built mother-in-law suites for a living.
40,10,1,Your halo would bigger if you didn't offer me that apple.
37,4,0,I'm sorry, but this is still not a gender free environment.
45,15,4,Costco. Why, where did you get yours?
40,5,1,Size matters forever.
36,2,0," I thought you said size doesn't matter! " Bridgebody.squarespace.com
40,3,2,It matches my hands
43,11,3,Size will always matter.
38,7,1,Still not convinced my denomination was right?
36,1,0,Don't tempt me...I wat to keep my big halo!
37,0,0,looks like a transgender halo to me dear
41,10,1,I call it the Hula Halo
38,6,0,I see now it's possible to be too good.
40,7,1,There are no rules, you just wing it.
37,2,0,My name is Johnny Angel.
38,4,0,It is amazing how many people still don't believe in the gender pay gap.
41,3,3,I was a really good hula hooper.
38,6,0,I got in off the waiting list. You must have been Early Decision.
39,1,1,You were right, Bigger isn't always better-A W K W A R D !
49,8,7,It's all true.
35,3,0,It kink of grows on you.
39,2,2,IT'S much more reliable than hand size.
43,8,4,Yes, there is a gender-gap in the standard compensation for good works.
39,4,2,They will say this is a match made in heaven.
44,8,4,I summer on cloud ten.
38,3,1,Yeah, well you know how it is. Some girls just go a little overboard with the ratings.
38,2,1,He: I guess I should've listened to you and taken the left turn. She: Told you so.
42,9,2,I've always felt a little holier than thou.
42,5,3,Not really .... I used to work in a pizzeria.
44,9,3,Truthfully, really: Does size matter?
38,4,0,It's not all about size- its how you use it.
40,8,2,Super-sized it with my Golden Gate Rewards card.
40,5,1,Am I in the right place?
41,9,1,Not really. I just died at the height of the hula hoop craze.
40,7,1,Yeah, it's huge...why?
42,9,3,And when I get bored, I use it as a hula hoop.
37,6,1,No, smarty pants, I am NOT trying to compensate for any of my earthly shortcomings.
38,2,1,Well, it's not Trump huge, but...
35,1,0,You mean halo size and virtue are NOT correlated?
48,11,8,I never forgot anniversaries, always took the garbage out and consistently put toilet seats down.
38,6,1,I was perfect at hula hoop, too.
42,9,2,As you can see, size does matter.
42,13,2,I died a virgin.
42,10,3,I'm the patron saint of hula hoopers.
37,2,0,Wingsplaining.
47,11,6,Yes it means exactly what you're thinking.
42,12,3,Halo Envy
45,7,4,I invented the "Halo Extender, For Men," it usually lasts about five hours.
44,9,5,Holiness? No, they measure sales.
36,4,0,Now do you believe that men are superior?
38,6,0,Well my halo is enormously large, so I got that going for me!
35,2,0,It's actually a portal to a higher level ... so good luck.
39,5,1,Well "halo," good looking.
38,4,0,Peter, darling, my aureole is up here.
44,10,3,Yeah, seems we've been working on this Halo Equity Gap for, like, eternity
33,1,0,The Big Guy is amused by this phenomenon. He says He's going to try too somehow work it into the new "humans" He's creating.
43,8,3,Just patented it, the Halo Hoop
35,8,1,I said hula, not halo
46,6,6,Does this robe make my halo look big?
40,9,1,You'te gonna need a bigger halo.
38,4,0,It's not the size but what you do with it that matters.
40,6,1,Trade ya.
36,3,0,You see, they correlate your halo size to the size of your ego.
38,2,0,In regards to my aura, would you consider a pre-nup?
39,5,1,Without a doubt, I'm holier than you.
41,3,2,How did I do it? Clean thinking and no meat on Fridays. That's really it.
37,1,1,I did succumb to the weaknesses of the flesh, but, I guess God cut me some slack for all my contributions to the church. To be perfectly honest, I would jump your bones right now, but I'm without funds for further contributions.
44,11,4,I paid for premium.
37,3,1,Well I happen to feel that the deluxe package was not a rip-off.
50,9,8,Sorry, this is Judeo-Christian Biblical Heaven, so you will be doing most of the work and receiving a fraction of the credit and pay...
39,3,1,I'm sorry. I was on my way to a rehearsal of "Angels in America," and fell through a pothole.
37,2,1,Yes, I did sleep with a lot of angels.
37,3,0,My "holier than thou" attitude is easily explained.
38,9,0,They were out of my size.
37,3,1,Not to be halo-ey er than thou, but...
39,2,2,It's true what they say about men with big halos.
43,14,3,Yeah, they come standard when you buy a Prius.
38,2,1,Gotta say, your smile and youthful figure - together with the cute, LITTLE halo - has been much anticipated.
40,4,1,Never. Have. Kids.
42,12,3,They were all out of Men's Medium.
35,4,0,I'm just working with what god have me.
39,4,1,My halo is larger because I remained a virgin longer
40,8,1,It helps my night vision.
40,7,1,E.otherworldly says we're a match made in heaven!
39,4,2,Well, you know what they say about the size of a man's halo.
39,7,0,It s not the size that matters, it matters how you use it.
43,6,3,They're naming some new saints, and I may toss my halo in the ring.
41,10,1,they give the big halo to the greeter
37,1,1,Pardon my extension.
39,4,1,Well, in life I came across as a bit holier-than-thou. I'm not sure if this is vindication or payback.
36,5,0,You know it's true about big halos ...
36,1,0,I would love to stay and chat, but there are 49 beautiful souls that need me right now.
42,14,1,It will be the same size as yours when the Viagra wears off.
37,0,2,Size matters, particularly in heaven.
36,6,0,I also have Huuge hands
39,2,2,What's a bimbo like you doing in a place like this?
38,5,2,You excite me, Monica--even here of all places.
46,6,6,So, when all is said and done, size DOES matter
37,3,2,I guess it's a man's heaven.
36,3,0,Size matters, Evermore
47,10,5,As I suspected. Women get haloes, men get hula hoops.
38,2,1,I let my dad move in with me when Mom died.
39,2,1,Yes, even here size matters.
36,0,0,I moved to Westchester for this?
50,22,9,It means I'm happy to see you!
44,12,5,It feels a little mid-afterlife crisis, huh?
49,9,8,Remember me? I was your first husband!
37,4,1,Like I said, some men are just bigger than others...
42,6,2,I'm compensating.
42,9,3,The platinum package also included extra wings and an after-lifetime guarantee.
38,2,2,And I have REALLY big hands.
37,1,1,The big halo is about to shrink!
36,2,1,I'm glad you swiped up
49,10,9,If it stays like this another three hours I have to see a doctor.
38,4,1,You heard what they say about people with large halos?
44,8,4,It helps with my poor self-esteem.
49,9,7,I saw Hamilton and didn't mention it to anyone.
38,12,0,Call me. I'm around.
45,16,3,If it were just a vanity thing, I wouldn't be here
50,17,8,I guess I'm just Holier than Thou...
48,18,6,I'm to seek immediate divine intervention if it lasts more than four hours. . . .
37,3,0,It's not my attitude. I was a big fundaiser for the Clinton's and Obama.
35,0,0,You know what they say about haloes...
45,9,5,You're still gonna swipe left, aren't you?
48,12,6,Makes it Hell to walk through a doorway.
39,3,3,Hello, My Name Is Pinocchio.
38,6,0,But honey, I got it for half-price at the big & tall section in heaven.
38,5,1,You know what they say about giant halos ...
40,5,2,Fortunately, up here, size does matter.
39,2,1,… umm, er, and, ultimately, size does…” “OMG! I’m in the other place!
36,0,0,Want to fly over to the next cloud for a milkshake?
38,2,0,I know you've seen a lot of these, but never one as big as this.
42,9,2,I just am holier than thou.
38,5,1,Yes it's big, but do you know how to use it?
37,2,0,It must have been my Low T
38,2,1,Down on earth I was a swing state super delegate.
39,6,1,I've got a very big halo, that I can tell you. As far as other things, I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee it.
41,3,2,I got it at Ross
36,6,1,My halo also serves as my umbrella.
43,6,4,It's sad that so many exaggerate their true halo size on e-Heaven, don't you think?
46,9,7,And my golden chalice comes with unlimited refills.
36,2,0,In heaven, you see, we get to keep our favorite girl, trade in our orange hair, forget all the stupid things we ever said, and still be on top.
35,0,0,This way, it's better for hula-hooping.
45,12,7,Well, I guess we know who's 'holier than thou'!
39,2,2,First, let's talk about our future.
43,7,3,By the time they got to me, all they had left were Hula Hoops.
39,9,1,You're affecting my halo, you know.
36,1,0,What do you mean, "Why are my hands in my pockets?" Can't you see how big my halo is?
36,0,0,My hole in the sky gives me more mobility
40,5,2,I had heard that size does matter.
43,17,2,I was told I had an eternity to grow into it.
34,1,0,My feet aren't the only thing that is proportionally bigger.
34,6,0,I have a big one.
41,10,1,Where have you been all my life?
49,9,9,I can still hear her yelling, "It's been more than five hours. Call the doctor."
40,7,1,I was getting too close to certain angels.
42,1,4,I was a lot heavier down there.
39,7,2,It only gets this big when I see you!
39,4,1,Please don't hate me because I have a bigger halo.
35,1,0,Hillary and Donald for President, for sure!
39,3,1,It's God's compensation for being born with a small penis.
36,3,0,It seems to have a brain of it's own.
38,4,0,Where'd you get those great wings?
45,10,4,It makes my shorter wings less noticeable.
41,5,2,Don't give me that look, but yes, it is true what they say about Angels with Big Halos.....
38,3,1,Are you trying to compensate for something
39,4,2,Well, you know what they say about guys with big halos?
44,7,3,You know what they say about men's halos ?
43,5,4,It lasted more than four hours!
42,10,3,You wouldn't believe the number of candles I lit.
43,16,4,I call it a halo hoop.
38,4,0,I'm afraid there's a glass ceiling up here too,, did they tell you that?
37,4,0,Really? I think you need to get back down to earth about your size.
37,3,0,A glass what?
38,7,1,Remember when you told me to tip ten percent but I did fifteen?
41,8,2,They're calling it the Halo Hoop.
38,7,0,I've got to be honest: bigger isn't necessarily better.
45,7,4,I am a little tongue tied: it's been 560 years since I asked a girl out on a date...
37,2,1,The other angels are saying we were paired together because you need to pay for previous sins.
36,4,0,I can show you how to use the wings...
37,3,0,How we got pizza.
36,0,0,You told me that He liked a bigger halo, but he said that its good that my head was big enough to fit into it.
37,3,1,If I may humbly say, I'm the guy best equipped for lighting up your afterlife.
45,13,5,I met my target weight, but I still have all this excess halo.
37,3,0,Does this mean I'm going to hell?
37,2,0,They say size doesn't matter, but I say it does.
40,5,1,It was either Hell or the size of the hole I created in the ozone layer.
36,2,0,I pray it won't fade away, ahooo, ahooo.
48,11,7,Unfortunately size no longer matters.
42,8,2,It appear you were right about one thing. I am really am holier than thou.
38,4,0,It reflects my holier-than-thou W.A.S.P. ego.
45,4,5,Yes, what you're thinking is true and that's one of the reason this place is called heaven.
41,2,2,It's not a halo. By the way, have you seen my fire pole?
43,9,3,I invented the Hula Hoop. How about you?
39,6,1,Yes, I must humbly admit, it is unusually large.
39,4,1,Your Halo might be too big for your head, but I really think your cute.
38,5,0,Look, I'm not trying to be holier than thou...
41,6,1,But mine is platinum.
46,11,4,I got it for my humility.
36,1,1,Just say no.
38,3,1,I grew one shop into a national chain of pizzerias . . .
39,3,1,So, yeah, I don't believe in the so-called Mid Afterlife Crisis... How about you?
36,4,0,Make Heaven great again!
41,9,4,I always knew I was holier than thou
42,9,3,Believe me, I'm no angel. I just fell through a open manhole!
37,7,0,Yeah, it makes up not being able to see one's feet.
37,3,1,I am indeed blessed... big halo... big hands... big... well ... virtue keeps me from sayin'
40,2,1,Yes, it's true what they say about angels with big halos but the irony is you only get one by not giving in to temptation.
38,4,1,As the woman said to the gynecologist, "I'm dilated to meet you!"
43,4,4,It's from sucking up to the boss. You thought you were done with that, huh?
35,1,0,You got bad directions. The Victoria's Secret fashion show is shooting in Studio A.
35,4,0,It's just that I've been 'around' more than you. Get it?
37,5,0,And you know what they say about the size of the halo.
47,13,6,I gave to PBS.
38,9,0,Sure, the accolade is nice, but just try getting through a door with this thing.
38,2,0,It's not that I'm holier than thou, it's just that size does matter.
38,3,1,I tried to trade it in for a smaller one, but they said I'd have to -- uh -- 'see' you first.
37,5,0,Even for angels, size doesn't matter my friend
42,16,1,And you thought earning 77 cents for every dollar on earth wasn't fair.
40,7,1,My answer is still the same one I gave you in high school.
40,9,1,All I said was, "Super-size me!"
38,4,1,Halo 6 is still in beta.
40,5,2,St. Peter ran our of halos, but he had some hula hoops left over from the sixties.
37,2,0,I am sorry that it turns out god is a man.
37,4,0,I was actually getting ready to dump you right before the accident.
53,28,12,I liked God on Facebook.
38,4,1,Your 'holier-than-thou' attitude is comically inappropriate right now.
38,8,0,Dry-clean only.
36,2,2,I was overjoyed when I first learned I could bring my hula-hoop, now not so much.
42,3,3,It's this big because I'm so humble.
36,0,0,It's not the size of the halo, it's how you use it that counts. However, mine is Yuuuuge.
37,2,0,My mystic chord swells surely as you touch the better angel of my nature.
37,4,0,My halo's bigger than yours.
36,9,2,Yours was way larger before last night
42,7,2,Yeah! That's what she said.
39,3,1,No, I hadn't heard that God lost his halo.
38,6,0,How do you like my new Halo-hoop?
37,0,1,That's not even 79%
43,10,3,Quite right. Holier than thou.
37,2,1,I got here in the late '50s. It's a hula hoop, actually.
44,9,4,Actually, I have very large hands, too.
37,5,1,It's Heaven's equivalent of a 'Dunce' cap.
36,3,0,I had a head start
38,2,1,I know that size is not supposed to matter but...
39,5,2,If it doesn't go back to normal in four hours call a doctor.
37,2,1,They say size doesn't matter.
39,6,2,I'd rather be lucky than good.
46,6,6,It’s the biggest, greatest, most-terrific halo heaven has ever seen—that I can tell you—because God loves me—really, everybody loves me, it’s terrific, everyone loves me, but mostly God loves me—it’s incredible…
42,9,2,I used to do rodeo rope tricks. It takes pracice.
41,4,2,I guess they never discovered the SEC Indictment
36,2,0,It's not an invisible ceiling that will prevent you from rising in the angelic ranks; it merely indicates that yours is a more focused spirituality.
39,1,2,hahahahaha even in death, mine is still bigger than yours.
39,2,1,And he referred to my hands: if they're small-- something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem.
42,5,3,Did u fall from heaven? Because... wait never mind.
41,9,1,I have room for two.
38,6,0,I know we said 'till death do us part' but I was thinking that we could go a little longer
39,4,1,I think you've got a bit of a swelled head
40,1,1,I biggie sized it.
37,0,0,Check out my custom made 20 inch cast aluminum halo wheel.
41,8,2,It's called a hula halo.
41,12,2,I know there are differences, but we can work it out.
37,2,0,Bad Tinder Dates in Heaven: "Its not the only reason they call me Big O."
53,21,14,I won the cartoon caption contest.
38,7,0,If this angel stuff doesn't work out, I could always light my halo on fire and join the circus...
42,11,2,Why yes, I do have a very large harp.
39,6,1,I'm on Weight Watchers.
41,9,1,You don't happen to have any polish I can borrow?
36,5,0,It matches the size of my....er, hands.
37,1,1,So I said, "Easy, Pinky Ring. It's not a competition."
37,1,1,Halo hula hoop tonight, desire for eternity.
49,15,7,I've lost 400 pounds.
37,5,1,No, seriously, you look like an angel sent from Heaven!
40,6,1,It tarnishes easily.
44,17,3,Because God is a guy.
40,6,1,I remember you, you had a big head when you were our manager!
39,4,0,Yeah, I guess you could call it a holey roller.
35,8,1,They were low on halos; it's a hula hoop.
40,11,2,It's not a halo it's an exit.
42,9,2,I got the assault weapons ban reinstated.
34,1,0,“Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light? Or just another lost angel... City of Night? ” ? Jim Morrison
36,13,0,Good heavens. You barely made it!
41,11,4,It's a much better predictor than hand size. . . .
45,14,4,Sure the reception's slightly better, but I wish I thought twice before springing for the latest upgrade.
35,2,0,You have to wait at least 10 years before you increase your gauge. If you get a blowout, you're outta here.
36,5,0,If He knows we're friends, He'll invite you to lunch.
47,9,5,Is a safe word really a necessity?
45,12,5,What do you mean, 'is that a cumulonimbus cloud or are you happy to see me?'
39,1,1,Frank! Is that YOU?
38,2,1,Mine is an affect
45,10,4,I found the slim-fit uncomfortable.
39,15,0,The size of my halo slows me down, but I do get better service.
45,7,5,Yes, you had to put with me your whole life, but I had to put up with your mother.
41,11,1,Depends what you mean by "gifted"
51,22,8,You know what they say about a man and the size of his halo...
37,5,1,I sinned less, that's why I have a bigger one.
23,5,0,I bought it online
39,6,1,I was famous for my ten-gallon hats.
39,2,1,Size still matters
37,2,0,hey bro
39,4,1,I knew angels were real when I met you.
40,3,2,I'm not saying I'm "Holier than thou," I just think my idea is better.
45,7,5,Who's "holier than thou" now?
38,2,1,My halo says hello to you
39,3,1,So they took it metaphorically when fitting the halo to the size of your head?
51,9,8,If you think this is bad, you should see Gandhi's.
39,5,1,Look, up here, the halo is only related to the size of your ego!
40,9,2,You're really going to blame me for the halo? I died--that's all I did. I did not ask for one THIS big. Oh, come on, don't give me that look.
42,10,3,I left a big tip at the Gates...
42,14,2,You're busy for the next million weekends?
41,15,1,Just one of several hoops I had to jump through to get here.
38,2,1,No, it's actually not that, rather I was the national president of the Chubby Checker Fan Club.
42,8,3,Classic situational irony: You like bad boys.
50,13,10,I died in a hula hoop accident. God thinks this is funny!
36,0,0,It's the score. And yes, like in golf.
37,3,0,I spent my whole life dreaming of you.
39,4,1,I don't think I belong here, it's a hula hoop.
41,6,1,It's a rental. Sometimes, I need to feel Godly.
39,3,1,I got bored and they gave me a hula hoop.
41,5,2,Oh, size matters, baby!
38,9,0,The temptation to correlate is infinite.
40,7,1,It's a side effect of the Viagra.
36,7,0,I'm confess, this whole heaven and angel thing is still over my head.
44,9,4,I'm afraid we don't count "Victoria's Secret" as previous experience.
35,1,0,Soooo, I see your halo matches your size.
36,1,0,Men never pay attention. I told my husband John, I said John dear, we need new wheels for the baby's stroller.
40,9,3,I'm pretty sure that size does matter up here...
42,8,3,To paraphrase George Orwell, "All angels are created equal, but some are more equal than others."
36,1,0,I got it in Williamsburg.
43,8,2,I am not compensating.
40,0,2,Well, you know guys have a tendency to over-exaggerate...
43,2,4,I want a divorce.
37,0,1,You’re in heaven. Of course I also have big hands.
37,4,0,Trust me on this: Size matters.
37,4,1,Yes, even in heaven size matters.
38,5,1,You look almost devilish today.
41,10,0,It came as a free upgrade on my last flight!
39,1,1,Compensating much?
38,2,0,Like I said before, we were on a break.
40,2,2,Is it too late to say I should have married you?
45,13,5,Seriously, is He playing ring-toss, again?
41,7,2,You probably think I'm compensating, but this halo is purely functional.
39,7,1,It's a little known verse - blessed is the bling.
39,3,1,Well, you know what they say around here, 'Big hands, big halo.'
36,4,0,I've got big hands and big feet as well. But who's measuring?
51,25,8,I used to think I deserved it, but now it's just ironic.
39,3,1,I have a little down time while I'm uploading.
38,3,1,What are you doing for the next six hours?
41,11,1,Overcompensating is no sin.
45,6,5,Apparently size does matter.
37,2,1,My hands are large, too.
47,9,6,I'm His press secretary.
38,2,0,I could use your grandiose halo as a hula hoop!
45,17,4,So, you're a conservative.
43,8,5,I opted for the wider radius option. It covers a multitude of sins.
37,0,0,Just remember mines a halo yours is a hoopla hoop!!!!!!!
42,9,2,It gets in my way at the drinking fountain
46,7,5,I died in a freak Hoola Hoop accident.
39,2,3,I washed it in cold water
43,13,2,Don't be silly, of course I'm not holier than YOU.
37,2,0,My therapist says I have a small penis.
40,8,1,I do not judge people by the size of their halo.
47,6,6,Of course this is what I meant when I said said that size matters!
39,3,1,Don't let it go to your head. We needed some eye candy.
40,17,1,I know, and the robe is too big too!
38,3,1,I swear to God it only gets smaller if I lie
40,5,2,Oh, this is not politically correct
38,3,1,They say size doesn't matter, but...
41,4,2,Eve, she meant nothing to me.
41,5,2,It's a complete myth that men overcompensate when they feel their masculinity is threatened.
40,11,3,What do you mean size doesn't matter?
38,5,0,Halo....size matters up here
39,3,1,I wonder if he will notice one of Saturns rings is missing .
60,13,18,I got God tickets to "Hamilton".
41,9,2,It's a rental, mine is in the shop.
41,11,2,Are you telling me size doesn’t matter here?
43,8,3,I can't help it, I'm just really good.
43,5,3,Yeah, doll, even up here there's a glass ceiling.
38,5,1,Compensating?! No no, I was an ego maniac
46,11,5,O.K.—I am just happy to see you.
34,2,1,It's the holier-than-thou halo.
43,10,3,Mine is actually a hula hoop.
42,3,2,It doesn't quite fit into my Maserati, but I make do.
48,19,5,Actually, I used my miles to get the upgrade.
36,0,0,I've been told that size matters.
40,6,1,I believe the circumference of one's halo is proportional to one's holiness.
38,6,1,I really am a bad boy, I swear. Well, I would never swear, but...
39,3,2,Wish I could , but I am scheduled to be rightsized in about 20 minutes.
36,0,0,Forget what St. Paul said -- Allah il Allah il Allah.
40,5,1,Is that a halo or a hole in the ceiling?
38,6,0,Honest ... it's nothing like Pinocchio's nose.
40,5,1,My name is Trump.
37,9,1,I was always the favorite child.
38,6,0,And you know what they say about guys with big halos.
39,7,1,Wow. You must have been really good, huh?
49,23,6,The swelling's supposed to go down in a couple of days.
45,7,6,Apparently size matters up here too.
41,3,2,I haven't slept a wink since I had this one installed. It's like an alien beacon up there.
43,9,3,How long did it take you to graduate from your safety halo?
39,5,1,Don't give me that look just because I have a swelled halo.
45,14,3,When it comes to halo size, I assure you, I have no problems in that area.
41,5,2,No, I'm not holier than thou. I got this so I can use it as a hula hoop.
40,3,2,Soon you will have a big enough head to fit that Halo.
36,1,1,Finally, some special treatment for professional hula-hoopers.
38,6,0,I hope you like a man with a bigger than average halo.
43,8,4,It turns out they're real sticklers about "ten items or less."
37,2,0,I was the hula hoop champion in graduate school!
34,6,0,What are you talking about? There's no halo gender gap.
41,8,1,Every time I say size doesn't matter, it gets bigger.
57,21,15,I took out the trash AND made the bed.
39,3,1,Is that a hula hoop?
42,12,2,They promised more radiance, but all I get is curious looks
38,7,1,Do you even tithe?
37,4,0,I'm impressed.
44,18,3,Who do I call for holiness lasting longer than 4 hours?
36,3,1,So I told God; you either make me an Archangel or I tell Satan about you making sure Hillary won.
42,6,4,If my halo lasts longer than four hours, will you marry me?
39,11,1,Hula Hoop Champion.
37,9,0,No, I just loved to hula-hoop.
61,27,22,It's not funny. I've been dunked on twice today.
38,7,1,I typed 'AMEN' in the comments.
38,8,0,Yeah, what they say about guys with large halos is true.
39,8,1,I'm having it resized. I've lossed so much weight.
37,7,1,I know I seem too good to be true, but....
42,5,3,Don't give me that 'holier than thou' look again.
46,6,7,No, it's just a Hula-Hoop.
40,11,1,No sweat! Getting here is the important thing.
42,6,2,Perhaps you should have been more diplomatic in the confessional.
40,4,1,I have to admit, I hang with the best of them.
38,4,1,"I don't understand why everyone calls me hoola-hoop head".
39,8,1,Touch it, it's real.
41,3,2,Shit! I coulda had more fun!
39,2,1,Angel...shmangel...he's really full of himself.
38,3,1,You know what they say about men with large halos.
41,9,2,It's embarrassing, but when I see the Angel of my Dreams....
39,3,1,See honey I told you they were not the kind of mushrooms you eat
42,6,2,So you see I was right in my "Holier Than Thou" attitude.
43,6,3,Celibacy is a vastly overrated virtue.
37,3,0,It combines Pilates and Hoola-hooping for a whole new holistic approach to fitness.
39,7,0,Be honest. Does it make me look phat?
42,12,1,They only had XL's in stock.
45,9,5,I'm still a virgin
40,5,1,Actually the halo size shows your Heaven age, it's like a tree!
38,1,0,jrjrjr
41,15,1,I always put the shopping cart in the corral.
38,0,2,After all, YOU betrayed him some 150,000 years ago.
46,12,5,The doctor said it's benign.
38,4,0,I have a degree from Trump U.
40,4,2,When I look at you, I get... larger than life!
37,3,1,Apparently the glass ceiling is opening up.
36,1,0,I'm reaall good in the sack...
36,3,0,All the abstaining I did down there and all I get is a little halo envy up here.
54,9,11,Up here size does matter.
37,2,1,It's that old glass ceiling thing. Even up here.
43,7,4,What they say is true; big halo, .....
42,10,1,You were right. I really am a "Holier than thou guy."
41,5,2,I understand that Size Matters here, too
38,7,0,It's called a 'Morning Glory.'
40,14,0,'The devil's in the details."
38,0,3,Apparently once a month they have "Bad Judgment Day."
37,0,1,In the other life, my thinking was cloudy.
35,1,0,My skylight is bigger than your skylight
36,2,0,Yah Gods my wing-angel
41,14,1,My head has shrunk considerably since I arrived here.
36,3,0,Is that you, Caitlyn?
36,3,0,Hey, Baby, Would you please help me to shrink my halo?
42,13,1,This is my fat halo.
42,3,4,That’s just a recognition of my impressive humility.
39,3,1,I guess size matters up here too.
43,11,3,No. This time, it's because I'm happy to see you.
38,6,0,I'll have you know, he's the only candidate who can make heaven great again; that's why he's getting my vote.
40,2,1,Oh, that was heavenly.
49,14,7,I worked in a pizzeria
47,12,5,That's right, darlin'. You have died and gone to heaven...!
38,5,0,I like the new rating system, but it does decrease the number of angels that can dance on the point of a pin.
43,6,2,I do most of my work in Texas.
39,7,1,It's the only size Amazon had left.
37,3,0,Where am I from? Orlando.
44,9,5,This size came with the wings and a bag of chips.
39,8,0,Let's go ask Archimedes. I'll bet he'll have the answer!
45,4,6,Because I'm holier-than-thou.
38,6,0,My mother said it would stay like that if I kept playing with it.
41,14,2,Nothing fits right after you lose weight.
39,8,0,In another world and in another time, yes size would matter.
35,1,1,I figure God gave me the extra buoyancy so I don't fall again.
39,5,0,Pinocchio and I react slightly differently...
40,6,1,Excuse me. Would you say this is fostering an excessive sense of entitlement?
42,3,3,I also use it as a hula-hoop.
36,4,0,'The halos are on back order, but I got this hula hoop same-day delivery on Amazon.'
37,6,0,I wouldn't say I was especially blessed , but maybe...
41,5,3,Well, I'm a Bernie supporter
35,1,0,My financial adviser had me consolidate my accounts.
38,3,1,No less is more is a fallacy
47,10,6,Yeah, but I still miss my Ferrari.
39,7,0,True, I was a virgin.
39,6,1,So size does matter?
37,2,1,It's like big hands.
38,4,1,Um, no. Pinocchio lives on a different cloud.
40,5,1,It's a NextGen Halo that doubles as a mood ring.
36,3,0,Yea...you can say I lost a few ring sizes, the angels haven't resized my halo yet though.
36,0,0,...hope he can't read my mind. "Oh honey! Our glorious reunion at last!" ....If I had even a CLUE he would be here, I would have lived longer or at least been a really bad girl...
44,2,4,Does a small hallo mean what I think it means ?
38,4,0,Well, since you asked, I was a champion hula-hooper.
37,3,0,I know. You know who we are. I'm gay. God's punishment. Right.
43,7,3,What can I say, babe? I really am holier than thou.
35,2,0,....you see it's all in proportion.....
46,11,5,How about we get together and try to make a bullseye?
44,7,2,You know what they say -- "the bigger the halo..."
42,14,2,Unfortunately it is really heavy.
43,5,3,I was a late bloomer.
49,12,7,I listened to a woman--like, really listened--and didn't try to sleep with her.
43,4,3,That's the problem, you think bigger is always better.
40,5,1,Excuse me woman.. is that a frisbee on your head?
36,2,0,I won it in a prayer card game.
41,4,2,Yeah, New Yorkers hate when I call this place "Los Angeles."
37,2,0,Your halo looks a little too big for you to be an angel.
39,3,2,I promise. I won't let it go to my head.
40,5,2,Yes, it's true what they say about a one's halo size...
45,12,4,We are equal, but I'm more equal.
41,9,2,The halos were on back order, so I used my daughter's hula hoop.
44,10,3,What are you talking about? If anything, I'm UNDER compensating.
45,8,1,See, even in Heaven: "Size does matter."
35,3,0,You can use my hulu hoop until your halo arrives.
46,10,5,It's nothing special; just a bigger hole in the ozone layer.
35,5,0,Did I mention there's a Hula competition up here?
36,0,1,You can"t hula hoop with that size.
37,7,0,I don't like to rush into things, as you can see.
40,3,2,I never thought I'd die to regret inventing the hula hoop.
37,4,0,I know, i know. It was just too easy.
42,9,2,Yes, I did pay a bit more for this one.
37,2,1,So you really didn't spend that weekend at Aunt Gloria's?
43,10,3,I never took home a single office supply.
35,3,0,Well, one day God strolled by said Hello to everyone and you know Pete is hard of hearing and so now we have to deal with these things !
44,11,2,Even "here"we do not get equal pay and benefits!
43,7,3,"Bespoke" in the description should have tipped me off to European sizing.
40,6,1,And my hands are slightly larger than normal, too.
36,2,0,So this is Atkins-Heaven?
40,2,1,Which one of Charlie's Angels are you?
41,4,2,Take it from me, being an angel isn't all that it's cracked up to be...
37,5,0,Don't mind me, I'm an astronomer checking out heavenly bodies!
38,8,0,I'm really not compensating for anything.
46,12,6,Women are from Venus, men are from Saturn.
47,2,2,It's a gilded hula-hoop. Don't tell the boss.
35,2,0,Have you heard from Adam and Eve?
36,0,0,When Bae farts in an elevator...
45,8,4,Even here, size still counts!
36,3,1,What do you mean there's no such thing as halo envy?
72,41,31,Next time, wash it in cold water.
38,3,0,Than thou, moi?
40,7,1,You should see the one they're making for Beyoncé.
43,4,4,The request was for a halo. Damn autocorrect.
46,12,6,Its not an act. I really am holier than thou.
36,0,0,There's a saying up here: the bigger the halo, the better the slip.
38,4,0,Well, I hear you haven't been much of an angel either, Ginger.
36,1,0,Heaven?
48,12,8,It's actually doing wonders for my core.
40,6,1,It's very simple, Sweetheart, I'm a transgender.
36,1,0,Oh Donald... Oh Hillary....Oh Donald...Oh Hillary...Oh Donald...Oh Hillary
39,4,1,It's my Hester-Prynne punishment for venial vanity.
40,5,2,I use to be in man holes.
38,0,1,Oh Grace, I hope falling for you isn't as bad as falling from you.
37,7,1,Me? I fell through a manhole!
51,21,10,If you are looking for equality, go to Hell.
36,0,0,........ and the worst part is I had three kids with her too....9
36,1,0,There is no glass ceiling for archangels
34,2,1,I never saw the 'glass ceiling' down there and I certainly don't expect to find it up here!
37,3,0,It is my last chance to break the glass ceiling
39,8,0,You're dumping me in Heaven. Who Does That!?
37,2,1,Still with the holier than thou attitude, I see.
38,7,1,I got this before I went on The Biggest Loser and lost 140 pounds but they won't change it in case I regain it.
40,13,0,I went with the platinum package.
43,8,4,Yes, bigger hands...keep going.
42,9,2,Why? Heaven only knows.
40,5,1,well it is my birthday.
37,3,1,It's not the hands that count.
39,2,2,You know what they say about the size of a man's halo...
34,0,0,Now that you're here, together we'll fight the old patriarchy.
41,7,2,Who knew God would be a woman?
37,2,0,Is there anything to eat around here?
41,7,3,I've got a big one
37,3,0,I funded my charitable foundation with the fortune I made selling male enhancement products on the Internet.
35,0,0,Don't know, even the saints' are smaller
37,4,0,Did it hurt when you fell down from Heaven? Because it looked kind of painful.
42,2,3,I still think metric is the more perfect system.
40,4,2,Halo, gorgeous!
38,4,0,Believe me, I DO have large hands!
44,16,3,It gets bigger every time I see you.
39,2,2,Why, yes, I did drive a Hummer!
38,6,0,Sorry to disappoint you, but this is what I got for being the nice guy who finished last.
39,5,1,I paid for a heavenly upgrade! It includes extra headroom.
43,7,4,Not even God could get Hamilton tickets without cashing in a favor
36,9,0,Didn't Saint Peter tell you about the Super Size offer?
41,17,0,I always ate all my vegetables.
37,2,0,It suits you.
36,2,0,Are we allowed to hula hoop?
44,5,4,Actually, I bought it on e-Bay...
39,5,1,Up here you can earn a whole 85 cents on the dollar!
43,9,3,Don't get excited, it doesn't mean what you think it means.
37,4,0,It's true what they say.
41,14,2,We need to make heaven great again!
38,5,1,I had small hands.
36,3,0,Well, ACTUALLY...
38,0,1,Honestly, Janice, I don't find St. Peter at all atractive...
38,1,1,Perfect. We're all single in Heaven. But of course my halo is bigger than yours.
40,9,2,I think you got your halo and hula hoop mixed up.
38,3,1,I was apparently very good at overcompensating.
42,9,3,It reflects my deep and fulfilling faith in female angels.
38,4,1,They're great in snow.
44,10,3,No,no, not a halo; just a hole I dropped through.
35,1,0,You know what they say about guys with big halos, great lovers.
39,9,1,I know...I know... it looks ridiculous, but the only size left was Republican Front Runner.
38,5,1,Yup, it's true what they say.
35,3,0,I've always had trouble jumping through hoops.
41,3,2,How about coming over here under my ring??
38,1,1,Yeah, I ran into Hulk Hogan over in hell the other day and even he was impressed.
39,5,1,Look, Honey, size matters!
40,3,2,My first hula hoop.
43,4,3,I was a protester at a Donald Trump rally.
47,10,6,Halooo.....where have YOU been all my afterlife?
36,4,0,Trust me honey, bigger is better.
40,6,1,I was wearing a Sombrero at the time of the accident...
35,0,0,Say 'That's what she said' again. I dare ya.
37,5,1,I must be in heaven because you look like an angel.
41,10,1,Oh, yeah, baby: I'm THAT good!
40,10,0,No, that's just a myth.
36,4,0,I don't know.. You just seemed holier in your profile..
41,9,2,And to think I argued with you when you called me ‘holier than thou.'
39,4,1,No, I said to turn left right here.
36,0,0,I'll take the Pinot.
39,5,1,I used to own a pizza restaurant.
37,5,0,Sometimes deed size does matter.
36,1,0,It's the last time you'll crash the car!
38,7,0,I couldn't take my Porsche with me.
43,8,4,There's nothing wrong with Costco
35,2,0,I got into a prank war with the apostles, and now I'm bumping halos with everyone.
35,8,0,Have I told you about the power of compound interest?
53,23,10,I saved a bus full of nuns.
43,18,3,I never once stepped on a crack.
41,8,5,I believe that they call it the Pinocchio halo.
42,9,2,What's a naughty girl like you doing in a place like this?
48,9,6,I’m confused. You’re my neighbor’s wife. I coveted you. Yet, here I am.
33,3,0,Perhaps, now you can finally see the difference between a halo and a Nimbus
42,6,2,It"s bigger because I was a Democrat.
38,3,0,But, how?! I made sure that nobody was watching.
52,22,8,Every Bernie voter gets one.
40,5,2,I don't see the point of a prenuptial agreement.
38,3,1,Being endowed with an oversized halo runs in the family.
40,8,1,Oh goodness! Am I manspreading again?
41,2,3,You're beautiful, but it appears our lifestyles aren't compatible
40,5,1,Actually, I was Donald Trump's alter ego.
49,13,8,I feel much more confident since my halo enhancement surgery.
43,11,3,I guess some of us are a little more angelic than others.
38,6,1,I had it custommade
37,5,0,No, it's not overcompensation!
43,9,2,Donald said I could have it, he's getting a bigger one !
36,4,0,Mansplangel
45,11,4,I guess it means I'm holier than thou.
39,3,1,The myth is actually true, and, "lasting longer than four hours' up here is an eternal non-problem.
40,2,2,If only you had listened
39,2,2,I've been looking for someone to sin with for a long time.
40,11,1,Why yes, I did drive a Porsche. Why do you ask?
41,8,2,They said there was a typo, and I ended up with a hula.
39,4,0,Will you fly with me?
41,9,2,It's in honor of my Hula Hoop championship when I was twelve.
38,4,1,Well, you know what they say...
38,3,0,I have waited all my life to marry you.
38,6,0,As I recall it, we bet double or nothing.
42,4,3,I know, I've been meaning to make an appointment with my urologist.
41,8,3,Don't let the huge halo fool you -- I'm really a bad boy who needs taming.
35,3,0,They're actually back in vogue this millennium.
38,3,1,So you know "gender has its perks"
42,16,3,I would sin for you.
46,11,5,I was very good.
45,6,4,You have no idea how I feel about you.
38,4,1,I always told you you had an angelic smile!
37,2,0,Angel and ANGEL
37,3,0,Its tempting, but I would lose several places in the halo competition .
43,7,3,Trust me. It's not compensating for ANYthing.
37,4,0,You know what they say, the bigger the Halo the bigger the...
45,8,5,I'm no longer the last man on earth, so how about NOW?
47,14,6,I put the lid down.
51,21,10,I need it to get FM radio.
39,4,2,I demanded the expanded version of humility.
39,2,2,Really, size does NOT matter ... I got mine in the 1960"s when EVERYBODY wanted hula halos
36,3,0,Yeah baby, you are in heaven. And what you heard about halo size and, let us say the ability of an angel to redeem, is true.
40,7,1,When you've been here long enough you get bonus points.
43,14,2,It's been more than four hours and I can't find a doctor.
41,2,2,In life I was a hula hoop champion...
39,4,1,See honey, this is what happens, when you're "always right".
39,6,1,My hands are very big too. Very, very big.
38,1,1,That neckline is so last millennium, but we'll let you in anyway.
42,12,3,Underneath it all, I'm really a humble guy!
36,2,0,Our wedding will be a double wing ceremony.
38,5,0,You need better proof?
51,18,9,You should have seen it before I learned humility.
42,7,2,Just because I'm holier than thou doesn't mean we can't remain friends and hang out like we used to.
37,1,0,My wife loves your eyes. I love other things also!"
35,1,0,Don't laugh. It's the last one. They don't make halos anymore.
42,12,3,I got an upgrade.
39,8,0,I don't want to play the evangelical card, but . . .
39,6,1,Beyonce lent it to me.
34,1,0,Hi Angel want to hula hoop?
36,0,0,Well I was killed by the bigger guy, so I get the bigger halo.
44,8,4,My father being an archangel had nothing to do with it. I earned this halo.
36,2,0,'Well, just because you're a politician don't think you are holier than thou.'
35,1,0,Yet my penis is still the same size it was on earth.
38,5,0,Oh of course, you think I need a slimmer fit... any more judgments today?
44,12,4,Not that I'm holier than thou, but...
40,8,2,Well......A big halloo to you
42,6,3,Let me saintsplain something to you.
44,17,3,Tragic hula-hooping accident. You?
39,9,0,I'd feel better if we just cuddled.
40,6,1,I defeated St Peter in the Mythic Legendary Halo championship match.
36,2,0,And so, finally being big in some ways is paying off.
40,5,2,I was told it will shrink in the rain.
41,8,2,Let's both agree that size doesn't matter here.
36,4,0,I told you that size mattered!
37,2,0,Where's a good place to get a bite to eat?
42,5,3,Two characters in search of a punch line, in a heaven-like environment.
35,0,0,Actually it's pronounced like heave. Heave-en.
42,9,1,I'm having trouble with my 'bad boy' image.
41,7,2,Yours may be brighter, but mine doubles as a Hula hoop.
36,3,0,Is it true you don't have to brag here?
44,9,2,Let's just say I didn't get it for good deeds.
36,7,0,Yeah, it's bigger since I went gluten free
39,3,0,$18.95 for my large pizza, how much for your small?
46,13,4,It's not the circumference that counts.
37,2,1,No, I haven't used any hairspray. Why do you ask?
47,25,6,I also have great WiFi.
42,10,3,Looks like the holes in the glass ceiling are no different here.
45,9,5,I used to work in a pizza parlor.
43,11,3,It's the Harvard difference, my dear.
48,12,7,I know it's big, you don't have to stare.
37,1,1,I suppose my halo-lujah was just haloier than most.
37,2,0,Second wives have to grow into the job.
38,4,1,I guess this is where we part.
46,17,5,I worked for Wham-o. And you?
37,4,0,Well ma'am, we Texangels is a right special breed.
36,3,0,If I knew I'd actually have to wear this ridiculous ring you got me for eternity, then I never would have said "I do."
46,8,5,I AM holier than thou. Isn't it obvious?
37,2,0,Trump said if you want the Equal Pay Act you can go to hell
38,6,0,it's actually the same size as my feet.
38,6,0,As the handsomest and most confident angel you will ever meet, rest assured that my head will grow into it.
43,5,3,I can't sleep on my stomach. How do you manage?
46,16,5,I had you at ha-lo, right?
38,4,0,Goodness ain't no hula hoop.
41,9,2,Halo? Hell no, I just fell through a hole.
39,9,1,When I behold your beauty , I can't control myself.
38,3,1,Of all the gin joints, in heaven she walks into mine…
38,6,1,It's special recognition for inventing the hoopla hoop.
40,2,3,Marilyn Monroe has an exclamation point.
47,13,6,You haven't upgraded to the Halo 6 Plus yet?
37,2,0,You always thought things were bigger than they really are.
43,9,2,I realize size shouldn't matter but.....
37,3,0,Freedom from sinning is decreed here, I know, but let's ask for just one little exception!
40,5,1,So Pride and Envy are no longer Sins of Exclusion. Who knew?
41,8,2,...I always lifted the lid.
38,7,0,What gender halo gap? There is no gender halo gap.
44,8,4,Holier than Thou. No, why do you ask?
39,8,0,They fitted me for a Trump halo
40,3,2,As long as it doesn't last longer than four hours, we're cool.
39,10,1,Yeah, you're right -- I AM holier than thou.
37,8,0,I drove a Porsche, why?
42,10,3,Now that I live in the cloud, I thought I’d splurge and go for the iHalo 6 Plus.
40,5,2,The truth is, they hold our impure thoughts.
42,8,2,I got all my values from 'The New Yorker'.
39,6,1,It equates to the opposite of small hands.
58,21,16,Yes, I am happy to see you. Why do you ask?
42,12,2,Does it make my ears look smaller
42,11,2,I suffered from compulsive virtue disorder.
37,4,0,It's not my fault the stereotypes exist.... hands, feet, halo what do you want me to say.
41,6,3,I got it for always voting Democrat.
36,6,1,THIS is who I am to judge!
42,15,2,I guess I am holier than thou, after all.
43,8,3,By the way, it's true what they say about the size of a guy's halo.
37,6,1,Some angels are "more equal" than others.
35,3,1,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
44,7,4,I got this for completing the bonus missions.
40,5,2,I know what you're thinking, I can't lie up here, there's no connection.
38,3,0,A freak hula hoop accident. You?.
42,6,3,You did notice I have very LARGE HANDS.
46,10,5,Trouble is, I AM holier than thou.
37,5,0,you are off key... you can NOT sing
41,14,1,Stop accusing me of taking a holier-than-thou attitude.
38,5,0,They always said I was holier than thou!
36,4,0,It's simple, the male ego is bigger!
41,4,3,I'm accused of being a snob, but actually I died hula hooping.
52,14,9,Mid after-life crisis?
36,4,0,So, I'm stuck forever with you, aren't I?
39,6,1,I am one of the very few males around here who wasn’t called a no good bastard by a female.
43,8,2,You have no idea how boring my life was.
40,6,3,After 25 millennia together - NOW you tell me you prefer the bad boy type?
41,5,2,I fell through the manhole and I saw the light.
44,6,3,Got them fooled up here too I see.
40,3,3,Sorry, you know what they say about men with big halos...
40,10,0,Not exactly. They told me it represents how much better than other people I THOUGHT I was.
47,13,6,Why, yes--I AM holier than thou.
42,7,2,I think it's because of my "holier than thou" attitude.
42,12,2,It used to be my waistband.
39,3,1,Sorry hun, you're just not good enough.
39,5,1,Remember, Eve, I was always holier than thou.
37,6,1,Yes, I'm over compensating for shortcomings in my previous life.
38,4,0,So I said, 'Listen, man, I think my halo is bigger than yours.' And he still wanted to argue!
40,14,1,In your picture, your wings looked bigger.
36,0,0,Ah hi, John, new here. Appears this is my "big enough to spoil you for heaven" phase.
40,2,3,Beyonce can see my halo better.
42,10,3,Free installation with wi-fi, $49.99/mo. for 2 years...but then...
41,3,2,Yeah, lets just say the halos get pretty picked over when there is half price sale.
37,5,0,Well, the perks aren't what they were since we merged with Amazon.
36,5,0,It goes along with the big hands
48,3,8,I worked at the returns counter in Costco.
39,9,0,I'd reeeally like to...but there's this reputation I've gotta uphold.
42,8,4,I showed Him how to put on voicemail.
42,12,3,I went to Harvard.
38,7,0,Hula hoop champion in 1959.
36,2,0,I'd say yours is about 73% as big as mine.
36,0,0,So you have your wings, don't expect a bigger Halo!
37,2,2,Maybe you should have thought of that before you majored in communications.
46,12,5,Yes, I'm afraid I am holier than thou.
41,4,2,It's like pinocchio, except for good deeds
39,4,1,It's on loan from the big guy Himself. But I assure you when mine arrives, it'll fit exactly the same way.
37,3,0,I'm just saying!
41,7,2,Lord knows, I am ready to downsize.
38,4,1,Turns out, it not the size of your hands after all...
40,5,2,Well you know what they say about Angels with big haloes.
35,3,0,Yes I know. You're impressed. Lifelong virginity is quite the accomplishment.
39,4,1,I'm related to Donald Trump.
39,7,1,It's for good behavior.
35,2,0,I was going to stretch my lobes, but they were having a special.
33,0,0,You are a beautiful little angel,who inspires the importance of heavenly bliss.
41,3,3,Oh, I'm no hero, I just tried to help a few friends out when the shooting started!
50,9,9,...probably because our Father always liked me best
48,11,6,What can I say? Father always liked me best.
48,11,5,It grows in the presence of celestial bodies.
39,10,0,When I order XXXL I assumed there would be some shrinkage.
37,2,0,Oh Lord. Even angels explain things to me.
36,6,0,Now you will finally understand why bigger does not mean better!
35,1,0,Let me take you away from all this.
38,3,1,I have big feet.
37,4,0,I was a hedge fund manager but I died young.
38,1,1,Yes, but you'll notice they took away my over-sized sweat pants.
38,2,1,But I'm honest about my manspreading. That's why I'm here.
44,9,4,What halo gap?
37,3,0,For not being greedy. Anyway, I think it's ironically hilarious.
36,4,0,Don't get the wrong idea. I really did good works...
40,3,2,Welcome to heaven for metrics analysts.
36,1,0,Better really IS bigger.ti
45,6,4,Tossed pizza crusts. What did you do?
36,4,0,Final tangible proof that size matters.
39,3,1,It was a "one size fits all" day promotion for those who otherwise wouldn't get in.
37,2,1,You know what they say about big halos, right?
38,1,1,So, size does matter, even in heaven!
45,16,5,When I ordered, I thought for sure Heaven was metric.
38,4,1,When you're the Hula Hoop Champion up here, a trophy just isn't enough.
49,10,6,Now, I don't mean to come off as holier than thou...
39,4,1,I'd like to give you a ring sometime.
34,1,0,The size of this Halo makes me look silly.
43,7,3,It's for my ego
41,3,2,So much for equal pay for equal work.
39,3,1,Private wake, you know how it is.
36,2,0,I guess you could say I followed all of The Rules.
36,3,0,"She still tends to over-compensate occasionally".
43,10,4,I really can't explain it. Seems like every time I see you it just gets bigger.
39,1,2,I'm a bit of a regular on the 'best saves' list.
39,5,1,Halo, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to notice me.
38,2,1,Oh, no, I'm not bigger than most guys, I'm just bigger than ALL guys.
27,5,0,I thought it would be different in heaven, thanks be to God!
37,0,1,I'm a throwback from the glass ceiling.
41,5,3,I remember saying that I wouldn't be caught dead with a hula hoop.
36,3,1,I'm not sure what it says about us that my hole is bigger than yours.
39,0,3,Back on Earth, I was called 'goodie goodie', so that defiantly has something to do with it...
50,13,8,I slipped Jesus a fifty.
36,2,0,There's no halo gap.
36,4,0,I am an elite angel. Check out my CV.

46,16,4,I'm the one who never watched porn.
39,3,1,I call it the Halo Hoop. I use it a lot while they're sleeping.
41,8,2,Unequal pay, unequal halos, but you get that nice sash.
49,17,7,I'm afraid it wouldn't work out. I'm holier than thou.
43,12,3,I did some extra credit.
42,9,1,All I can say is there are a lot of school teachers up here, but I was the first politician.
41,9,2,We always like to welcome new comers with a big halo.
40,8,1,Yeah, I've been doing Cross Fit.
37,3,0,Sometimes size can be a detriment
42,8,2,God's having a hard time getting that Equal Halo Act through Congress. Hopefully next year.
36,1,0,I'm told the big hands myth works differently up here.
33,2,0,Just wait until you see the orthopedist.
47,7,9,I guess I'm just glad to see you.
38,6,1,I used to have a swollen head but I've humbled down!
41,3,2,isn't it time for equal halos for equal good deeds?
45,8,5,I never masturbated.
36,4,0,I'm considering halo rejuvenation surgery.
38,6,0,You see, the glass ceiling wasn't really a problem. We both made it, didn't we?
41,11,1,It's a little thing I'm working on called a Hula Halo.
38,2,1,I'm a shower, not a grower.
40,10,1,I've died and gone to Heaven!
49,18,7,Your profile picture had a much bigger halo
38,2,1,Well if 'size doesn't matter' up here, why am I getting all the free premium channels right now?
35,0,0,NOT ON YOUR LIFE!
42,18,2,Sexism doesn't end. Sorry.
56,12,15,Actually, it's pronounced 'big halo', not 'big a-hole'.
43,10,5,I'd say the upgraded halo package was worth it
45,8,5,I'll have to have you meet my Father first.
46,8,7,I'm a vegan.
39,7,0,Yes, dear, I'm afraid that size still matters.
41,6,1,They call me 'Mr. Holier-than-thou' around the water cooler.
40,5,1,I didn't manspread.
39,3,1,Sometimes a big halo means, well, something else!
39,5,1,Oh, it definitely grows. But it takes time...
37,2,0,I like to think it's more tunic than dress.
47,11,8,. . . eighty pounds on The Biggest Loser, but it killed me.
36,4,0,The guys down at the halo store have assured me that size matters.

34,1,1,It is a PONDEROUS halo!"
37,0,0,It's good to have big hands, here and down below.
47,12,5,The last thing I remember is wearing a sombrero.
41,9,2,Alas...not my halo...just a hole in the ceiling...
44,10,4,Oh, nothing special; I never littered.
40,5,2,When I got up here I found out that size IS everything.
32,1,0,Hi Angel Face! Haven't we "halo-ed" somewhere before?
36,4,0,Obviously, darling, I'm wholier than thou.
42,3,3,Big hands, big feet, big halo.....
37,2,0,Well, you know the old saying about the size of your halo and..?
38,5,0,I guess I hafta tell you. Have you ever heard of Pinocchio's nose?
36,0,0,Your is so much bigger than mine.
38,4,0,That's from before I learned to be humble!
36,4,0,Heaven knows, it's about time we travel in the same circle.
42,7,4,I was so surprised to find out that size does matter.
40,5,1,Hula Hoop inventor..how d'ya guess?
41,3,3,Then I went to the registration desk and they said, 'just take the f***ing halo and get out.'
37,0,0,They only an extra-large.
40,4,1,Yes, I was a very good boy in life, which means I have a lot of lost ground to cover. You in?
42,5,3,When we were on Earth, you said size didn't matter.
41,9,2,Careful! Halo-envy is still ENVY.
39,8,1,I can explain!
35,1,0,okay how we about just give each other massages? or you could just rub it over my pants, that's okay right?
43,12,2,I ordered from the secret menu.
44,6,5,I'm not that good. I just invented the hula hoop.
41,4,2,I actually left the bathrobe right there in the hotel.
37,3,0,Hey! this beats living in our retirement community.
36,3,0,(Her)Ummmm...so we meet again...I thought you were going to the other place! ....(Him)What other place? (Her) U know! The other place?!
38,4,0,Oh thank you dahling. You are such an angel!
41,3,3,Once, I had a dinner party with some "gluten sensitive" friends.
39,5,1,It just means I've been here a lot longer...
38,3,1,I also drive a Porsche
43,4,4,My attitude comes the fact that I actually am holier than thou.
45,4,5,Since I met you I feel like I've died and went to heaven.
38,3,3,Oh, halo-o...
41,8,2,So ... do you finally accept that I'm holier than thou?
38,2,1,You and I both know your robe shouldn't be white
36,1,0,You're washing your hair this Friday?
36,2,0,This Halo model is hard to live up too!
34,0,0,I didn't pick this Halo
49,17,8,I'm a bit concerned. It's been that way longer than four hours.
44,12,3,I voted my conscience at the Republican Convention.
43,7,2,Yeah, I created the Halo Hoop brand. Business is booming.
37,1,1,I'm sorry hun, but nothing changes if nothing changes.
35,5,0,They were out of small.
36,5,0,I'm told I was a very shy person.
38,5,0,Yeah, I know, I'm still compensating; even here.
39,5,1,Come, I'll introduce you to Mother Teresa...
41,4,2,Listen, I know you said I'm too good for you but I don't agree...

39,9,1,5th grade. Hula Hoop champ.
38,5,0,Wanna halo-hoop?
45,18,6,How did you know I was lying?
37,1,1,Sure it suits you - but size really does matter
55,18,15,Sometimes I regret being the virgin Larry.
58,23,16,I'm the guy who always left the toilet seat down.
39,7,0,Yes, my halo's smaller, but it slips down and holds my hair in place.
42,5,3,Yep. It's all thanks to Miracle-Gro.
40,6,2,I get it!!! Women are tired of getting a 76% halo!
40,1,2,I received an extra perk, I was Trump's press secretary.
45,5,4,Yes, I'm really THAT good!
42,12,1,It's in recognition of my having invented the hula hoop.
49,20,10,You were the one who ate the apple, not me.
41,8,1,Yes. Big on virtue. Short on experience.
45,8,4,Wait until you see my hands.
38,2,0,Alas, yes, size still matters even up here to us males.
40,5,1,I admit it--I have a Napoleon complex.
35,2,0,How much do the gates of heaven weight? Enough to break the ice?
38,1,1,How do you like me so far? Don't rush. I have lots of time...
37,3,0,Really my first time, right.
39,2,1,You think it's big?
39,4,2,You can't tell me that size doesn't matter.
40,6,1,You have to jump through lots of hoops to become a perfect angel.
41,7,1,Some say my biggest sin is bragging about the size of my halo.
36,5,0,I hear our new boss has an equal pay policy.
44,5,4,What makes you think I am lying?
45,18,4,They never discovered my sins during audits.
46,9,5,I was meeker than most. Ironically, now I'm considered a show-off.
36,5,0,Well, I am no angel
37,9,0,Another one of those holier than thou types.
38,4,1,Its' not lifestyle specific.
47,14,4,I drove a Prius.
39,6,1,They need to do something about regulating drones up here.
47,15,5,It comes with unlimited text, talk and data.
38,11,1,Is it that obvious?
40,5,2,Of course I'm no angel. There's a hula hoop shortage, and I offered to teach the early morning classes.
42,12,2,I gave up dairy.
41,12,1,Actually, size does matter.
43,10,3,No I really am a Virgin
37,1,1,This is how I compensate for small hands.
37,0,1,I told you we would be together someday, sweetheart.
38,11,0,I had to cash in all my "selfless deeds", but I think it's a good look.
37,2,1,come fly with me heaven can wait
39,11,2,Having a great publicist is only part of the equation
44,17,5,Oh, how I wish that rumor were true.
40,6,1,Hello, I'm Johnny Angel, and together we will see how lovely heaven can be.
39,2,1,WOW--Heaven is a lot easier than Tinder!
38,3,1,and god said your hella fine
39,10,0,Even in Heaven I still can't impress women...
36,1,0,Up here it's not about hands.
41,11,1,No, I'm not especially good, but I did have a successful career as a pizza maker.
38,4,0,A marriage made in heaven is actually TRUE!
37,0,0,Oh, that's loop to go to hell."What!?
45,8,4,Do you know that you have a heavenly body?
34,1,0,I've really lost a lot of weight with the flying around
37,4,0,Oh no…you saw that?
35,1,0,On the plus side, we've banned that Eric Clapton song up here.
37,7,0,Come on. It's a fair trade. My hula hoop for your Frisbee.
39,7,1,It's a hula hoop. They are out of halos until next week's delivery.
39,2,2,Am I dead, Angel? Cause this must be heaven!
40,2,3,I always liked to think that size 'does' matter.
39,5,1,If this job has taught me anything, it's to look beyond appearances.
37,5,0,Hula hoop accident.
39,9,0,I'm supposed to work on my 'holier than thou' attitude.
40,10,1,I've upgraded for increased bandwidth!
41,10,1,Seriously, having a big one is truly overrated.
35,1,0,Foam parties ... whoever thought they'd make a comeback?
40,6,1,Size doesn't matter.
38,1,1,Can we go back to the French maid role play?
41,9,1,It's true what they say about angels with large halos.
43,10,3,I can't help it. It grows every time I see you with those beautiful feathered wings.
43,10,3,Well, I did jump through quite a few hoops to achieve this.
38,4,0,Charlie, you look pretty bored for an angel!
38,4,1,I'm guessing it's compensation.
38,2,1,Here our romance can truly last for eternity!
38,3,1,Yea, I stole somebody's halo then I hooped it, I hooped it.
39,5,1,The XL sizes were on sale.
37,5,0,I went on a great diet when l first got here,as you can see.
36,3,1,Elite prep school, drugs, Ivy League college, frat parties, drunken hookups, star athlete, rape. Minor time-out. Trust fund, Greenwich estate, Nantucket cottage. I've had a charmed life, wouldn't you say?
51,23,11,It's not an attitude. I am holier than thou.
48,10,8,You're right, I'm holier than thou!
41,7,2,Well, yes. It does make me "holier than thou"!
44,10,4,Someone's idea of a joke. . . I used to own a Big & Tall store.
36,1,0,If you had a blue dress on, I'd really be worried!
37,1,1,Actually,
41,6,3,Yeah, it's this app I've developed, Uber-Hailo
40,8,2,Face it honey, your family has been insufferable!
36,2,0,I know mine's a bit grubby, but it's so awkward getting it off with these damned wings.
43,16,3,For a buck, He supersized it.
36,3,0,Just a small halo...not all men die equally
38,4,0,Hey babe, watcha doin' after eternity?
37,0,0,It IS over-compensation. For my ENORMOUS unmentionable which Paradise forbade me.
40,12,0,Actually, this is regulation width.
40,0,2,He's my cousin 4th removed.
44,15,3,We're still a whole generation behind on gender equality.
45,18,3,This is nothing. You should see God's.

39,12,0,It's LED, it uses less energy.
37,3,0,I wasn't notified that ICloud was not available in my country.

41,7,2,Some women say it's the biggest they've ever seen.

36,2,0,Do you know where they keep the books of inspirational hymns?
36,2,0,This was a limited edition early bird on Kickstarter.
33,1,0,Take a guess. It is either for men only or I have a helium hula hoop.
45,7,4,If I can get it down around my belly, you'll see something really cool.
47,13,7,Yeah, they're sending me back to Purgatory to work off the rest of my ego.
43,8,1,Chauvinist!
36,1,0,More experience, bigger halo

36,0,0,Yes...the curse of a size 15 shoe...uh...sandal...here in The Cloud....sorry...
42,8,2,Can you guess what I'm thinking?
44,7,4,My hands are also larger than average.
51,13,8,It's called a Hula Halo. God's trying to appeal to a younger crowd.
40,3,2,I gave at the office.
38,4,0,On Tinder you said you were shorter.
53,22,11,Sorry. Happens every time it meets a cute halo.
42,6,3,...and a big hallo to you!
36,2,0,There's a new patron saint of gymnasts in town.
43,7,3,Well yes, smaller looks good on you.
39,5,1,'Glass cloud'? I don't know what you mean.
36,0,0,The woman god is trying to punch the man god during he is closing his eyes!
38,4,0,If you were minuscule in one area, they compensate.
39,2,1,Remember that old saying about the size of a guy's halo? Well...
40,10,1,Yes, I was texting while driving but it was a bible verse...
37,5,0,I'm not compensating for anything.
41,9,1,How about seven minutes of Heaven?
44,10,3,It's a loaner while mine's in the shop
36,0,0,You're a devil in heaven.
37,3,0,Don't judge a man by his halo.

42,8,2,Money talks.
37,2,0,You sure we're not over compensating just a little?
40,4,2,'Hula-Hoop-Halo' just had a ring to it.
42,6,3,I did a lot of good for a lot of bad people.
35,13,1,Am I in heaven or are you in Hell?
38,5,0,Not that you need the halo effect...
36,2,0,Of course, you know what they say...big halo, big...
41,9,1,Sorry, but even here we circulate in different orbits.
36,2,0,It's a new filter.
39,4,1,It's a hula hoop. He ran out of the regular ones.
45,10,4,It gives meaning to holier than thou.
42,5,3,I'm sorry to disappoint--it simply means I'm holier than thou.
47,22,4,Yes, I did pray extra for it

38,3,1,Big is better, baby--big is better.

38,10,0,It's the Beam Me Up, Scotty app.

39,7,0,Look who thinks he's "Man's gift to God!

41,7,2,Apparently, size does matter up here.
39,3,2,Muhammad & Prince are still in orientation, they let me use their halos.
42,6,2,Why do you need to see my hands?
40,4,1,I got it from the Big Guy himself.
43,9,2,This I can tell you - my halo is huge. There are no problems with my halo. And by the way, my halo and I are going to make Heaven great again!
37,2,0,Look at this halo! Is this a small halo? I guarantee you there's no problem.

48,11,7,*Sigh* Well what do you expect when you're wearing your wings like that?
43,11,2,You say goodbye, but I say 'halo'. 'Halo, halo...'
44,10,3,For just a little more, I super-sized it.
40,7,1,Yes, it's lovely here, but sometimes I miss arguing with agnostics.
39,2,1,After that night in Rome, I never thought I would see you again.
36,4,0,as I was saying, I am a feminist myself and believe in eqaulity.
37,1,1,My...what an enchanting halo. But if I remember corectly...hula-hoops eventually fall down!
39,5,2,Apparently, it's commensurate with ego.
39,11,0,'....so that's how I earned my 113th set of wings, but enough about me'
40,11,1,Yes, I'm the guy that fixed the Ozone layer, thank you very much.
38,1,1,Hmm .. I was hoping for more
40,3,1,I'd still rather be back on earth.
40,1,2,I cant wait to see his hands!
46,15,5,Actually I was thinking about Pizza.
37,4,0,The halo gap is just a myth, you know.
36,3,0,Yeah, I know...Metallica even did a song about me.
38,9,2,Now do you believe I was always right?
38,3,1,``Far be it from me to suggest size matters.''
38,6,2,Yes, I do believe there's a correlation
36,6,0,I was bigger when I first got in here.
37,2,0,Good in bed ? You bet I'm good in bed !

39,5,1,Up here, size matters!
45,7,4,I trust you've heard the expression "too big to fail."

39,4,1,I'm thinking pulling the car over first May have been a better idea.
40,8,1,I used to be a fireman.
36,3,1,How long is eternity ?
38,3,1,Don't be alarmed. Up here, I'm told that size down't matter.

42,14,1,Yea, you can see how well gender equality works here.
36,0,0,My achievements were greater than you. I am going to be a president next year.
41,8,2,Actually it's the manhole I fell through.
42,13,2,Yes I know, the big halo was not worth the life of celibacy
40,5,1,There's plenty of room under here if you want to know what it feels like to have a big one.
38,2,1,You're a lucky gal - every time I swipe right, it's a match.
45,8,4,AngelsMingle.com
39,7,1,Sorry, but this is what 'totally jacked with six-pack abs' means on the dating apps up here.
41,3,2,You know, it's true what they say you can tell about a man from the size of his halo.
42,6,3,I thought I ordered a medium.
47,14,6,I got an upgrade based on my frequent prayer miles
43,19,2,Aren't you glad we waited?
38,2,0,Actually, there's an inverse relationship between size and chauvinism.

38,2,1,I guess you weren't being passive aggressive after all.
40,8,1,I OD'd on Viagra.
36,0,0,Can you help me hide from Donald Trump?
38,6,0,I want to - you want to - but how do we do it with the wings?
40,10,3,I believe you're confusing big halo with big hands.
46,8,7,No, I am not compensating for anything!
41,15,1,Enough of my holier-than-though attitude? I AM holier than thou.
39,7,1,These wings are super real and this definitely isn't a hula hoop.
37,2,0,Yeah, I worked for Goldman Sachs...why do you ask?
41,11,2,Yeah, maybe one day, women will have halos the same size as men.
41,3,3,There's room for one more.
41,13,1,Don't get me wrong, I'm no Saint.
41,10,1,I wish size mattered up here, but it doesn't.
39,3,0,Because I have finally faced the reality that you will be taller than me for all eternity!!
42,7,2,It's not the size of the halo that matters.
39,4,1,I just dropped in to introduce myself.
40,4,2,Believe me, I am really good.
35,2,0,Great. I make it all the way here and I still have to deal with manspreading.
36,3,0,Well, on earth I stayed with this woman till the end. While I was with her she challenged me in every way, by what she said, what she did. I can't say I miss her, maybe you knew her, she went by the name of Joan Rivers.
37,2,0,Hi, I'm Richard. I invented the Hula Hoop.
40,5,1,I think it's time to take a "cold shower".?
48,18,5,Insecure? Why do you ask?
38,4,1,...my eternal mojo, and I thought, "Screw it! Go for the implant!"
38,6,0,Well, up here it's big halos that matter.
37,4,0,I can Halosplain everything.
39,2,1,But I also have small hands

43,6,3,I used to have a huge afro.
36,2,0,But Gabriel, I can't find my sword anywhere.
39,4,0,I don't think we are good together anymore.
41,3,2,The size of my halo is directly related to the fact that I died with you.

36,1,0,You have to be in double digits.
41,10,3,Around here, I'm known as God's gift to women.
42,11,2,To be honest, I'm a little sick of being good.
36,2,0,...but I'd have to leave here.
39,1,2,Size matters, especially in halos.
36,5,0,Really. Size does matter!
39,4,1,Um...It's not really a halo. Its a reminder of the manhole I fell into that caused me to end up here.
30,2,1,Oh, that? I was VERY good at hula-hoop.
35,3,0,Arbitration is a legitimate, legally binding, pathway into Heaven.
44,5,6,I was fitted in the 80s when my hair was bigger.
39,5,1,It's called the 'halo affect'—it makes me ridiculously holier than thou.
41,7,2,Careful, I'm not sure how big this thing is going to get!
39,3,1,The priest lied; it is not 'til death do us part'.
43,9,3,It's just a Hula-hoop. I died in the '50s.
34,1,0,Well I don't want to brag, but I'm one of the nicest you'll ever meet!
38,7,0,You're right, I shouldn't have had that last beer.
35,1,0,Barbie, does this mean that we're together forever?
41,9,2,I'm flattered, but frankly the trick has been getting through doorways
43,10,3,Guess who won this year's "Holier than Thou" contest?
45,6,5,Compensating for what?

37,4,0,God felt we needed more room for error.

39,12,0,I started contributing to the church very early plus compounding, voila!
38,5,1,Don't give me that look. I am literally holier than thou.
37,6,0,I know we should have fastened our seat belts

40,3,2,Mine is biggest.
39,8,0,There may be some lingering resentment.
42,3,3,I guess it gives extra points to remember the toilet seat.

38,4,1,I swear, I'm not just blowin' smoke!
35,3,0,My halo's bigger because I'm from Dallas, and you know what they say...everything's bigger in Texas

37,4,0,It is so good to see my little angel.
49,13,8,I was really, really good.
43,12,2,I made it myself, in shop class.
41,7,2,Does this halo make me look fat? Be honest!
46,11,4,Honestly, I always took your complaint that I was holier than thou as a compliment.
42,7,3,Wow! It's really as big as you claimed in your Tinder profile!
42,7,3,It's called 'radial enhancement'.
41,9,2,Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
41,12,1,Instead of selling my soul to the Devil, I shorted it.
38,5,0,Yes, you always were good at circular reasoning!
37,0,1,You know what they say about the size of a halo; it's all true.
48,8,6,"Does this Halo make me look fat"?

37,2,1,Yes, I'm saying size matters.
41,9,1,Well I think it looks vainglorious.
41,7,2,Size matters here too.
41,6,2,It's part of the new merit system HR is rolling out..
37,5,0,I thought that in Heaven we are all equal. Why is your hallow smaller than mine?
52,28,9,I taught junior high.
38,3,1,Yeah, but my hands are small.
39,12,0,I have an enlarged halo
35,1,0,Look, I'm just visiting my grandma.
43,11,2,It's not the size of the halo in the man, it's the size of the man in the halo.
42,10,1,Yep ... it means exactly that!
37,3,0,My monster from the id
37,4,1,My halo doesn't know that viagra doesn't work up here.

37,2,0,I don't care how big your halo is, still not gonna sleep with you.
40,6,1,Up here, hand size is irrelevant; it's all about the halo.
39,3,1,Apparently, even being a good Sudoku player was enough for me to wind up here.
37,4,0,I got it because I am humbler than anybody.
52,19,9,It's not the size, it's how piously you use it.
38,6,1,Heaven's got one heck of a weight loss program.
38,5,1,On the terrestrial plane I was something of a chick magnet.
47,11,6,For the last time, I'm not compensating for anything, Gloria.
36,0,0,'97 was the last year I'd work detail on Clinton
37,5,0,Trojan extra large
49,17,8,I died at Costco.
41,6,2,We Mormons work hard.
39,2,1,Unfortunately, it's only in relation to the size of a man's foot.
44,3,4,I'm the patron saint of cornhole players.
45,13,3,Flattery even works on you-know-who.
46,11,7,I'm sorry if I seem holier than thou, but actually I am.
38,3,1,It's an upgrade. You can read by it. Comes with a power switch.
43,11,2,Would you like to play with my hula hoop?
47,13,5,Yes dear, I'm sorry... you're right.
38,5,0,The diet plan didn't explain that the halo wouldn't shrink with me.
42,10,3,What do you mean "overcompensating"?
38,7,0,Well, yeah, it's true, but it's not like it's going to do us any good up here.
34,2,0,It has to be this wide so it doesn't crush my giant angel nuts.
33,1,1,That's not the only thing that's big.
39,7,2,You must be new here
37,4,0,This is truly a marriage made in heaven.
40,6,1,I don't like to brag, but Sully Sullenberger had a little help from yours truly.
40,5,1,I told you to let God win that last round of Halo XBOX 360.
71,34,31,I was cleaning the kitchen, without being asked, and that's all I remember.
42,8,2,I worked for this halo. White male privilege had nothing to do with it.
38,4,1,Big Hands or Big Halo. You decide...
36,2,0,Is it true what they say about the size of a man's halo?
42,3,4,"Is it true what they say about men with big halos"?
51,13,8,Totally worth a joyless existence on earth.
37,9,0,I asked them to supersize it.
38,1,1,A hula hoop..?! Well, mine can be used as a diaphragm.
41,9,2,It used to belong to a guy from Texas
42,7,2,I earned it. Do you remember the movie, It's a Wonderful Life?
40,7,1,Mine doubles as a lasso...what does yours do?
38,7,1,I,too, was once a little naughty.
39,6,1,Sorry, I'm waiting for my husband to die.
46,10,6,Turns out I AM holier than thou.
39,10,1,Oh this only happens when I meet a really pretty angel.
39,3,1,Is that why you're hiding your small hands?
39,2,2,They call me Pinocc-halo.
44,8,4,I doubled my contribution to PBS.
40,6,1,Well, if you think THIS is big, you should check out my hands.
43,6,2,Heaven can wait.
38,4,0,I was beamed up sooner than I had ever expected!
38,6,1,Yes, I have a big one, but I have other attributes as well.
45,8,4,My doctor said I should keep an eye on it.
43,13,3,Because I didn't swear, steal, cheat on my wife; but mostly because I didn't vote for Donald Trump.
36,2,0,The fewer sexual partners, the larger the halo.
40,4,1,I lived every one of the Ten Commandments.
37,7,0,R e a l l y, Holier than thou!
40,6,2,Me? Oh, I owned a Pizza Restaurant!
43,6,2,A match made in heaven!
44,15,4,You should see my wingspan.
40,3,2,Look at my halo. Is that a small halo? I guarantee there is no problem
39,8,1,I used to work for Apple. It's called an Infinity Loop.
39,6,1,Until it's fixed, I'm stuck with the hula hoop
39,9,0,Up here, it is the size that counts.
35,2,0,This is just temporary until one in my size comes back from the fallen angel department.
50,10,7,I don't know, I got to the pearly gates, said hi to Uncle Peter and here I am.
36,4,0,Why yes, ma'am, I reckon I do happen to come from where the buffalo roam.
44,7,4,It's a side effect of the medication that I was taking for erectile dysfunction.
39,11,0,Your cloud or mine?
41,7,2,It was you who always said "Size doesn't matter."
36,3,0,Haaalo from the other side.
46,6,5,It's not the size of the halo but the motion of the devotion, baby.
40,4,2,Want to do something that will make us lose our wings?
41,9,2,The gates were closed when I arrived, hence the upgrade.
45,17,3,To be honest, I'm kind of a big deal up here.
34,1,0,I just love your ego. Your ego is quite overwhelming!
39,1,1,No, the restrooms are not gender specific.
47,10,6,I was the billionth entrant at the pearly gates so they supersized it for free.
36,1,1,'Can we skip the obvious penis joke please?" ' "Can we skip the obvious penis joke please?"
40,6,1,Greetings, I'm Adam Holier Than Thou.
38,10,1,Yes, it means exactly what you think it means.
41,8,2,No, for halo it's true. Hands and feet are a myth.
45,12,4,Some say its because I made more money than god.
38,1,1,Even here, size still matters.
42,9,2,I'm the first to die in a Tesla
44,9,3,I tell everyone I was really good, but it's actually a hula hoop.
37,3,0,Can I interest you in the Bernie Sanders Revolution?
42,3,4,Up here, it's not size that matters, but circumference.
36,2,0,...And how much did you smoke Whitney?
63,37,21,Pleased to meet you, obviously.
33,2,0,You can tell I am Mr. Right based on the size of my halo!
42,10,1,Oh, I'd always heard that size didn't matter."
35,5,0,It's not going to work. I'm better than you.
41,9,3,Mine is a portal
39,7,2,I'm not mansplaining - I actually am holier than thou.
43,7,4,I also have really big hands.
56,10,15,Wait till you see my harp.
35,5,0,When it comes to haloes you can't have one that's too big.
37,5,0,Hey, Babe! There's room for two in my heavenly inner circle.
37,5,0,Someone slipped a Viagra in my halo.
49,9,6,I don't know what to say, I thought this was going to be a Playboy cartoon.
40,6,1,Don't tell. It's a hula-hoop.
51,21,9,I invented ice cream.
38,2,0,I said "halo hoop," loser.
37,1,0,I see that we are going get along quite well and often!
41,11,3,I'm off to a Kentucky derby party!
37,2,0,Well Hello. I certainly hope size matters.
37,4,1,I went with the Hula Hoop for nostalgic reasons.
39,4,1,I bequeathed my estate to the church.
39,3,1,Yes, I was the valedictorian at my seminary university. Why do you ask?
38,6,0,I couldn't fit my whole profile picture on Match.com
37,4,0,It must be Father's Day!
48,9,5,Hey, great wings.
41,13,2,Yep, I won the hula-hoop contest last night!
42,8,4,It’s not an attitude – I actually am ‘all holier than thou’.
44,14,2,It's not the size, it's the...no wait, it is the size.
39,7,2,Oh my god! What the halo happened?
45,8,5,Because I never once wrote anything in the comments section.
50,15,9,I've lost a lot of weight since I got here.
39,4,2,After I lost my third halo, St Peter refused to give me a new one. I found me this hula hoop in lost and found.
39,6,0,Well at least you broke through the cloudy ceiling.
43,7,4,This is not what I meant when I prayed to become well endowed.
39,3,2,Something tells me that you're overcompensating.
37,4,0,Now you're mad at me because I actually am holier than thou!
40,3,1,What made you think Heaven wasn't a patriarchy?
38,3,1,This is obviously a trap.
39,6,1,Before you say that size doesn't matter...
36,6,0,Yeah... you could say that I’m a pretty big deal up here.
43,12,3,I invented the "hula-hoop", St. Peter thought this would be funny!
44,11,4,My guess is that I was correct about global warming.
42,5,2,Around here they say that size does matter
39,2,1,Good girls go to heaven (bad girls go everywhere)
37,3,1,Well, the pills did say, "Satisfaction Guaranteed in this life and the next!"
41,9,3,It's all silicone and only one week recovery.
36,1,0,You said size doesn't matter!
34,1,0,If I stop drinking RedBull, will my wings disappear?
39,2,1,I'm C=2piR and you're C=piD.
40,2,1,It's the result of my naturally holier-than-thou W.A.S.P. attitude.
38,5,0,This brand runs big.
39,5,1,No, my hands are also large. I'm just keeping them warm.
36,5,0,Hi, my name's Richard Knerr and I invented the Hula-Hoop.
39,11,0,I used my bonus miles to get the halo upgrade.
42,17,2,I used to change the diapers.
39,2,1,OK, In a previous life it was a hula hoop. How about yours?
50,19,12,Well yes, I actually am holier than thou.
42,14,2,Loop hole.
77,33,38,My eyes are down here.
37,9,0,Because I'm so humble.
42,6,2,With that neckline it doesn't surprise me too much."
38,4,1,I've been put on the Trump case, assigned to be the better angel of his nature.
36,2,0,Why yes I did marketing for a fast food chain
44,7,4,There just aren't that many ways to overcompensate up here.
36,3,0,Up here it's called the Ozone Diet.
46,15,5,Does my halo make me look fat?
41,8,3,Eternally speaking, size does matter.
37,2,0,We're not permitted to brag but it's a fact that the size of your halo is proportional...
41,5,2,My family includes charter members of this place.
38,2,1,I like to think it's relative to how Holy I am, but they say I should have read the size chart.
36,2,1,I think I may be compensating for my small hands.
49,15,8,It lasts for up to 4 hours.
40,15,2,I think everyone's pretty surprised.
38,5,0,What I am saying is, having met you, I am definitely ready to live a little
41,13,1,My goodness grows when I'm near you!
44,14,4,What can I say? I'm Blessed.
44,10,3,I'm not one to brag, but I did invent the hula hoop.
53,31,13,If it lasts more than 4 hours I am calling the doctor.
38,6,0,Not sure about halos, but I do know fingernails and hair continue to grow up here.
35,1,0,'Mine's bigger'
45,10,5,Actually I am hollier than thou
64,28,22,I once won The New Yorker caption contest.
38,3,1,I told you so!
39,4,1,I told you mine would be bigger than yours.
40,5,1,Up here, size really does matter.
40,6,1,Yes, I hold myself in high esteem. Why do you ask?
46,21,4,I guess I'm happy to see you.
38,4,1,It's hell to be in heaven!
37,1,1,They're coming in hula hoop size these days.
38,4,1,Good heavens, what a large nimbus you have!
39,8,0,Jezebel. That's an interesting name.
43,21,3,All they had left was the extra-extra large.
39,4,2,The Halo supplier made a mistake and sent me a Hula.
39,5,2,Well, obviously I am halo-ier than thou.
37,5,1,I think we both know that size does matter.
36,0,0,(Feb. 2017) Obviously our new President Hillary Clinton's bill is still pending but she'll keep at it and I'll be grandfathered in...its in the fine print!
43,6,3,Have faith, my dear: As above, so below.
46,5,6,Ironically I got it for not manspreading.
39,7,0,No, I an not still compensating.
37,7,0,And what would make you think I earn more than you?
35,1,0,"Eagle scout as a youth, high school valedictorian, multi-millionaire as an adult. Need I go on?
45,7,4,Well ah, yes, I am holier than thou.
44,7,4,Think of it as the heavenly wage gap.
49,23,9,Sometimes a halo is just a halo.
39,3,1,Why is your halo so big?" "You gotta do helpful things, like telling people that 15 minutes could save them 15% on car insurance.
38,5,0,".just love the size of your.........halo".
41,5,2,Funny how things are the same but different here.
41,8,1,Let me guess. You were a priest.
39,6,1,I let the size of my halo do the talking.
43,8,3,I swear I'm not a virgin
35,2,0,It’s obvious which candidates we are guardian angels of.
38,4,1,They fit it for my ego. What can I say? God loves me most.
55,16,8,I've always been an over achiever.
36,4,0,Just imagine what I'm trying to compensate
39,4,1,That's right -- big halo, big feet; everything else in proportion.
38,1,1,Did I know him?
40,12,2,Want to come over and see my miracle collection?
36,6,0,I cleaned the portasans at Woodstock.
37,3,0,Nah, I still won't believe it until I see the size of your hands.
41,10,1,How did I do It? Simple. Stay out of politics, away from the stock market, and eat all my vegetables.
39,6,1,You know what they say about male angels with large halos.
42,12,3,Thanks, but sainthood was really my fall-back position.
38,2,1,Now what?
43,10,4,It won't get in the way, I promise!
38,4,0,There's no problem there, I can assure you.
41,9,2,Yeah, I know, weird...good lookin' guy like me dies a virgin. But it's true!
37,2,1,I heard size matters.
39,5,1,Being the "Guardian Angel of Hula Hoops" has its perks.
38,4,1,You see, mine IS bigger.
46,8,5,I guess it's because I once fired Donald Trump
43,4,3,Not to brag, but I've lost a ton of weight since coming up here.
38,6,0,I can assure you my intentions are honorable.
38,5,0,Yes, it hard to fold up. Why do you ask?
38,4,0,You have an apple? Sounds like déjà vu
37,3,1,There is no such thing as halo inequality.
38,5,0,Welcome, sister, to LGBTQ Heaven. How's about I trade you my king size halo for that slinky little gown?
37,2,1,From the outside, it must look like Swiss cheese.
36,2,0,It seems the more recommendations, the smaller the halo.
44,5,3,No, please...I'm a Jehovah's Witness, one virgin is enough.
37,5,0,You know what they say about guys with big halo's.......
43,11,2,I thought they were giving out something else so I said, "Give me the largest one."
37,3,0,I'm a feminist
41,6,2,I'm not saying that size matters, just that mine is bigger.
36,2,0,I'm a fan of Donald Trump and tend to exaggerate.
36,2,0,With this enlarged halo, it takes me about five full minutes to harp.
38,4,1,It's true what they say, I know, about angels and the size of their halos.
41,7,2,Inversely proportional to number of sins, I swear.
38,2,0,Don't look at me like that! It's not the way it looks. It's ah...ah...a hoola hoop.
42,6,2,Mine is from Costco...!
38,5,1,God thought it would compensate for my small hands....
44,13,6,You wouldn’t believe the hoops I had to go through to get here.
40,6,1,Yes, it is - and I've noticed a lot of you girls here have halo envy.
38,3,0,These wings are detachable.
39,10,1,, ..., and it has an SPF rating of 100!
38,5,1,Let's just say Trump would never call me Little Marco.
42,12,2,Actually, it's more of a curse.
39,5,1,Oh, Honey. You'll make friends. I mean, being alive wasn't all peaches and cream either.
33,1,0,Want to play with my halo?
45,8,4,Turns out Viagra is the one thing you CAN take with you...
49,11,7,Exactly what you think it means.
50,19,7,Why yes, I am very happy to see you. How did you know?
39,3,1,I guess in heaven size really does matter!
45,10,4,Yes, I am the person who invented s'mores.
42,6,3,What can I say. On Angelbook, I've got more friends.
41,6,3,I just wish you told me you preferred the bad boy type before I wasted 25 millennia.
43,13,2,I never drop a call.
42,6,2,It's actually a repurposed hula hoop; the one I was using at the time.
38,6,1,I won't make snap judgements if you don't.
37,3,0,We're headed over to the community garden.
37,3,0,Cute headpiece, but mine doubles as a halo hoop. Wham-O!
38,3,1,Halo Mackerel, your making me blush!
43,7,3,Its my angel of the month award--I also get to go out to lunch with the Boss!
33,3,0,I'm a louse but I DID finance 3 dozen Broadway shows.
39,7,0,I know what you're thinking.
42,8,2,This was an unintended side effect of my weight loss.
42,3,3,It was to make up for my small hands
48,11,7,Say the word and I will jump through it.
60,18,19,My eyes are down here, Missy.
44,10,4,So you must be the Virgin Gary, am I right?
43,7,3,Oh, sure. But it doesn't count for much up here.
38,4,1,I'll just say this: Indulgences aren't cheap.
43,16,3,Shhh, I stole it from Ghandi!
37,5,0,Actually, it signifies the same thing that big hands do.
42,13,1,It's actually an iHalo 6 Plus, it was just released last week.
45,6,5,I died in a sombrero.
39,2,1,Everything I did was HUGE.
42,5,2,I’m not as good as I look.
48,19,5,I recently lost a lot of weight.
41,4,2,Bigger is better.
37,4,0,You probably think I think I'm holier than thou.
44,12,5,Essentially I'm holier than thou.
44,9,4,Class of '16 Halodictorian!
36,0,0,I'm always imagining it's bigger.
38,7,1,Hula Hoop Champion, 1976, and you?
38,5,0,Good things come in small packages. Better things come in bigger packages.
37,7,0,Its actually a hula hoop. I was junior champion back in the day.
45,12,5,I’m literally holier than thou.
38,4,1,I guess the rules are different up here, but down there I was considered an angel for not hitting on every woman
36,1,0,I'm sorry, but I've moved on.
46,7,6,I'm not compensating for anything if that's what's you're thinking.
36,4,0,Of course, you've heard what they say about halo size.
48,14,6,Yes, I am happy to see you, but the size of my halo has nothing to do with that.
36,5,0,My hands are pretty big too.
41,7,2,am I seeing heaven or is just me?
38,6,1,Hula hooping accident, what about you?
39,14,0,Do you think it makes my butt look small?
37,0,1,Why were we so dishonest?
43,11,2,It's really a hole in the ozone layer.
48,19,5,Do you think it gives me that 'holier-than-thou' look?
39,2,2,And so what if the eye of my needle was a little bigger?
41,6,2,I'm assigned to Trump.
40,7,2,Yes, I invented the Hula Hoop.
38,5,0,I hope the size of halos determines intelligence.
39,4,0,Funny,back on earth bigger meant better
36,1,0,Actually, it's about ethics in prophesying.
53,14,12,Apparently God has a sense of humor, I was an atheist before I landed here.
51,20,10,I always put the seat down.
36,3,1,Isn't it wonderful? They knew I was a size queen.
37,6,0,No, really: it's okay. My wife and I are separated.
39,8,0,Really it's just hula hoop. I brought it with me.
37,4,0,Yes, it's bigger too.
38,5,0,Let's just say that if I decide to run for archangel, there will be no problem in that area.
49,18,8,My halo is evidently excited to meet you.
38,3,1,To fit through that small hole.......you must be a size four, right?
37,3,0,The Super-sized version accommodates one's ego.
37,5,0,What makes you think I did something heroic?
39,14,1,I suppose you prefer bad boys.
40,7,3,I'll trade you my hula-hoop for your frisbee.
36,1,0,I also voted for Donald Trump.
40,8,2,I bought an XXL, thinking it would shrink.
36,1,1,I don't think size matters up here.
48,8,9,I'll make heaven great again!
39,5,1,I guarantee you there's no problem.
41,5,2,Yes... size will ALWAYS matter...
45,6,4,OK, so you left the iron on. Does it really matter now?
45,5,4,You like it? It doubles as a hula hoop.
39,3,1,Mine's actually a lenticular cloud.
41,15,1,No, I'm not overcompensating for anything.
46,20,4,I've waited for a woman like you all my after life.
41,5,3,It's complicated.
39,4,1,Yeah, first in my group to get to the last level of Halo.
40,5,1,Big shoes, .......
48,15,5,Gender equality hasn't come this far yet.
40,10,1,Be honest... did you swipe right after seeing the size of my halo?
36,0,1,It's om the "Mom's View" setting.
40,12,1,It covers a multitude of sins.
38,2,1,I traded my halo for a hoop so I could hula in heaven.
40,3,2,You're STILL making me jump through hoops.
41,10,1,I just keep things in perspective.
41,3,2,I was in a hula hoop accident. And you?
43,11,2,I used to have a very big head.
36,4,0,I guess I got my karm-uppance.
36,6,0,Big halo ---- Big hands.
37,5,0,A few more promotions should get you one like mine.
37,2,1,Seriously, the guys use hulahoops? Don/t you think eventually God will notice?
45,11,4,It appears that I had a lot more fun getting here than you did.
44,6,3,Rub yours, it will get bigger, too.
37,5,0,So how did that "Saving yourself for pure spiritual love" work out?
37,3,0,Hot yoga, baby!
44,8,5,Yes...I'm THAT good.
44,4,4,I was President Trump's Press Secretary for all eight years.
38,7,1,I had an ego problem on earth.
45,15,5,It turns out being 'holier than thou' is a real thing.
50,11,7,You know what they say...'big hands, big halo'
46,13,5,I'm told my only sin was sanctimony.
36,2,0,HE told me he doesn't like my holier than thou attitude.
40,4,2,My uncontrollable flatulence has created the hole in the ozone layer above my head.
41,5,2,When I see a pretty girl, it grows larger. Can you imagine that?
41,9,2,The pearly gates weren't wide enough. I had to come in through the loading dock.
37,5,0,Beyoncé wrote that song about me.
37,5,0,I guess I was right about Trump and the nuclear button.
39,3,1,The decline of the halo is something I need to get used to.
49,17,6,Actually, I got it on Amazon.
41,14,1,I can't begin to tell you how many hoops I jumped through to get in here.
39,6,1,It's a bit understated for my taste, but you make it work.
38,3,1,Not Hoopla, Hula Hoop!
37,3,1,I should've known that being the 'nice' guy wasn't going to get me very far here
43,7,3,It's a punishment for boasting.
38,4,1,Why the attitude? Because I am holier than you.
45,17,3,Fifty years ago women didn't even have halos.
43,9,2,How'd you guess I drove a Hummer while alive?
48,22,6,The extra large comes with a heavy conscious
36,0,0,I don't usually tell this story, but, I was Hula Champion of the World until I got my wings...
39,4,1,I died in a hula hoop mishap.
39,8,0,Where I grew up, bragging was considered a virtue.
48,12,6,I had to overcompensate when I was alive too
50,27,8,I was having a bit of a mid-afterlife crisis.
38,3,1,I'm don't want to blow my own trumpet but my halo is huge, really huge.
34,1,0,I'd like you to think I'm big everywhere!
41,4,2,I died while hula-hooping.
37,2,0,I can offer you a great deal on this hula hoop.
53,8,10,Nice, right? Turns out mine was the deciding vote that defeated Donald Trump back in 2016.
37,3,0,"As tight as Dick's hatband" didn't have the same ring after he died.
39,12,1,I use it as a hula hoop when I get bored.
42,8,3,It's my old man's, but he let me take it out for a spin.
41,3,2,And then I said 'Actually, sweetie, all lives matter.
38,4,0,Well, at least you admitted you weren't a virgin
40,4,2,I used to be a lot bigger.
40,7,1,You're preaching to the choir there, sister.
50,9,8,Equal halos!? Where do you think you are... Utopia?
48,12,6,What patriarchy?
39,6,1,I was a professional hula hooper and St. Peter thought it funny to constantly remind me of it.
41,5,1,I'm sorry to tell you this, Harold, but it's the size of the hands, not the size of the halo.
35,2,0,I was hit by lightning while pulling a Macy's Thanksgiving Parade balloon, but it doesn't mean I'm too good for you.
43,6,3,It's not how big it is, it's what you do with it.
38,8,0,Don't give me that holier than thou look
38,3,1,They say the size of a man's halo...
39,4,2,I'm telling you without 'Pride' that I made Angel of the Month.
39,2,2,It's kind of embarrassing, now everybody knows I was a porn star.
36,7,0,I invented the Hula Hoop, why do you ask?
40,9,2,I can't tell you how many times I've been mistaken for Him!
82,20,39,It was autocorrected to 'hula.'
36,5,0,I "liked" more Facebook posts than you did.
37,2,0,I saw it on an infomercial - Hulation- levitating hula hoop.
40,6,2,Trump loaned it to me.
40,7,1,They let me recycle my old hula hoop.
36,1,0,I was a lawyer and had a house in the Hamptons. Come here often?
38,4,1,I earned this big halo, and it's not compensating for anything.
43,5,3,I worked in fast food most of my life so they let me supersize it.
38,3,1,And for my next hula-hoop trick...
39,2,1,I'm sorry, sis, I used to practice on your hula hoop when you weren't around. I guess I was better than you.
38,4,0,Well, Father was Deacon.
49,13,6,It only happens when I get excited
40,2,1,"Oh," He says, "It's too small," He says, "So, what about this size? Better?" Then He just walks away, laughing.
37,5,0,Sorry, I don't date angels with big halos.
36,1,0,Let me know when my halo stops shrinking.
37,2,0,Apparently it's a reflection of my ego.
47,10,6,I didn't know being an alter boy would make such a difference.
36,4,0,First I got looped, then I got hooped.
54,39,14,Thanks, I've been working out.
38,3,1,Yes, but where do the wings and halos go when we . . .?
41,12,2,I'm scheduled for halo reduction surgery.
40,2,2,...And you know what they say about men with big halos...
45,11,5,Would you call God? It's been longer than four hours.
49,9,8,Even up here, the gender pay gap is real
38,2,1,You have incredible tips!
38,2,1,Yes, bigger is better.
36,1,1,You've no idea. It's REALLY big.
44,13,3,"My halo is in the shop and they didn't have any replacements, so they gave me a hula hoop instead".
35,0,0,Hi, Hillary. It's me, Bernie. Things are a little different up here. Aren't they?
40,6,1,I'm dilated you made it here!
50,22,10,We were both good, I was just better.
46,10,4,No. For your information, this doesn't mean I died a virgin.
40,7,2,Once again, size DOES matter.
42,6,2,Now you know that anything you can do, I can do better!
39,7,0,Where's God?
41,11,1,I do good great.
41,3,2,I think because it helps balance out my extreme shoe size?
39,3,2,It's my God Hole.
40,6,2,Yeah me and God. We're really tight.
37,4,0,I checked and He said it ain't braggin' if it's true.
53,20,10,You know, in retrospect, I wish I'd been a little less good...
39,3,1,I have small hands, but a big halo
37,3,1,Where are the other 71?
44,7,4,my death was magna cum laude
36,9,0,Don't be embarrassed, hon. Yours is supposed to be smaller.
36,3,3,.. yes.. and I'm Jewish..
45,6,5,"Yes, you had to put up with me your whole life, but I had to put up with your mother." (I submitted this under my another email but it had a typo so I'm resubmitting under this email)
45,13,4,The key is negotiating on the way in.
40,11,1,I see you're admiring my girth.
42,2,3,The William Morris Agency. Why do you ask?
40,2,2,I know I'm in Heaven, An Angel with a Small Halo
39,2,1,I guess we travelled in different c
38,6,0,Now I can honestly say that I will love you forever.
42,10,1,Actually, I'd say it's hu-uuu-ge.
42,10,3,I've been blessed.
37,2,0,Just tell me it wasn't my brother.
39,11,1,As you can see, I have a lot on my mind right now.
39,3,1,You're still a holier-than-thou showoff.
45,8,5,My realm or yours?
44,18,3,You can't be afraid to negotiate.
46,9,6,You forget all those summers spent at your mother's.
45,7,3,People who say size doesn't matter haven't been to heaven.
39,4,0,Oh no. You're not gonna be an angel, are you?
46,28,5,Sure, but try parking it.
41,12,2,I try not to come across as 'holier than thou,' but this makes it difficult.
41,4,2,As it turns out, size really does matter.
37,2,0,It was supposed to look more like a parachute, but I guess that I can"t complain.
46,12,4,I guess I am holier than thou
41,4,2,Don't feel bad. I'm just nicer than you.
35,5,0,Why do you say that I think I'm holier than thou?
34,1,0,Yeah. Now I know how it feels.
41,9,3,Please don't think I'm compensating.
37,5,0,No, I do not have small hands!
47,7,6,It's not exactly what I meant when I said 'extra large.'
43,5,3,Thanks, but wait until you see my hands.
44,9,3,Yeah that's right, I'm that good.
37,7,0,It doubles as a hula hoop.
37,5,0,You know, it's true what they say about big haloes.
44,9,2,Okay, okay. I lied.
43,14,3,Yeah, I did a few rescues. Some pro bono work. How about you?
38,4,2,It turns out He's pretty much OK with manspreading.
42,8,2,As a matter of fact, size does matter.
43,10,1,Why do you say I have a holier-than-thou complex?
33,1,0,Did I tell you Cain was my brother?
43,15,4,They said if the condition lasts for more than 24 hours to consult my physician.
37,4,0,Yeah, rumors are swirling that it's to compensate for other things. Not true.
41,12,2,I brought my ego with me.
53,19,10,So, what is a bad girl like you doing in a place like this?
38,4,0,Yeh I know... You're tired of dating nerds.
38,3,3,My feet are big, too.
40,2,1,Hate heights hate flights hold me.
40,3,1,I prayed to the Porcelain God.
42,13,3,I'm really, really good, if you know what I mean.
39,3,1,What? They wouldn't let me bring my big truck.
36,2,0,We're in heaven, so let's sin away.
38,5,1,No, I'm not still overcompensating!
39,4,1,I got here because I never lied to any woman that I had not met.
42,14,2,I lost the weight and nothing fits anymore.
38,0,1,Listen Ted, you've taken the 'holier than thou' schtick too far this time.
38,1,1,Halo there!
43,11,3,I've tried shrinking it, but my ego keeps getting in the way.
39,1,1,The last woman who gave me that look, called me a "spreader" and knifed me on the subway.
36,2,0,I'm afraid it's the inverse...
38,3,2,C'mon let's give it a whirl.
40,7,1,You are an angel not to mention my big halo.
38,3,1,But now I wouldn't know "fun" if it hit me in the face...
38,3,1,I was a big Oprah fan.
39,3,1,I have really big hands as well.
38,7,0,My death was caused by a hula hoop.
41,4,2,You thought the wage gap was only a problem on earth?
45,16,3,Halo equality is still only a goal.
39,0,1,No, it's not overcompensation for my Trump-like physical shortcomings.
36,1,0,Hmm, I see my ... halo is not as big as yours
36,6,0,I listened to everything my wife said on the other side.
37,4,0,You should see the size of my hands!
44,5,4,'Size doesn't matter,' I believe were your words.
47,16,7,No, I don't think it makes you look fat.
40,8,1,Plastics.
50,25,7,I used my miles to upgrade
39,2,1,Well, you've finally broken through the glass ceiling.
41,4,2,I'm compensating after the fact.
49,15,7,I've been dead a long time.
44,14,5,What can I say, I died a virgin.
48,13,5,I had a Groupon.
37,1,1,You're right, from the 1%.
35,0,0,What happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas?....ya right.
38,2,2,When I said I was a big Halo fan, I don't think they understood I was talking about the video game.
38,2,1,Yes, as a matter of fact, I did vote third party in 1996!
34,2,0,Of course, I will always treat you as an equal.
39,7,2,It just grows when I get excited.
37,3,0,This is nothing. You should see the Boss's mancave.
66,25,26,Excuse me. My eyes are down here!
43,6,3,Apparently it has something to do with my intellect.
39,5,1,You know what they say about a man with a large halo.
42,9,3,Well, size matters here too. Sorry.
38,4,0,Do you have faith that size matters?
39,2,1,I'm the patron saint of humblebragging.
38,1,2,Hashtag Halobrag.
49,18,10,If we haven't met before, it's likely because we travel in different circles.
37,3,0,Where were you all my life?
40,7,1,There is a reason for my holier than thou attitude.
39,6,1,Your halo is very, very low energy.
42,2,3,Still having an after life crisis huh Dave?
43,11,4,Me? I died saving a puppy.
38,5,0,My claim to fame was being inducted into The Hula-Hoop Hall of Fame.
43,13,2,My father is kind of a big wheel around here.
45,14,4,...which isn't to say that I'm NOT happy to see you
42,6,2,It's not the size, it's what's inside that counts
44,11,3,Halo. How are you?
51,15,8,You should see my harp.
44,7,3,Whaddya mean I don't have a prayer
39,5,1,I got nicknamed, 'Holier than Thou'.
40,2,2,Yep, up here we're all huge.
37,4,0,As you can tell by the size of my halo, I'm just not that kind of guy.
36,0,0,I found out "I'm a pilot" pick up line doesn't work up here.
54,37,15,If I hold my head just right, I can pick up basic cable.
33,0,0,Yeah, but so what?
38,3,1,Back in the day, I was the hula hoop champ in my neighborhood, so I guess it makes sense to kick it up a notch here.
38,5,1,Till death do us part seemed long enough to me.
58,26,14,they thought it would be funny because I fell down a manhole
37,2,1,It's been a while boo
38,1,1,So much for all those people who said the only problem with me is that my halo is too tight.
37,6,0,Nothing's a secret here, not even arousal.
37,5,0,Wow, it looked a lot smaller in your profile.
42,5,3,I was a hula hoop champion.
35,2,0,As a Boy Scout I did my duty to God and my Country.
34,3,0,It's not what you think................
38,3,2,I'm down 350 lbs postmortem, and I've never felt better!
47,14,2,But who had more fun?
50,21,6,It was my mistake. I gave them my head diameter in millimeters.
45,6,5,Just my luck! I'm incapable of having impure thoughts.
45,17,4,I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get here.
39,3,2,You know what they say about big halos...
37,3,1,I miss my Prius.
34,3,0,I cannot thank of anything to say "except" (is this a dream)???
55,5,4,Well, you know what they say? Big halo, big...
39,2,2,Gender inequality in heaven? Oh heavens!!
41,7,2,It is just the right size to double as a hula hoop.
38,1,1,That's one of the nice things. I mean, part of the beauty of me is that I'm very rich.
43,10,3,Why, halo there...
36,0,0,Salam! Are you one of the seventy-two virgins I was promised?
36,4,0,Not all angels are like that, actually.
35,3,0,"I see you did bigger good deeds then I did. No need to be a show off".
44,11,3,You were expecting halo equality?
49,7,10,Yes, I was responsible for ending Trump's campaign.
37,4,0,I bet a former New Yorker cartoonist made your halo?
39,7,0,Of course you've heard the old chestnut, "Big halo, big -----"
46,11,5,I took the garbage out
47,17,6,Can you tell I am happy to see you?
39,2,1,It's called a hula hoop halo
37,5,0,As I said, I guarantee there's no problem.
46,7,5,Well, I wouldn't say 'than most,' but certainly 'than thou...'
40,7,1,He forgives, but He hasn't really forgotten, has He?
37,6,0,Be not afraid. It'll shrink in the wash.
46,10,5,I still couldn't live up to my parents' expectations and now this.
38,3,0,No, it is not indicative of the size of anything else!
36,4,0,That's right; everything is proportional. And, yes, I am happy to see you.
37,4,1,...and he is wearing our new Donald J. Trump model halo..."The Narcissist".
37,2,0,You seem incredulous but Bill Cunningham said that big halos are a thing.
37,5,0,Especially in heaven, size matters.
35,1,0,But didn't you say size doesn't matter?
36,2,0,I apologize. Heaven knows why my order for a small,humble halo got switched to this horrendous hula hoop.
39,5,1,I'm on strict probation; one bad move and out I go through this hole above my head.
37,3,0,Well, yeah, and I have big hands, too - really big hands!
36,3,0,You got the hula-hoop on top of your head, right?
43,4,4,We have so much in common! Both headed our local Dump the Trump groups, both were murdered by Sig Sauer MCX owners, and NOW we're in the same New Yorker cartoon!
41,10,1,Well, actually, I was really quite modest.
43,12,2,I was a loophole lawyer.
42,3,3,Did you know that I was dying to meet you again?
39,3,1,I won the Hula Hoop competition three years in a row.
41,9,3,Yeah, I'm vegan...is it obvious?
39,7,1,I'm in the preventative virtue program.
37,5,0,We refer to it as the 'glass halo' effect.....
38,6,1,You know that thing about big hands? Well, it works for halos too.
40,8,1,I kept my social media posts to a minimum.
44,7,3,For what it's worth, size still matters.
52,6,8,You're waiting for the dick joke, aren't you?
45,5,4,Yeah, I lost mine, so Kanye let me borrow his.
43,8,3,I died doing what I love: hula hooping
39,2,1,Come on baby, you know what they say, 'small hands, big halo...'
37,3,0,That's right: big feet, big halo; everything else in proportion.
35,1,0,Yeah, the "one big part means..." line is what got me up here.
40,5,1,You know, it's true what they say about the size of a guy's halo.
34,3,0,Sorry- aureola, not areola.
40,3,1,He said "A ring or a prayer"
39,2,1,Yes, Helen, your mother was right. I spent too much time singing my own praises.
44,8,3,I had to redeem all my miles for it, but where else was I going to go?
44,11,3,No, nothing like that. It's just a hula hoop.
39,1,2,My hands are not small either
37,0,1,So much for breaking the glass ceiling!
37,0,0,"You know what they say about a big halo, right gorgeous?" Proving for all eternity that once a smarmy guy . . .
37,2,1,Sacred Supersizing
40,8,1,Is it perfect here or is it just you?
42,6,3,I've got the biggest one in paradise.
41,9,2,Guess what? Size really does matter.
42,3,4,Sure, now you say size doesn't matter!
41,3,2,Yeah, It is proportional to the size of my halo
44,15,3,Good luck at ring toss, I'm off to hula hooping.
41,9,1,Yes, there IS a correlation.
35,1,0,Girl, your halo looks like a hula hoop!
44,10,4,Hoola Hoop accident. And you?
36,4,0,Your's is not even 71% as big as mine.
45,13,3,It looked bigger on your profile.
40,2,2,"Yes, size is important!'
42,5,4,...and what makes you think I have a big ego?
36,0,1,Sorry, I'm really into the big "O".
41,3,2,Let me show you about venn diagrams
36,2,0,It is sort of like the size of your hands
41,5,1,SORRY, I'M A VIRGIN
39,3,1,That's nothing, you should see the size of my pineal gland.
37,2,1,I always wanted to practice hula hoop but I never had the time.
42,11,2,Please forgive my, "Holier than thou attitude."
43,13,3,Halo envy is fairly common.
38,2,0,You may know that the size of my halo is akin to the size of other parts of my anatomy.
43,11,2,I need to talk to a shrink.
35,0,1,Turns out what he actually said was that the meek would inherit wide girth.
43,11,2,Is that a hula hoop or are you just glad to see me?
45,9,3,Some of us are more equal than others.
39,4,1,Come on, Mom. I know you think it looks good, but I feel like a dork. All the other kids will make fun of me. Why can't I pick out my own halo?
40,9,2,What 'holier than thou' attitude are you talking about?
37,2,0,I'll let you wear the larger halo 'cause you have the male ego.
47,12,5,Well in all honesty, the guys at the gate called it a loop hole!
36,3,0,I left my modesty at the pearly gates.
40,3,2,I bet you wish you’d liked that post about the sick kid now, huh?
39,3,0,Actually, no; my halo size is not proportional to my tendency to 'mangelsplain.'
38,6,0,I always said that I was holier than you
39,5,1,I was even my mother's favorite.
44,12,5,I got a very high score on the entrance exam.
37,4,0,I guarantee you there's no problem. There's no problem.
38,2,1,If I were you, I would lose that attitude.
36,2,0,That's right, another glass ceiling mountain to climb. Don't worry, this time you have all eternity to get there.
37,4,1,"I swiped to the right and ended up here".
47,13,5,After four hours I'm supposed to call my doctor.
37,2,0,So much for the glass ceiling?
39,3,2,It must've been that little blue pill I took before I died.
42,7,2,An Oedipal victory and a lifetime of virtue...but that's enough about me. How'd you end up here?
38,3,0,Maybe it explains the small hands?
45,11,4,I'm happy to see you.
46,8,5,It's bigger than the Halo 5S, but it takes better pictures.
41,8,1,I am NOT trying to over compensate.
35,4,0,My sacrifices are bigger. My miracles are bigger. My, um....well... it's bigger.
35,0,0,Hey, Big Halo, wanna come fly with me? Let's fly, let's fly away down to Acapulco Bay.
36,1,0,Now, the thing most folks don't understand about the Black Afterlives Matter movement is...
55,16,13,It’s from the ‘Holier than Thou’ collection.
43,5,4,I cannot tell a lie.
41,10,2,Who says you can't take your elite mileage bonus with you?
37,6,0,I musta died and gone to heaven. Are all the men's halos this big?
43,5,3,A woman who asked for a boob job her first day in heaven shouldn't talk!
38,6,0,And you thought I was just being a wuss.
40,12,1,I was always a big kiss ass
37,2,0,Its size doesn't mean I want to lord it over you.
41,3,2,Once you reach 1 million rotations, you can swap out for the hula hoop.
42,5,2,Honestly, I hadn't noticed.
40,3,1,Well, if you worked as hard as I did, I'm sure your halo would be just as big.
37,5,0,Let's party.
56,26,15,I'm just glad to see you.
41,6,2,Up here, this is the white man's burden.
40,11,1,It's a macHalo.
41,8,1,Well the wings were marked, "One size fits all."
43,7,3,Well, you know what they say about a big halo.
42,3,2,Don't let the halo give you the wrong impression.
36,9,1,That's not what I meant by "size matters."
38,6,1,I lived and died in Texas and I always wore a ten gallon hat.
39,5,1,You'll love it here. There's no other gated community like it.
38,4,0,It's temporary since we're all equal here. Just a little recognition for what I had to put up with there.
48,15,5,You thought it would be different here?
38,8,0,I made it to this year's top five in humility.
43,7,2,I swear I'm not compensating for something else.
35,0,0,God only knows. But it must have something to do with the better angels of our nature.
40,6,1,My wings don't let me use my hula hoop.
34,2,0,Yeah, so, I've been working sort of behind the scenes on getting out the vote, particularly in areas traditionally underrepresented in the, you know, political arena, as well as. . . .
38,7,0,Lemme guess. On Earth you drove a muscle car.
38,4,1,I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee it.

36,5,0,You know what they say about guys with big halos? Big philanthropy.
38,4,1,Well, I was blessed with big hands.
37,7,2,White male privilege has nothing to do with it. I am just holier than you, God says so.
38,7,0,You know what they say about large halos, don't you?
39,4,1,The Bigger the Ring, The Better the Sting.
37,1,1,Sorry, Honey, even up here male chauvinism endures!

35,1,0,Too much goodness spoils its representation.
39,9,0,It's a symbol of the hoops through which I had to jump to get here.

41,6,2,It gives me the space I need to spread my wings.
41,5,1,Size doesn't matter in hell.
37,4,1,Down there they say you can tell by hand size, but up here, the bigger the halo, the bigger ...

43,5,3,With all the years I played Halo, I'm really not surprised.
40,1,2,Even in heaven women aren't equal.
