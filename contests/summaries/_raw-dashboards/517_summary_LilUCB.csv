Unfunny,Somewhat funny,Funny,Caption
3,1,0,You will need to convince the jury that you're sorry and will never do it again.
3,0,0,Great news. The judge has approved our plea bargain for the death penalty.
2,0,0,You need to know that the others find you somewhat standoffish
3,3,1,I'm fairly certain that you'll not get life.
3,0,1,Im not sure how to tell you this.... but they gave you death.
5,0,0,Nope, this is the Grim Sleeper trial.
4,0,0,"It's what I do" is not going to cut it as a defence.
3,1,0,Jury No. 3 has the same outfit!
9,1,2,I think we have a pretty good shot at a mistrial. You're scaring the crap out of the jurors.
4,0,0,I took this case Pro Bono.
3,0,0,Your the Special Investigator from the I.R.S. assign to me? Just my luck, Of course you are! Well about my Taxes.
5,1,0,Remember, what happened in the hood stays in the hood.
4,4,0,I'm sorry, the best I can get you is life.
3,1,0,I suggest we petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
7,0,0,Mr. Scrooge doesn't have a ghost of a chance. You can't sue for being frightened into giving everything to charity.
3,0,0,I told you not to wear your hoodie to court.
2,0,0,It is hard enough, did you have to wear that to court
3,0,0,You know I get paid on and hourly basis
5,0,0,Listen to me--can you say "so help me God"?
2,0,0,Tell them your part was inevitable.
2,0,0,We just need to stick to the story, ‘He was already dead when you got there.’
2,2,0,It's not looking good. They want to give you life.
2,0,0,You need to get that blank look off your face.
3,0,0,Yes, I know, but the prospect of global overcrowding is unlikely to get you a favorable verdict.
2,0,0,The Jury Hates Your Hoodie
3,1,0,Of course in your case the death penalty is not a viable option.
3,0,0,It looks pretty grim - how does manslaughter sound to you?
4,1,1,I don't think calling War, Pestilence, and Famine as character witnesses is going to help.
3,0,1,As co-counsel, I insist we seek the death penalty.
3,2,1,Yeah, just like that – keep staring at the jury.
4,0,0,Hoodies are not allowed in the courtroom
2,2,0,Stop laughing whenever they mention the death penalty.
5,1,0,I thought you understood --- this is Civil Court --- there's no jury, so we can ditch the theatrics.
3,2,1,No, the death penalty is a bad thing.
3,1,0,I think I get you life.
3,1,0,You really killed them in your cross-examination
3,0,0,We're going to be a caption for another lawyer joke.
2,0,0,They want a restraining order.
3,0,0,I know it's just a parking ticket, but you're still looking at manslaughter.
2,0,0,I don't think hiding the scythe is going to fool the jury.
3,0,1,“I say we plea bargin for the death penalty." - the Grim Reaper is actually the lawyer (my fave) or the other guy could be the lawyer (it's a two-for!).
3,1,0,I can't put you on the stand. We both know you killed him.
3,2,0,Not gonna lie, Mr. Reaper. It looks grim.
2,0,0,Lets keep it to ourselves that all your potential character witnesses pre-deceased you.
3,0,0,I can get you immunity, but only if you testify against the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
3,1,0,Don't you think you're getting a bit overzealous? It's only an embezzlement case,
3,0,0,Are you kidding me? It was your evil twin. THAT'S your defense?
2,2,0,We're all requesting a continuance
4,0,0,Do you want to plead as a corporation or a person?
3,2,2,Apparently, the 'open carry' law doesn't apply to scythes.
2,0,0,You're telling me you're against the death penalty?
3,3,1,I'm afraid the best we can hope for is life.
3,0,0,I'm hoping for the death penalty.
9,2,0,Don't worry, we'll put forward a spirited defense.
3,0,0,When I said 'Business Attire', I should've been clearer
5,1,0,We can't win without a body.
3,0,0,Yes, I suppose the death penalty isn't such a bad option.
4,0,0,To a jury, it's all about appeal, so please wear a coat and tie tomorrow.
3,1,0,Your image problem is killing us.
3,1,0,It looks grim, Reaper.
2,0,0,The prosecution is looking for a life sentence, I think we can get you death.
2,0,0,Normally I'd suggest you remove your hood but I think we'll make an exception today...
2,0,0,A life sentence? You're being ironic, right?
3,3,1,The hoodie isn't helping.
3,1,0,I would take the life sentence if I were you.
3,1,0,I think it's time to put a scare into juror number three.
3,1,0,The judge may perceive the death penalty as a conflict of interest.
2,0,0,I must have told them 100 times it tastes like concrete!
2,0,0,I'll ask for the death penalty, commuted to time served
3,0,0,Try to show off some bone so the jury can see you're white.
3,1,0,I guess if all else fails we can try the no face defense.
5,0,2,Look, I told you she'd take you to the cleaners in the divorce. Be happy you still have your job.
3,0,1,OK Grimm, please don't go ruin your defense by saying how soooo pro-death penalty you are.
3,0,0,I'm sorry, you're just not eligible for death row.
2,3,0,We are going to contend it was part of your job description.
3,0,1,After we close this case, I don't want to ever see you again, got it?
3,0,0,The facts aren't great but motive may be hard to prove
3,2,1,The jury has a sense of humour. They're suggesting life imprisonment.
8,1,0,Just be quiet, sit still, and try an look innocent...
5,1,0,Saying you were just doing your job won’t work.
3,0,0,See, I told you your sickle wouldn't make it through the metal detector.
3,0,0,Remember, all we have to prove is reasonable doubt
2,2,0,Next time, just let me ask the judge if we can strike the juror.
2,0,0,Now be nice! Remember the jurors are also future clients.
2,0,0,She meant literally ""til death do us part?"
4,0,0,Lose the hoodie if I put you on the stand.
7,0,0,Umm… Grim Reaper I'm not the right guy you're looking for. You see there's more men out there that are cheaper and I doubt you'll want me. Plus my girl always tells me I'm not a keeper, I think you'd probably want to see her, she's more of a weeper.
3,1,0,Just say you manage retirement plans.
2,0,0,I'm pretty sure I'm immune to the death penalty.
4,1,0,You don't think we can actually win, do you?
5,1,0,Death be not your name?
2,0,0,You need to cut a deal. Otherwise it's death without the possibility of parole.
3,0,0,Our best case scenario is that you get the death penalty.
8,0,0,The just-following-orders defense has not worked since the Nuremberg trials.
3,0,0,No, no... the other kind of habeas corpus.
3,1,0,What do you mean you didn't bring the scythe?! Great, the prosecution is just going to kill you up there.
3,0,0,It's not likely anyone will recognize you.
3,2,2,Stop pointing at the witnesses.
2,0,0,Be not proud—you need to look more sympathetic.
7,1,0,I see this isn't the first time you've faced life.
5,0,0,The prosecution will bargain if you swap kale for butter.
2,2,0,We can make the motion, but I'm pretty sure it's still going to be called life imprisonment.
4,3,0,Take my advice and don't smile at any of the jurors.
3,0,0,I don't think an appointment in Samarra works as an alibi.
3,0,0,The case against Taxes has been severed. It's just you now.
2,2,0,First we get the jury to like you.
2,0,0,In this case I'll be referring to you as "my client". Mr. Death may not play well with the jury.
2,2,0,Don't worry. Time is on our side.
3,0,0,The judge asks that you remove your hood.
3,2,1,Would it kill you to smile?
2,0,0,Probably a mistrial; we couldn't find a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,My advice? Lose the hoodie.
3,0,0,Really? Sure, I'll put you on the stand and you can beg for mercy, what have we got to lose.
5,2,1,Look, it's nothing personal, that's just what the penalty is called.
2,0,0,So...Let me get this straight. ,You want all the royalties from a song, using your name, which was sung in the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
3,1,0,Try not to mention anything about your past.
6,0,1,You might want to ditch the hoodie
3,3,3,Remember, you were only doing your job.
11,2,0,Our only defense is..the devil is in the details
2,0,0,We're going with the empty suit defense.
2,0,0,You're dead, right?
8,0,2,Damn. It's Prima facie. Death and taxes.
2,0,0,You're going to have to appear before the jury, okay?
2,0,0,If they sentence you to death, please don't gloat.
3,1,0,Life is the best we can hope for.
3,1,0,Bad news. Famine just turned state's witness.
3,1,0,Our only chance is if you can make eye contact with every juror.
3,1,0,Bad news, looks like your getting life...
2,0,0,We're not playing chess. This is a court room.
3,2,1,I don't think a jury trial is the best idea.
3,0,0,The best we can hope for is a hung jury.
2,0,0,You should have worn your "Make America Great Again," shroud.
4,0,1,With the number of prior convictions, I recommend you plead.
3,0,0,Didn't I tell you to wear the navy blue cardigan?
2,2,0,Don't worry. If the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit.
6,0,0,Not exactly what I meant when I said you had to face off with the Judge today....
2,2,0,As your counsel, I strongly advise you not to always close your statements with 'because I can'.
3,1,0,Is the death penalty fine with you?
3,1,0,Your attire might be a little grim.
4,0,0,I don't think wearing a hoodie to court was the smartest move.
5,1,0,You're lucky our firm does pro bono work.
4,0,0,Be not proud. Take the fifth.
2,0,0,I’m not sure that having you challenge the prosecutor to a chess match is a good idea.
3,0,0,You just can't face this, can you?
2,2,0,Wait - I thought I was here to defend you.
3,0,1,Your request for a chess match has been denied.
3,0,0,The best we can hope for is life.
2,5,2,Relax, without the scythe they don't have a case.
3,0,0,Unfortunately, it's a capital offence.
4,1,1,Now, whenever I object, I want you to give an innocent look to the jury.
2,5,2,I keep telling you, "It's what I do," is not a viable defense.
3,2,1,We haven't discussed this yet, but I'm open to bartering when it comes to my fee.
3,1,0,The prosecution is now claiming your DNA is all over the scythe they found at the scene.
2,2,0,Only YOU could think the death penalty is a slap on the wrist.
4,1,0,I think we can do better than the death penalty for a traffic violation.
2,2,0,We're having some trouble finding impartial jurors.
3,0,0,C'mon man, you know I can't allow you to shake hands with the Prosecution.
3,0,0,I am here for the writ of habeas corpus.
2,0,0,As you are quite aware, you don't have a chance.
3,0,1,It'd really help if you stopped dressing like that.
2,0,0,Not even the "Dream Team" could have had your priors expunged.
5,0,0,The hoodie makes you look guilty.
2,0,0,You've got a lot of counts against you.
3,0,0,You have the right to remain faceless.
3,1,0,They're seeking the life penalty
2,2,0,The bad news is they have a lot of witnesses against you - the good news is none of them are available to testify.
2,0,0,The families of your D-Train and cinder block murders are suing you for millions.
5,0,0,Just remember, you're the defense.
2,0,0,'I'm entering a guilty plea,the Scythe had your DNA all over it."
3,0,0,Legally, I don't see a way out of this.
3,1,0,No, I think we can plea it down to a life sentence.
3,0,1,He's going to ask for whom the bell tolls. Whatever you do, don't answer!
3,1,0,Can I testify on my behalf?
3,1,0,Your chances would improve if you wore a tie.
6,1,0,Remember now, "repossessing," "repossessing," not "Reaping."
3,0,0,You reaper what you sower
2,0,0,The worst they can give is the you-penalty!
4,0,0,It might seem black and white to you, but the judge will never go for no chess players on the jury.
4,0,0,I really think that holding onto your scythe would give the jury the wrong idea.
3,1,0,Because I think if we bring up your zombie days you'l have a better chance.
3,0,0,With this plea, we can get you life in prison instead of the death sentence.
2,0,0,My recommendation is to take the three souls.
4,1,2,Try to make eye contact with the jurors
3,0,0,Remember, when they swear you in, you can't say 'Lucifer !'
3,0,0,Ironic. Noooo, really? I get it, genius.
3,0,0,Look at the bright side, they named your penalty after you.
2,0,0,Hey, you're early and as you can see, we're just getting started here. You must have caught the red eye in from Huntsville this morning.
2,0,0,I recommend we show them the death penalty.
2,0,0,Apparently we did need to make a distinction between 'Reaper' and 'Reapist'
2,2,0,It's not me who's on trial here, Mr. Reaper.
3,1,1,The prosecution rests in peace.
2,0,0,Good lord, that's a terrible alibi.
4,2,3,For Chrissakes, stop looking jurors in the eye.
3,0,0,The judge said the death penalty is an option.
3,0,0,Be sure to peer earnestly at the jury.
4,0,0,At this point, I think you should take the deal.
2,0,0,Remember Mr. Reaper, you went to the movies alone on the night of January 9th.
2,0,0,You had better leave the jury challenges to me in the future.
2,0,0,At least we have precedent on our side.
3,1,0,I think we have a better chance if we go with your middle name - Larry Reaper'
3,0,0,Again, that's not what we mean by habeas corpus.
2,0,0,No, this state does not have the death penalty.
5,0,0,Don't worry. I'll get you the death sentence.
8,0,0,Can you wait until next month? These character witnesses will turn this case around.
3,1,0,Try not to sneeze. It only annoys the jurors.
3,1,0,No, they won't give you the death penalty for tax evasion.
5,1,1,When the Prosecution asks you to take the stand, do that evil laugh thing.
2,0,0,I'm fighting for your life here!
2,0,0,Array suit with a blue tie might have been better
4,0,0,Did you do it?
7,2,0,"We need to produce a witness who was with you that day".
4,0,0,You couldn't have worn something a little less grim for my first trial?
4,0,0,I suppose the death penalty won’t be a problem for you.
4,0,0,Poker face! POKER FACE!
5,2,0,Wait, I'm getting life? This should be interesting.
5,0,0,Remember, this jury does NOT appreciate 'Gallows Humour'...
2,0,0,Trust me, you'll look less guilty with glasses.
2,0,0,Before he rules, the judge wants to discuss a deal. With you.
2,0,0,Let me get this straight .. I am the evil sorcerer here
3,1,0,Ok, we’ll make a go at it, but you shouldn't really count on a sympathetic jury.
2,0,0,To a jury, death doesn't become you.
3,0,0,I don't think changing your name from "Grim" to "Wonderful" is going to influence the jury.
2,0,0,Well, yes, if one more juror dies it will be a mistrial. Why do you ask?
2,5,2,I thought I asked you to wear a tie...
2,0,0,Replacing Garland with you was a brilliant move - we thought you might be able to "convince" Republicans to hold a confirmation hearing!
3,0,0,Relax, imposing the death penalty would be ridiculous.
3,1,0,You are the Grim Reaper." "Well this time, I'm innocent, so prove it, or you will be my next victim.
8,0,0,You know, we don't have a ghost of a chance, don't you?
3,0,0,Well, looks like this case will be the death of me.
2,0,0,Motion denied.
2,0,0,Don't be worried. We have her prior statement that you kindly stopped for her.
2,2,0,I'd say your best bet is to remain silent.
3,0,1,Insider training IS a faceless crime.
3,0,0,The ultimate tweet has been tweeted.
3,1,0,Show your compassionate side.
2,2,0,Gasp! The hood fits.
4,0,0,To tell you the truth, you've got bupkis.
3,0,0,How many times have I told you to lose the hoodie?
3,1,0,They want you to serve life.
4,0,2,You have no witnesses. No one has ever come back from the dead.
8,0,0,That doesn't sound like good advice!!
2,0,0,Of course our services are complementary ... as a matter of professional courtesy.
2,0,0,Of course security is going to take your reaper. I think the jury will recognize you anyway.
3,0,0,I know your the Grim Reaper, but do you have to wear that outfit in court?
4,0,1,Not your actual work suit - a suit you would wear to work.
4,0,1,Unfortunately that's not what they mean by habeus corpus.
6,0,0,Should I bill your corporate or personal account?
2,0,0,If the sickle doesn't show, you must let go!
3,0,0,Your only help is to plead, "Guilty as Hell!"
2,0,0,You think you have everyone fooled but I can see right through you!
5,1,0,I understand you are cold, but, in this case, a sweater would have been a better choice.
3,1,0,Don't worry, I'm going to get you the death penalty.
2,0,0,Don't worry, we can appeal his death penalty verdict.
3,0,1,When the prosecution says it "rests," stop saying "in peace" afterwards.
1,0,0,Wait, you name is Tom?
3,0,0,It's a little late for that now, but I get mine from Jos. A. Banks.
3,1,0,Gender bias is the least of our problems.
4,0,0,My hunch is the most submitted caption will be: "Could you act a little less grim?"
3,1,0,You may be the Grimm Reaper, but it's still Murder 1.
2,0,0,I get the feeling that everyone else in the courtroom is just for show.
3,0,0,If you want to appeal, I need another 100 souls as a retainer.
3,0,0,I would really advise against the 'it was his time anyway' defense.
2,0,0,Good news. The judge is an existentialist.
2,0,0,We're good to go for now, but later, to save face, you'll have to show yours in order to win this thing.
3,1,1,I advise you to stop pointing at members of the jury.
5,1,0,You’re my first client to request the death penalty.
2,0,0,I'd ask you to speak for yourself, but I see that's impossible.
2,2,0,The death penalty is off the table, not that it matters.
3,0,0,Yes, wearing a hoodie could hurt you with this jury, but it's your call
2,0,0,Some help, offering to do the jurors' taxes.
2,2,0,Frankly, I don't think we have a ghost of a chance.
5,0,0,Like I said, nothing is dead certain.
2,1,1,I've been meaning to ask you if you're hoody is by YEEZY?
4,0,0,Finally, a proper attorney.
3,0,0,But it's only a parking ticket.
2,0,0,Just be thankful they're not asking for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Worst case? 50 to Life.
4,0,0,It's never been tried before, but we're going with a raison d'etre defense.
3,0,0,I think we should plead the death penalty.
2,0,0,Have one of your friends make a visit to Juror #9
3,1,0,You get weekends and Easter.
3,1,0,Your look is not helping our case.
3,0,0,it does not matter how you cloak it
3,0,1,Frankly, I think you should accept the plea bargain and opt for life.
2,0,0,Your prospects appear grim, Mr. Reaper.
6,0,0,We got this
3,0,1,When I call you to the stand, leave the scythe under the table, OK?
3,0,0,The public has a bad perception of us lawyers
2,0,0,I know Mr. Reaper, but I don't think you should remind the jury that everyone dies.
2,0,0,Give me an acquittal or give me death.
3,2,0,Stop it. I’ll handle jury selection.
2,0,0,Look, it's an all-white jury. Ditch the hoodie!
2,0,0,Government security aside, Apple might cooperate more if you were a little more transparent.
3,2,1,A lot of people are dying to see how this case turns out.
2,0,0,Is you-know-what still on the table?
2,0,0,On second thought, I really don't think it's a great idea to call Taxes as a character witness.
2,0,0,Is that a new style huddie with a tail!
2,0,0,Good news .... they're offering life.
3,0,0,This is serious. You could be facing the you penalty.
2,0,0,When Her Honor recesses for lunch, we need to get you a tie!
3,0,0,Trust me, the jury thinks they are already in Hell.
4,0,0,Great news, the prosecutor is going for the death penalty.
2,2,0,If your found guilty you could get life.
4,0,0,You never know who the true person you are defending is.
3,2,1,The IRS case against you is weak, but nothing's certain ...
4,1,0,Well, they're giving you life.
5,1,1,It's looking grim, Reaper.
5,0,0,Just to confirm: you are NOT taking the stand.
3,0,0,You are not required to 'appear' before the Court.
3,1,0,Try to be more upbeat when you take the stand.
4,0,0,"I was hoping for a hung jury, not a dead one!'
3,0,0,I thought you said you were deaf.
2,0,0,...and you are?
3,0,0,Don't be empty headed. Take the settlement!
6,1,0,I'm hoping for a hung jury
2,0,0,This case might last an eternity.
3,3,1,I wish you'd gone to Brooks Brothers like I'd suggested.
3,1,0,To be honest, I've never handled a death penalty case before.
2,0,0,Habeus corpus? What's that?
2,0,0,I'm not sure the jury is going to like you.
2,0,0,My fee is 100 an hour and I don't see you any time soon.
4,1,1,You keep saying hung jury like it's a good thing.
3,1,0,If you were the devil, we could create sympathy.
3,0,0,Trite or not, the wardrobe malfunction defense is your best chance.
3,1,1,For the last time, It was His Time, is not a viable defense
2,0,0,This trial is killing me.
2,3,0,Fortunately, there are no witnesses.
4,1,2,Don't mention your day job.
3,1,0,And keep calm on the stand; remember: no scythe, no proof.
2,2,0,If the hood doesn't fit, they must acquit.
3,1,1,You look like death.
7,0,0,I'm a huge fan of your early work.
3,0,0,Looks like your going to miss your tee time, the judge is keeping the death penalty on the table.
4,0,0,Do you have any character references who can testify?
3,0,0,Relax. This judge has never sentenced someone to the you penalty.
4,0,0,Stereotypically speaking, this is not a good look.
2,0,0,"For the 100th time, no, that hoodie does not make you look fat!'
2,0,0,Wait, define "disorderly conduct."
3,0,0,Visa of MasterCard, No Discovery
3,0,0,It's not as grim as it seems.
3,0,1,Relax, there is no Life penalty in Texas.
3,0,0,I realize your a Public Defender, but could you at least dress more optimistically?
2,0,0,I know what you're thinking, but that's not what a "hung jury" means.
2,0,0,Dressing business casual may not help our case.
2,0,0,No, I don't think a demonstration would help your case right now.
2,0,0,I also represent the IRS
3,0,1,I'm willing to try a plea bargain of life in prison, but I don't think the judge will buy it.
3,0,0,No. No. No. I want it as much as you do, but there's no way we can ask for the death penalty in the Trump University case.
3,0,0,Ok, fine. I'll plead the 5th.
3,1,0,Bad news. You're getting a life sentence.
5,0,0,Ubiquity isn't going to work as an alibi.
3,1,0,I told you not to wear that outfit for the trial.
5,2,0,I'm having trouble reading your lips.
3,0,0,And, naturally, your taxes.
3,0,0,If the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit.
2,0,0,Grim reaping is punishable by death.
2,0,0,You don't exactly have an innocent face
3,0,0,You were involved in 9/11 too? That's it! I'm the only one who would take your case, so if you want to beat this then from now on, you tell me everything.
2,0,0,The good news is, you'll get capital punishment.
3,1,0,I'm pinning our hopes on re-branding.
3,0,0,I'll have you out of here by lunch Mr.Trump.
3,0,0,Let's pivot to a climate change defense.
3,2,2,No, I'm sorry, you cannot execute yourself
5,0,0,They're going to try to pin you on motive, but just play it cool. The prosecution has nothing on you.
3,1,0,Really?
5,2,0,The Devil made you do it? That could be a defense!
7,0,0,I'd take the plea if I were you.
3,1,0,I don't think we have to worry about them seeking the death penalty
3,1,0,Know anything about a scythe?
2,0,0,Are you here for death or taxes?
3,3,1,Look, you're staring death in the face here.
2,0,0,"I'm trying to make sure there are no widows on the jury".
2,0,0,Be transparent.
3,0,0,HOW many priors?
2,0,0,Grim, is what I would consider your chances of successfully arguing against the death penalty Mr. Reaper.
2,0,0,I think your only defense is to take the stand and sing You Can Call Me Al.
3,0,0,Yes, but in the legal system, you need to make them whole.
2,0,0,What's the downside? Offer is the Death Sentence.
2,0,0,If the sickle doesn't fit, they must acquit.
3,0,0,Death penalty is off the table.
2,0,0,Now? Seriously? ... Boo who?
4,0,0,I hope the judge sees the irony in sentencing you to death.
7,1,0,I'm claiming you were only doing your job.
3,1,0,So the deal is I'll get you probation if you give me another 60 years. And you do something about my mother-in-law.
2,0,0,There's no way the jury will vote not guilty. I suggest a plea bargain.
3,0,0,How about twenty to life?
2,0,0,Would wearing a suit and a tie to court kill you?
5,0,0,Give me back my daughter, just for one more day
3,0,0,Yea, I know, kind of ironic – they’re pushing for the death penalty.
2,0,0,You're looking at life, would you settle for that?
2,0,0,Tell me again what happened to your first two attorneys?
2,0,0,The right to face your accusers requires a little something on your part.
3,0,0,Death becomes you, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
3,2,1,Remember: the death was consensual.
3,0,0,Famine has turned state's evidence.
2,0,0,You look like you've seen a ghost.
3,0,1,We can't excuse those who oppose the death penalty. You are the death penalty.
4,0,0,I'm expecting the life penalty
3,3,2,Look, I'll do my best, but you should have paid your taxes.
5,1,0,I prefer my clients to show more optimism!
2,0,0,Technically, death is a penalty.
2,0,0,The death penalty. You have to appreciate the meta.
3,1,1,Insider trading...? Really?
2,0,0,hey whats up
3,0,0,Are you for or against the death penalty?
3,0,0,This is not a sympathetic jury
2,0,0,It didn't work for Lt. Calley.
2,0,0,As your counsel, I strongly advise you to ditch the hoodie.
3,0,0,Where's my client?
3,0,0,In this instance of identity theft, we have an excellent shot at a necessity defense
2,1,0,Putting on a good face is critical.
5,1,0,I’m not sure if it’s irony or synergy, but I started out as a tax attorney.
3,0,0,Sir, if you insist on wearing that hoodie, they're definitely going to think you killed all those people.
3,0,1,It's The People vs. the Undertaker. There's no way they win.
4,0,0,Yes, they were all dead when I got there. All 107 billion of them.
3,1,0,So what part of 'my client has nothing to hide' didn't you understand?
2,2,0,Tie! I asked you to please wear a tie.
3,1,0,No, killing the judge right now would not be looked upon favorably by the jury.
3,1,0,C'mon, man . . . the trial hasn't even started!
2,0,0,Let's call you The Angel of Involuntary Manslaughter.
3,2,1,I'm not suggesting anything, but juror #7 has a heart condition.
3,1,0,Mr. Reaper, I would advise against you taking the stand in your own defense.
7,3,0,In your case the death penalty is probably moot.
2,2,0,You don't have any lips, so let me do the talking. Let me do the talking.
3,1,1,The Force is not with you on this.
2,0,0,"May I call you 'Grim?'l
3,1,0,Trust me. 'Wardrobe malfunction' is not the best way to go.
3,1,0,It would really help your case if you could remember where you left your scythe.
5,0,2,If this were Texas, the "He needed killing" defense might have worked.
3,0,0,But I wasn't wearing a disguise.
3,2,2,So if I win this case, I'm off the hook?
3,0,0,Your hood not fitting is a valiant, but poor, attempt at an aquittal.
2,0,0,No, I don't think that telling the judge that you were responsible for the death of all people since the beginning of time has helped our defense.
3,0,0,You really thought you could get away with tax evasion?
3,0,0,Keep in mind that you did kill, well, everyone ever.
4,1,2,I know you were just doing your job,, but the judge's wife?
3,0,1,Well, one' thing's for sure. We don't have to worry about the death penalty.
2,1,0,I'm pretty sure that would be contempt of court.
3,1,1,I'm sorry Mr. Reaper, but your chances of an acquittal are grim
3,0,0,Frankly, I don't want you as my lawyer.
2,0,0,When you get up there, just remember to plead the scythe.
3,1,0,Tell him you have a vow of silence.
2,2,0,So, let's assume the death penalty is off the table...
3,0,0,Remember, if they ask for whom the bell tolls, take the fifth.
3,0,0,Let's try for a technicality.
3,1,0,Just when did you first realize that you were dead?
2,0,0,My guess is that his first ploy will be to ask for a postponement.
3,1,0,Two things - I think you should take the stand, and what was Elvis like?
3,1,0,The jury might be more sympathetic if you didn't insist on wearing that hoodie.
3,1,0,Is that business formal where you come from?
3,1,0,I suggest a habeas corpus defense.
5,1,5,Sure, a hung jury would be great for us. Why do you ask?
3,1,0,Life is certainly not on the table.
3,0,0,Don't worry - in this state, there's no death penalty.
2,0,0,Ready, Mr. Durst?
2,2,0,The last thing you need to worry about is a death sentence.
3,2,0,Don't worry...the death penalty is off the table, the most you can get is life.
3,0,0,Let's ask for the death sentence. It's our only chance to retain any control of the outcome.
2,3,0,Were you being honest when you said you didn't kill him?
2,0,0,If you're lucky, you'll get life.
5,0,0,How many death penalty cases have you won again?
3,1,1,And to think, they called me an empty suit!
3,0,0,The good news is they aren't asking for the death penalty...
2,0,0,You got "life." Tragic, yes, but amusingly ironic.
3,1,0,I have to advise you to keep a low profile.
2,2,0,Now would be a good time to show a little emotion.
4,4,5,Don't worry. We were able to dig up a couple of witnesses.
2,2,0,No, you cannot threaten the jury.
2,0,0,Agree to the Settlement. When Life is exhausted, you can take them.
3,1,0,You should face the jury before they vote.
3,0,0,I thought we agreed that you wouldn't wear your hoodie to court!
2,0,0,I wouldn't use that alibi.
4,0,2,You don't recollect, only collect. You may evoke the scythe.
3,3,2,There's no way they can prove it's your scythe.
3,1,0,I already have a death sentence.
3,0,0,I KNOW it says a 'jury of your peers', but ...
3,0,1,I must warn you. Juries never find disappearing acts convincing,
8,1,0,I don't intend to put you on the stand.
7,1,0,Law and Order: Cybersecurity Unit
7,0,0,You're sure she was wearing that same tulle tippet when got out of your carriage?
2,2,0,I asked you to not wear the hoodie.
2,0,0,"Remember, don't smile"!
2,0,0,What about the penalty, Death?
3,1,0,We will do better without Juror #3, if you know what I mean...
2,0,0,You could throw yourself on the mercy of the court?
3,1,0,Try to smile when you're on the stand.
5,0,0,As a demonstration of good faith, they've agreed to take death off of the table if you'll promise to do the same.
2,0,0,And if I lose my case?
3,1,0,With 107,602,707,791 counts of manslaughter against you, I recommend you take the plea bargain.
4,0,0,Look innocent; nobody suspects that you killed him.
3,0,0,Groan once for yes, twice for no.
3,0,0,We’re hoping for life.
3,0,0,Was it the hoodie?
2,2,0,Remember, you were just doing your job.
4,0,0,Looks like you've made it to Death Row again.
2,0,0,The death penalty is on the table?
5,1,0,Do you really think I'm worried about the death sentence?
3,1,0,No, you can't strike all the jurors.
3,2,1,We're going to need a better argument than "It was his time."
10,1,0,Okay - it looks like we're stuck with the reaping, but could you be a little less grim?
3,0,0,"It's my job" is not a defense.
4,0,0,So, what brings you here?
3,1,0,the good news is that you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
2,0,0,For the umpteenth time, its YOUR life on the line, not mine.
2,0,0,My client invokes his right to habeas corpses.
3,0,1,They're sentencing you to ten years in paradise.
2,0,0,It's best if you remain silent about your occupation.
2,0,0,Don't mention.the kissing
3,0,0,So that's your defense? Because she could not stop for you, you kindly stopped for her?
2,0,0,Try not to look like a death threat.
2,0,0,I specialize in tax law, but there's a lot of overlap.
4,1,2,It's probate court. Your here as the "executor" not the "executioner".
5,0,0,Mr. Crane, at some point you have to face the facts.
2,0,0,Somehow I don't think this jury is going to go for the death penalty.
4,0,0,Our basic defense is, it was too dark to see a damn thing.
4,1,0,Of course, for you death isn't a penalty.
3,0,0,I told you not to wear a hoodie in that neighborhood.
2,0,0,Can you get the death sentence off the table?
2,0,0,Judge: The scythe is inadmissible. Lawyer to Death: We got this in the bag. Death to Judge: I'll need that back.
3,0,1,So it's not technically a hoodie. It still gives the jury an impression of menace.
3,0,1,The death penalty is definitely on the table.
2,2,0,They're arguing that the plaintiff's life was not yours to take.
2,0,0,They're offering thirty-to-life.
5,0,0,Your not here because of that stuff. You're here because you didn't pay your taxes.
7,1,1,It seems the witnesses are all deceased.
3,1,0,Couldn't you at least try to look contrite and remorseful?
2,0,0,Would you like to meet my mother-in-law?
3,0,0,Life-sentence does not mean what you think it means.
3,1,0,Well, sure, why not? Go ahead and testify. They won't know who you are anyway.
3,1,1,The State of Texas cannot execute you a second time.
3,1,0,I think your "It's my job!" explanation is your best bet.
3,1,0,No I don't think you should take the stand!
3,0,0,Nothing personal, but I prefer a different court appointed attorney.
3,3,1,I don't think you're giving off the best first impression.
4,0,0,I'd put you on the stand but the jury will see right through you.
4,0,0,It was difficult to find a jury of your peers, but we think the easter bunny will lean in our direction.
2,0,0,I can get a continuance if you think it might help.
2,1,0,Let's make sure I understand. You want the death penalty.
3,1,0,This will be the biggest serial killer trial ever.
3,2,2,We're trying to get you life.
4,0,0,You might have a chance. All your witnesses are dead.
2,0,0,What about our 'right to life' issue?
3,0,0,Grim reaper, I think we have an excellent case against death and taxes
7,0,0,I don't think that the hood does anything for your case, Jerry.
3,1,0,That guy behind you is kinda making me nervous.
2,2,0,Case deceased.
2,2,0,I don't understand. YOU are the statute of limitations.
7,0,0,Not to worry. They don't have prima facial evidence.
2,0,0,They won't seek the death penalty, they can't promote suicide.
2,2,0,They can't prove a thing without the scythe.
4,1,0,Yes, chess is more thematic, but much less legally binding.
3,1,0,Listen, can you get me out of this profession?
4,0,0,There is no way this year gets any worse.
6,1,0,We're breaking new ground, but I've handled a lot of wrongful death cases.
2,0,0,They want the death penalty.
2,0,0,Maybe we should just ask for life.
4,1,0,Remember, your an actuary, not Death, plays much better with the jury.
3,0,1,Income tax evasion? Really?
9,1,0,Just plead not guilty, and try to look innocent
3,0,0,You're just an empty suit.
3,1,0,Which jury member?
2,2,0,The judge has to sentence you to death or life in prison. Either way, you're OK.
3,0,0,I can get you life without parole.
3,0,0,You want to plead "inevitability"? Are you sure?
3,1,0,I'm not sure self-defense is our best option here.
2,3,0,Bad news. Their attorney is Daniel Webster.
2,2,0,Traditionally, you don't show up until after the governor denies clemency.
3,1,0,The defense rests in peace, your honour.
3,0,0,I think we have a solid case for a decision to award royalties from The New Yorker.
3,0,0,Wipe that smile off your face. It's looking grim for you.
2,0,0,Don't worry, I'm the best wrongful death lawyer in the county.
2,3,0,I don't know what will happen if the judge sentences you to life.
4,2,3,Ironically, you are looking at life
3,1,0,The governor is willing to grant you clemecy if you agree to visit Bernie first thing.
2,0,0,I'm expecting another hung jury.
7,0,0,Do you have a less prejudicial outfit?
7,2,0,We're okay. The Court has confirmed the right to bear scythes.
2,0,0,I convinced the judge that the death penalty would create a conflict of interest.
3,0,0,I don't think we have to worry about a death sentence.
4,0,0,SORRY, THIS'LL TAKE LONGER THAN THAT.
3,1,0,In your case habeas corpus is more figurative.
3,1,0,First time in probate court?
3,0,1,I think I have a conflict of interest.
2,0,0,Didn't I ask you to wear a softer color?
2,0,0,Relax, "death penalty" is just a figure of speech.
3,1,0,I can't be anymore clear, do not shake hands with the judge.
3,1,0,Our defense will be the law's religious exemption.
3,0,0,Are you stalking me?
3,3,1,Ironically, you could get Life....
4,0,0,But I don't understand. You said to wear my suit
2,2,0,I think our best chance is to claim racial profiling. We should be able to get the 'black guy in a hoodie' description thrown out.
3,1,0,No, that's not what I meant by "the jury is deadlocked."
3,1,0,Best case we get a hung jury
3,0,0,Don't stare, but don't avoid eye contact with the jury.
3,1,0,They've dropped the murder charges, but the tax evasion charges stuck.
3,1,1,You're not doomed.
3,0,0,There seems to be consensus in the jury that the death penalty in this case would not be an issue..
4,0,0,It appears your 1099 neglected to mention all you reaped in 2015.
3,1,0,When you testify be sure to face the jurors.
2,2,0,Didn't you get the suit I left with your doorman?
2,0,0,I thought this was a sentence you would be comfortable with . . .
2,0,0,All the evidence indicates that the defendant did indeed cheat you.
2,0,0,No need to worry Prime Minster Camaron. This is just the hearing for the Panama Papers.
3,1,0,The death penalty isn't much of a plea bargain.
3,1,0,Keep it up and the outcome will be grim, too.
3,1,0,Frankly, grim does'nt cut it.
2,2,0,Inevitability and taxes are not the best legal strategy.
2,0,0,When I say valley of shadows, you say supermarket.
3,1,0,It's a wrongful death suit.
4,3,3,I might be able to get you life.
2,0,0,Just as I suspected...it is a capital offense
2,0,0,I told you from the start, should of become a doctor.
3,0,0,Umm, that whole "I am not the one who pleads" thing probably didn't help your case.
2,2,0,I told you not to wear a hoodie to court.
3,1,0,Look, I'm the editor of this magazine, and I get to say which stories get killed. Case dismissed.
2,0,0,I can reassure you, that is no precedent second time for death role.
3,0,1,The case is looking pretty grim.
2,0,0,You do realize that you're facing life, right?
2,2,0,Please don't tell the sentencing judge that you're a long term advocate of the death penalty.
2,0,0,Remember, you can't reap while under oath.
5,0,0,Don't touch me, Grim!
3,2,1,I'ts Your Honor not you're next !
2,0,0,I can't find any character references for you...
2,0,0,You could plead ignorance, but it is the other certainty in life.
6,1,0,Sure, they're pursuing the death penalty. But frankly, I don't see how they're going to follow through.
2,0,0,They're sentencing you to you.
2,2,0,Not to worry. They don't call him the hanging judge for nothing.
2,0,0,Sorry, but there is a strict no hat rule.
3,0,0,Your identity change is perfect. No worries.
2,2,0,How about, “His hands are so brittle; you must vote acquittal”?
2,2,0,My job is to get you outta here alive.
3,1,0,Tax evasion? I mean, you of all people.
2,2,0,It's going to be tough—the IRS is as certain of their case as we are of ours.
3,1,0,We just have to convince the jury you were on holiday.
3,0,0,If this is your idea of "saving face" then yes, I'd say the outlook's pretty Grim.
2,0,0,I think they're going for the death penalty.
3,0,0,Juror 3 won't be back after lunch?
2,2,0,I don't think anyone has ever plea bargained FOR the death penalty.
2,0,0,Look, if you just leave, I'll cut you in for half of my contingent fee.
3,0,0,Talk about a dead-to-rights case.
2,0,0,It would help your case if you took off that robe.
3,1,0,You're killing me here.
2,0,0,If you plead guilty, they'll wipe the points and you'll only have to pay a fine.
3,0,0,I know you did it, they know you did it, but for know just play it cool.
3,1,0,Well, I wouldn't have chosen it but then again, I'm not guilty.
2,0,0,If you loose, you get life.
3,1,0,They had it coming
3,0,0,No. I don't think telling them that it's your job is a good idea.
2,6,1,You want a change of venue? How's Pluto? Is Pluto good?
3,0,1,Don't worry, you're not the most guilty person I've defended.
2,0,0,You say it's pronounced "Deeth?"
5,0,0,I said 'sole' defense - not 'soul' defense.
3,0,0,Their witness may try to throw some shade.
3,1,0,Is there something about losing a chess game that you didn't tell me about?
2,0,0,Don't look at me like that. You're the one who said you don't have fingerprints.
3,0,0,Good news! I think he's going to give you the death penalty.
5,0,0,I see . . I see . . I don't really see . .
4,0,0,So you are sayo that you want the death penalty !?
2,0,0,I hate to tell you this, but things are looking pretty grim.
4,0,0,They've offered a deal. Plead guilty to four billion counts of murder and they'll drop the rest of the charges ...
2,0,0,Would it kill you to at least pretend to feel remorseful?
2,0,0,How about going forward I handle the jokes.
3,0,0,You have the right to remain silent, but it'll look like you're hiding something.
3,1,0,Your tonsure is telling
3,0,0,Couldn't you have picked a better outfit to show the jury?
3,0,0,Because your robe fits; you might as well call it quits!
2,0,0,We have to make you appear likable.
3,0,0,It doesn't help that you look like hell.
2,2,0,I think plea bargaining for "life" would be pushing it.
2,0,0,The firm has been working me to death.
2,2,0,Of course they took it away from you. What do you expect? You just harvested half the jury.
3,0,0,He said rise, not scythe.
3,2,0,Remember, no eye contact with the jury.
3,1,0,How do you feel about ankle bracelets?
3,1,0,Pro bono, not pro bone.
5,1,0,You know that wearing a hoodie leads to an automatic conviction.
3,0,0,This case is a killer.
2,0,0,No, you cannot hang the jury.
2,0,0,Seriously? A hoodie?
2,0,0,I still think a jacket and tie might help your defense
2,2,0,I can see the headline now: Death Gets Life
2,0,0,The jury was unsympathetic to your testimony of 'sucking air from their souls'
3,0,0,Maybe it would have been better if you had not said, "Hey, it's my job".
4,0,1,I don't think parole is an option here, buddy.
3,1,0,Try not to giggle if they give you the death penalty.
3,1,0,Habeas Corpus not Rigor Mortis
2,0,0,It's a good thing we're not in Texas
2,0,0,What was that other thing besides taxes?
2,0,0,Your wardrobe choice tells me that you don’t fully grasp the death penalty laws in this state.
3,0,0,Listen...you've GOT to give me your real name!
4,1,1,Just play dead - I'll do all the talking..
4,0,0,The bad news - this is not a class action suit. The good news - the death penalty is off the table, suicide is against the law.
2,2,0,And for Pete's sake, don't make eye contact with anyone on the jury.
2,0,0,I've got some bad news, Mr Reaper. They've taken the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,So, you've decided to plead guilty with an explanation?
1,0,0,No jury tampering. Besides illegal, your methods are a little obvious.
2,0,0,You're safe - this state supports the death penalty.
2,0,0,They want the You Penalty.
2,0,0,It doesn't look good--the sentence for open carry of a scythe is from here to eternity.
3,0,0,Are you referring their homes as legal pads?
3,0,1,I think I can get them down to afterlife without parole.
2,0,0,It wouldn't have killed you to put on a coat and tie.
4,0,0,I can plead you down to eternity, with a few years off for good behavior.
10,0,0,You can't refuse to incriminate yourself if you don't have a self to incriminate.
3,1,0,Max von Sydow refused to be a character witness.
2,0,0,Usually the jury doesn't reach a verdict this fast. Could be good?
3,2,2,Are you the habaes or the corpus?
4,0,0,Well yes ... there will be hell to pay. But how much? ... and can we talk them down?
2,0,0,Remember what I told you. You don't know anything about Christmas future, and you've never seen that Scrooge guy before the trial.
5,3,2,It's evidence; you'll get the scythe back after the trial.
2,0,0,In this case, what you reaped sued you.
2,0,0,To be honest, you look like a good candidate for the death penalty.
3,0,0,Hello. Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?
3,1,1,They're starting to run out of prosecutors.
4,0,0,Saying that God told you to do it won't get us anywhere.
5,0,0,Sympathetic jury? Forget it. I don't care if it is your job, murder is murder, and as your attorney, I'll be seeking the death penalty.
4,0,0,I advise you to settle: mistaking "inevitable" for "evitable" in the case of taxes just won't fly.
2,0,0,I'm sorry. There's no open carry defense for a scythe.
3,0,0,Grim, I want to be on the record for advising you that hoodies are not appropriate in the courtroom.
2,2,0,There are pluses and minuses to taking the stand in one’s own defense. In your case I would go with the minuses.
10,0,0,uh, do you like green beans?
2,2,0,You know, the blue cloak makes you seem honest.
3,1,0,I'm sorry I'm not familiar with the Grim Reaper clause.
2,2,0,The jury needs to see your lighter side.
3,1,0,This should be a slam dunk. The prosecution has no eyewitnesses!
3,0,0,I think it's a bit too much for a parking ticket.
7,0,1,So what it's a death penalty case. What do you care?
2,0,0,This may not mean much to you, but your facing life.
3,2,1,The guilty verdict is disappointing, but I'm pleased with the death sentence.
3,0,0,Now surprised witness isn't necessarily a bad thing. Have you wronged anyone in the last couple years?
2,0,0,Well, regardless of your "dominion over all", the IRS is still requiring that you pay "all" of those back taxes.
3,1,0,I think I can get the death penalty off the table!
5,1,0,We're unlikely to get parole, given your record...
2,2,0,I think I can get them to take the death penalty off the table.
4,1,0,If we lose, you may be looking at the life penalty.
9,0,0,But, if I plead guilty, the judge will give me 'a Life sentence.'
3,0,0,I think the death penalties a given.
3,1,0,They have 100,000 years of evidence...Our chances look grim..
3,0,0,I take it you're familiar with the death penalty.
2,0,0,No, I don't think the judge will settle this with a game of chess.
2,0,0,Yes, this is a death penalty jurisdiction.
4,0,1,No problem. The death penalty would be double jeopardy.
2,0,0,Sorry, the death penalty is off the table.
5,0,0,You nailed it.
2,0,0,Let's stop with the footsie, and try to keep this professional.
2,0,0,Yes, I think the death penalty is a possibility.
2,0,0,Our brief: the death penalty is 'cruel and unusual punishment.'
3,1,0,It looks like we have a hung jury.
3,0,0,Can I get an extension?
3,1,0,Sir, this is a tax case--I am certain we can win on appeal.
6,0,0,Donald wants 300 million souls as collateral.
2,4,1,Time to reap what you sow.
5,1,0,There's a good chance you could get life...
2,0,0,Skid marks before the skunk. Yes, yes I've heard that one too.
3,1,0,You can't take a holiday--your trial starts tomorrow.
6,1,0,Did you get your sickle through the metal detector?
3,1,0,I think you should try losing the hoodie.
2,4,1,It's important that you don't laugh when they mention the death penalty.
2,0,0,No, you can't ask the prosecutor what his health plan covers
2,2,0,Sorry. It's not that your too grim, it's the hoody...
4,0,0,The typo was my fault; it should not have read "habeas corpse."
3,2,1,You could be sentenced to life.
2,0,0,Let's just hope for a hung jury.
2,0,0,I'm glad this isn't the court of public opinion.
3,1,0,The bottom line is....you didn't pay your taxes.
2,1,1,I'd prefer a life sentence.
3,0,0,Habeus corpus?
8,1,0,When I said dress up this is not what I meant
7,2,0,I've told them who you are but we live in an extremely litigious society these days.
2,0,0,I need to be honest with you. The outlook is grim.
2,0,0,They don't care that it was just a traffic violation, they want to give you the Death penalty.
3,0,1,I think our best bet is to plead down to justifiable homicide.
2,0,0,Remember, eye contact the jurors (particularly the ladies) and project a light hearted Joie de vivre.
3,0,0,Are you sure you wouldn't rather just pay those parking tickets?
2,0,0,Yes, I told you to wear a dark suit, but don't you have something less grim ?
2,4,1,Would be best to keep your job out of the alibi.
2,0,0,Wait...is this just another lawyer joke?
3,3,1,Where on earth did you get that fantastic hoodie?
2,0,0,I want you to be aware that this might go class action.
2,2,0,How many times do we have to go over this? It's you AND taxes.
2,0,0,Remember, your name is G. Sheldon Reaper
3,0,0,A guilty verdict won't be a problem for you.
2,1,0,They're threatening to take Death off the table
2,0,0,You should be prepared for a life sentence.
3,0,0,Don't worry; obviously, they can't ask for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Ix-nay on the 'D' word.
2,0,0,Can you at least TRY to look a little less grim?
3,0,0,No, you cannot sue Ingmar Bergmann for violation of your right of publicity.
2,0,0,Just to let you know, they're seeking the death penalty.
2,0,0,What do you mean, you're looking forward to the penalty phase?
2,0,0,So far, the "intimidating the witness" strategy seems to be working.
3,0,0,No - it wasn't wise to ask her honour if she feels well.
3,0,0,Your problem is you're a one-trick pony.
2,0,0,If we lose, you could still get time off for good behavior
4,0,0,So you made that yourself?
2,2,0,The good news is they've ruled out the death penalty.
4,0,0,I'm sorry to tell you sir, but I'm going to rush this a little, you see, later on I have an Appointment in Sumarra.
3,0,0,You promised I'd win...
3,0,2,Great news....you are going to be sentenced to death.
2,0,0,You face 55 million counts from last year alone.
4,0,0,No, the death penalty is not an option in this state.
4,2,1,Yes, the witness looks like death warmed over.
2,0,0,....it's not a cold case.
2,0,0,A jury of your peers does't mean they have to be wearing hoodies.
2,0,0,Donald, listen to me, trust me, the Grim Reaper look is a classy step up.
3,3,1,Your employment history is impeccable.
3,0,1,Can we prove the reaping was an accident?
3,0,0,Everybody knows you were supposed to knock first!
2,0,0,Unfortunately, the absence of prints on the scythe actually works against you.
3,1,0,Well, that's not what they mean by the hanging judge...
3,1,1,Just remember they have to prove you were there.
3,0,0,a few further questions, your honor
2,0,0,Are you saying - as your lawyer, I must argue it was inevitable?
2,2,0,That's so hollow...
3,0,0,Try to look at the bright side; You did steal the wheat but I think I can get you off for wrongful death.
2,5,0,If they ask, you've never seen that scythe before in your life.
2,0,0,I hear you, I just think the death penalty is going to be a stretch for jaywalking.
3,0,0,Lose the hoody
4,1,2,Are you sure you want to deliver the alimony in person every month?
3,1,0,The verdict is looking pretty grim.
3,1,0,I'm not so confident the jury will buy our not guilty plea with the whole "death personified" look you've got going on today.
2,0,0,Could you explain how playing cowbell for Blue Oyster Cult is not relevant to this case?
6,0,0,In this instance, the death penalty would be considered "cruel and unusual."
3,1,0,My colleagues get a little suspicious sometimes
3,1,0,Does it really matter if they give you life or death?
5,0,0,Your files came with this really long suitcase.
2,0,0,There's a bad echo in here.
4,0,0,The coat and tie didn't work for you?
3,1,1,"I was just doing my job" is not a good defence.
2,0,0,Okay. Once more: You woke up on January 1st, broke, out of a job and the scythe was just lying there.
7,3,1,Could you try to look less grim?
2,2,0,It's looking kind of grim...
2,0,0,Because you're death, witness protection is out of the question.
3,0,0,Remember to look each juror right in the eye.
3,0,0,You don't have to worry about the death penalty
2,0,0,And please try not to touch the bailiff while you're being sworn in.
4,0,0,Stuff it Ms. Muffitt!! Stuff it Ms. Muffitt!!
2,3,0,Remember what I told you: You're just God's coroner.
3,0,0,It's not the first count that I'm worried about, it's the next 11 billion that concern me.
2,2,0,Don't be so grim; you can only get life without parole.
2,0,0,Without the hoodie you'd have a better chance.
2,0,0,Just answer the question. Don't volunteer any information.
2,2,1,I don't think, "I barely touched him" is going to be a strong enough defense.
7,3,1,I completely agree. There's no way they'll recognize you without the scythe.
4,1,0,At least you look less menacing to the jury without your scythe.
2,2,0,It is, too, a jury of your peers; we're in Texas.
4,1,2,I know you have to be at st. Barnabas Hospital in 15 minutes but this is important.
4,2,3,You've hung all the jury.
3,1,0,If they find you guilty, getting life will be a miracle.
3,0,0,'It was just his time' may not be our best argument.
4,0,0,I can get you a new identity.
2,0,0,No sir, we cannot appeal. The judge ruled that the statute of limitations applies in your case since it was proved you died in 1893.
3,1,0,Remember, the prior Remember the ten billion prior deaths can't be admitted in this case
4,0,0,It's the hoodie and your occupation. A clear case of profiling.
3,0,0,I was hoping for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Conscience, can we talk later?
3,0,0,Wouldl you be interested in hearing about a new term life policy?
3,1,0,You didn't do yourself any favors with that cologne.
2,2,0,The defense rests... FOREVER!
2,0,0,You're my ace in the hole.
2,2,0,Well, they are asking for the death penalty, but the good news is that they don't quite know how that would work in your case.
3,0,0,Shut your hole. If they want to call it a penalty, let them call it a penalty.
3,0,0,And you're certain that you submitted the 1040 on time?
4,0,1,Good news! He's a hanging judge!
2,2,0,Remember what we rehearsed--you were on holiday.
3,0,1,In your case the sentence would be dinner with Donald Trump
2,0,0,The Judge told me you are not to threaten the jury anymore.
2,0,0,No. You can't plead irony to a death sentence.
3,0,0,Don't worry, we can appeal the death sentence on paradoxical grounds. I thought I told you to wear a suit.
2,0,0,Remember, try to avoid eye contact with anyone on the jury.
3,1,0,They can't touch you.
3,1,0,Mr. Death, as expected, they're asking for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Don't worry, I'll just tell them it's your job.
3,1,0,They're going to push for the you sentence.
2,0,0,I need you to stop saying, 'It was his time.' Try 'I don't recall,' instead.
4,2,1,I know, hooded creepy guys matter, I totally get it
3,0,0,How many times do I have to tell you, taxes also!
5,2,0,Don't throw yourself upon the mercy of the court. Remember, you want the death penalty.
3,2,1,Remember. You're just the messenger -- just doing your job.
3,0,0,So, what do I owe you if we win this case?
4,0,1,What was it you said your name was again?
2,0,0,For God's sake Artie, press your human button and smile. For God's sake Artie, press your human button smile.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but it seems that you are still liable despite being dead.
2,2,0,And you're absolutely sure it was his time...right?
2,0,0,It would be time for that killer closing you keep talking about.
3,3,2,It's a parking ticket. You can't ask for the death penalty.
2,0,0,This time, don't touch anyone during the reënactment.
2,0,0,Really, George. You want to push for the death penalty again?
3,0,0,I don't know why they call it a penalty, I'm actually really fun!
3,1,1,I told you the judge would not appreciate you wearing a matching robe.
2,0,0,Well, I'll be damned. You're telling me that you didn't file your taxes?
2,0,0,“Don’t fall for the old ‘Where were you on the night of the murder?’ trick”.
3,0,0,You're accused of ghosting on your wife
3,1,1,I understand your excitement, but this is not Texas.
2,0,0,I repeat...no breath mints, no defense.
3,1,0,In your case, capital punishment may not apply
3,0,0,I told you. Being invisible and in her bedroom is not a defense to the charge of being a peeping tom.
2,0,0,Look at the bright side, how bad could the death penalty be?
2,0,0,Don't give me that blank stare. You can't have a balloon.
2,0,0,So, do we feel good or bad about the death penalty?
4,0,0,They're going to try to present you as a hostile witness.
3,1,0,When I put you on the stand, just don't look at the jurors.
2,0,0,Don't wear that hoodie if you don't want to be stereotyped
3,2,0,Um, yes I did say wear a dark suit.
2,0,0,There is no plea of 'kinda guilty'.
3,1,1,If you're found guilty, you'll get life.
3,1,0,The judge thinks it is a hollow argument
4,1,0,This will go a lot easier if you would stop smiling like you're going to kill someone.
3,0,0,Let me do the talking--I think I can get you life.
12,1,0,Please remember, next time wear a suit and tie.
4,1,0,Don't worry, orange is the new black.
2,0,0,You know, the prosecution makes a pretty good point.
2,0,0,You can't change your plea hoping for a life sentence. The death penalty is still on the table.
2,0,0,Sorry, but I think we're dead.
2,0,0,Just like all the other times, be yourself - quiet and grim - and let me do the talking.
3,0,1,Here's the good news, you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
4,0,2,If you're found guilty, are we still good?
3,0,0,I think the hoodie is overkill!
3,0,0,We are merely going to suggest that the scythe could have been planted at the scene.
3,2,2,If we're lucky, we'll keep you from yourself.
5,0,0,Actually, your not doomed to indictment.
4,1,0,I wouldn't take the plea. It's life without parole.
2,0,0,Don't look so grim Mr. Reaper.
2,2,0,No, no, no - You're GETTING the death penalty
2,0,0,I thought I told you to try and "Blend" for the Line Up.
3,0,0,With a little luck, I can get you life.
5,3,0,If nobody turns up the scythe, you could walk.
3,1,0,If you don't testify, you might get the death penalty.
3,0,0,The court will go lighter on you if you plead guilty to operating an ESCORT SERVICE instead of claiming to be the HARBINGER OF DEATH.
3,1,0,Just take it as face value! I think we can win this case.
3,1,0,Don't look so grim! Reap trials almost always come down to he said, she said.
2,0,0,The bad news is you lost. The good news is you're getting Life.
3,1,0,Get rid of the hoodie. It makes you look guilty.
3,0,0,...and you handle the estate tax questions.
3,0,0,Remember, we're trying NOT to get the guy executed.
4,0,0,Wouldn't it be ironic if you got life?
3,0,0,Sh-h-h. 108 billion counts of homicide is nothing to snicker at.
2,0,0,We're having trouble convincing the judge you have PTSD.
6,5,1,Is there anything between the Black Death and World War II you're not telling me about.
3,0,0,This will only work if you cry when they give you the death penalty.
3,1,0,This should be a breeze - all my other clients are faceless corporations...
2,3,0,No, I don't think they will charge you for every human since the beginning of time.
2,0,0,I think we'll go with the black hole defense.
2,0,0,Yes, they believe you. That's the problem.
2,0,0,It's only some basic legal advice but I would not offer you are here to escort them to hell. Oh, and maybe lose the hoodie.
3,3,1,Remember, state your name as Mr. Reaper, not Grim Reaper.
3,1,0,Naw, trust me on this one - let's leave your sickle in the car.
3,0,0,You should have worn a tie.
2,2,0,You may prejudice the jury
4,0,1,Now's your last chance: Have you ever killed anyone before?
3,1,0,I'll try to get the death penalty off the table.
2,2,0,Don't worry, if you've killed as many people as you say then death row is a cinch.
8,1,0,I'd lose the hood if I were you.
2,0,0,Did someone advise you to refrain facial expression?
6,0,0,So this is how you reward me for getting you out on bail
4,1,2,He's known as the hanging judge. So you're good.
3,0,0,Do you think a softer colored robe would humanize me to the jury?
2,0,0,As long as you assure me this is your first offense . . .
2,2,0,Will you stop asking for the death penalty!
3,1,0,They want to know where your body's buried.
2,0,0,I just found out you got bad news you've been sentenced to Hell!
2,0,0,I would advise that you describe your relationship with the victim as strictly professional.
4,1,0,We'll try to avoid the you penalty....
2,0,0,Any plea deal is unlikely -- in your case, EVERYONE wants to shoot the messenger
3,0,0,Do you really think I need to cop a plea?
2,3,0,If you settle this one everybody's going to sue you.
2,0,0,Hey, good news, you got the death sentence !
4,0,0,Can you hold off until the legal bills are paid?
2,0,0,Sorry, superior orders is not a good defense.
2,0,0,You were just doing your job.
2,0,0,On second thought, I'll represent myself.
2,0,0,Our defense is looking rather grim, Mr. Reaper
2,0,0,Would it have killed you to wear a jacket and tie?
3,0,0,Okay great news: if you plea, the prosecutor has agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
4,1,2,Good news. They're willing to take Death off the table.
2,0,0,Two sugars isn't going to kill me.
3,0,0,I got it reduced to 45 billion counts of second degree murder.
2,1,0,Without the scythe, they're just pointing fingers too.
3,0,0,I have to be honest, this is my first 100 billion tuple murder case.
6,0,0,Both you and your chances in this case are really grim.
3,1,0,I may have to tell you something GRIM.
3,0,0,We're going to try for a life sentence.
7,0,0,The prospect of a favorable judgment looks grim, which wont come as a surprise to you.
3,3,3,Is this your first offense?
10,0,0,Denial, is first.
4,0,0,They are confused about who represents death.
2,2,0,Look whose calling who an "empty suit".....
3,2,0,Bad luck; this judge is pro-life.
3,0,0,You're sure you want to petition the court to change your name to Robin?
2,2,0,I told you not to wear your work clothes.
3,1,0,I think you are a little premature.
3,0,0,Yes, I understand it's 'comfy' however...
2,2,0,Let's see if I can talk them down to accessory after the fact.
2,2,0,Juror #4 is asking that you stop staring at her like that.
3,0,0,Think we should plea bargain for 'life'??
4,0,0,I think you should take the deal.
3,0,0,Just say you killed the slaughterer who slaughtered the ox. They don't care about the kid or the two zuzim.
3,0,0,We could go with a Insanity plea or you could just use the Jedi mind trick and We can be out in Ten minutes !
2,0,0,I still don't think you'd enjoy death row.
3,0,0,We need to concentrate on your case. You can't keep living in the past.
4,1,0,No you can't tell the judge you have met Justice Scalia.
3,2,1,The Judge told me to tell you that he likes your robe better than his.
2,0,0,Forgive the irony, but you should have filed years ago.
2,0,0,Go easy on the deal you made with Trump.
11,1,0,I might be able to get the murder charge reduced to 'Following Too Close'.
4,0,0,No, the jury of your peers thing doesn’t mean they have to dress like you.
3,0,0,Do what I told you and I'm sure we can avoid the you penalty.
4,0,0,So this is the first time I've represented Anonymous.
2,1,0,By the way... I have some bad news.
3,0,0,I thought we agreed on khakis and a nice button down shirt?
3,1,0,You can't convict what you can't see . Worth a try.
3,0,1,I don't think a change of venue will help.
3,1,0,And remember, I've never had a client with a rap like yours.
3,0,1,I don't think we can find a jury of your peers.
3,0,0,Well there's Heaven which provides unlimited texting and there's Hell which prohibits use of all devices. So sir kindly place your phone on the table and follow me.
4,1,0,She may have said it, but where's the evidence that she agreed "until death do us part"?
2,0,0,Any one that says you're guilty has a hole in his head!
2,0,0,Can we take the death penalty off the table?
3,0,0,Well, yes the outfit is a problem.......
6,4,0,As your tax attorney, I have to tell you, the outcome looks pretty certain.
3,1,0,You could've at least put on a tie.
2,0,0,No, even the faceless have to remove their hoods.
5,0,0,Your case is a grave situation.
2,2,0,I really don't think that it is a good idea to put you on the stand.
2,2,0,It's wrongful, Death.
2,2,0,You're scaring the hell out of the jury.
2,2,0,I just got off the phone with the D.A. She said she'll put the death penalty back on the table, if that's what you really want.
3,0,1,With your history of priors, I have to advise you to take the plea.
2,0,0,Let's go shake hands with the prosecutor.
2,0,0,I'm not your homie, know wha' mean?
3,1,0,At least there's no death penalty!
3,0,0,Don't be so grim. We have a good case.
3,1,0,next time leave a witness
3,0,0,This case is beginning to look very grim
2,0,0,I think I can get you the death sentence.
2,0,0,As your attorney, I need to remind you that if you are found guilty, you can get the 'you' penalty.
3,1,0,I'm worried that the prosecution will be asking for the death penalty.
2,0,0,You had me cut my hair, shave, and put on suit, I thought you dress up for my trial!
3,0,0,Here ye reap what ye sow.
2,0,0,Remember on the question of your innocence your response is; "I'm dead right"
2,0,0,You want me to ask the judge for a brief delay in the proceedings because you may have left your kitchen light on?
2,0,0,Yes, your chances are also grim.
3,0,1,Try not to look at the jury.
3,0,0,"I tolled the wrong bell" is NOT a good defense.
3,0,0,I'm assuming that jail time isn't an issue?
4,1,3,The prosecutor says that if you don't accept a life term, he'll be seeking a death sentence... I'm not sure what that means here.
2,0,0,Juries tend to be lenient given short life expectancy, which puts you in a strong position.
2,0,0,You are telling me that that bell tolled for me?
2,0,0,Taxed to death is not a credible defense.
3,0,1,We're going to go with the death sentence.
3,1,0,They're having trouble finding a jury of your peers.
3,0,0,But you only spent one night in Rikeres
3,1,0,I told you to wear the blue suit.
5,0,0,Let's hope for the Death Penalty!
2,0,0,I'll get the IRS off your back if you get off mine
14,0,0,Pleading guilty will avoid you death penalty.
6,0,0,They've got an eye witness.
3,0,0,...but you literally said 'I'm Death, and I am going to kill you now' and it was caught on video." "The dude's name was Herdy. You wouldn't understand.
2,0,0,Try to just be yourself.
4,0,0,...and i was like, dude, we both know that you never even finished the first episode of the larry sanders show, so i don't know why you're pretending to be so mad at me
3,0,0,I don't recommend you take the stand.
2,0,0,No, an appearance is never optional.
2,0,0,Tell me your darkest secret!
2,0,0,Trust me. I'll get you your continuance.
3,0,0,It's gonna be hard to beat this murder rap.
3,1,0,Relax, you had to leave your scythe at the metal detector. Now, you're just a random guy in a hoodie.
3,0,0,No, multiple death sentences does not mean that you just write a paragraph.
4,0,0,Good news. The death penalty is off the table.
2,0,0,No problem; it was just an unfortunate accident that happened when the deceased borrowed your scythe to mow his lawn, as so many had before.
3,2,2,Okay, so we agree; I'm going to go with 'If the scythe doesn't fit, you must acquit.'
2,0,0,I don't advise using "the devil made me do it" as an excuse.
2,0,0,Your case is looking good, because the witnesses are having problems identifying you!
3,0,0,So, if he asks what your occupation is, take the fifth.
2,0,0,When you take the stand, I'm calling you 'Jim'
2,6,3,Remember, she was already dead when you arrived.
2,0,0,I have an interest in your counsel, but is your counsel in my interest?
3,1,1,If the cloak don't fit, they must acquit.
3,0,0,There are some things you'll never have to face.
3,3,2,No, that's not what habeas corpus means.
3,4,0,You need to take the next witness.
5,1,1,It's about who you didn't kill.
2,0,0,Let’s start by asking the judge for community service
5,0,0,Stop asking for the desk penalty, it's just a parking ticket.
4,0,1,Pretend like you're holding an invisible baseball and the gloves won't fit.
3,1,1,No, I don't think your smile is what's making the jury uncomfortable.
3,1,0,I don't think you will be getting a jury of your peers.
5,0,0,Big mouth!
3,0,0,Let's just go for the death penalty.
2,2,0,I tried to get you off, but they're insisting the death penalty.
2,0,0,You've gotta stop staring through the jurors.
3,1,0,It is going to be easier if you confess.
2,0,0,We were able to negotiate additional charges for you, so you will now get death. Congratulations!
3,0,1,Don't look so guilty!
2,2,0,I strongly recommend against taking the stand.
3,0,0,For the millionth time, I WANT life!
2,0,0,I don't really know who you are.
2,2,0,Bad news, they found a scythe with your fingerprints on them.
2,0,0,Now, go explain your innocence-- with feeling.
2,0,0,Ironically, they are seeking the death penalty Mr. Reaper.
2,0,0,If you testify, it will difficult to avoid a death sentence.
2,0,0,H.R.3355
3,0,0,We have to convince the jury that you're not a serial killer.
3,1,0,I think we can avoid the death penalty if you promise not to do it again.
2,2,0,I don't think the cloak is helping you with the jury...
3,3,3,Mint?
3,1,0,Reaper has an eco-feel to it, but the grim as got to go.
2,0,0,This case is gonna be the death of me...
3,0,0,Yes, but in a murder trial you're a penalty not just a fact of life.
3,1,0,Look, it's a no win situation here. She picked you out of a lineup. Plead guilty or go to trial....either way, we're all dead!
4,1,2,As your attorney, I must warn you that the hoodie may give the jury the wrong impression.
2,0,0,You're dealing with the IRS, so you might hold back on the death and taxes jokes.
3,0,0,Bragging about your career isn't helping.
2,0,0,So you say your legal experience is in futures?
3,2,1,What I'm saying is that, as a defense, "it was his time" doesn't give me a lot to work with here.
2,0,0,Remember, no jury tampering.
2,0,0,Will you please stop saying you're OK with the death penalty?
2,2,0,Public defenders can't afford to dress you for court.
2,0,0,Expecto patr- pat- pa. . .[silence].
3,0,0,Sure, I know you'd like a death sentence.
3,0,0,I say we plea bargain for the death sentence.
3,0,0,You're accused of committing a faceless crime.
4,0,1,If any of your past is found admissible, you'll have to take a plea.
6,0,1,I don't want to harp on this, so to speak, but your hoodie is sending the wrong message.
3,1,1,No, we're hoping they're hung, not hanged.
4,0,0,I recommend you plead no-contest to the tax-evasion charge.
3,0,0,I'll do the objecting. Stop with the sulfur.
3,2,1,I wouldn't make any holiday plans.
3,1,0,Fortunately, they weren't able to lift any fingerprints off the scythe.
3,1,0,Of course I believe you
3,1,0,You probably could've gotten away with it if you didn't post those photos on Instagram.
3,1,0,Tell me... are you absolutely certain?
3,3,1,You're not likable enough for us to risk putting you on the stand.
3,0,1,A death penalty is a reach.
2,2,0,There's not a soul in this place willing to testify on your behalf.
3,0,0,Do your best to look innocent.
3,1,0,No, you do not get to 'help with the hangings' if it's a hung jury.
7,0,0,They still haven't found the body.
4,1,3,I am afraid you are looking at life without parole...
3,1,0,Yes, 'Habeas Corpus' is Latin for "you shall have the body," but they don't mean it literally.
2,0,0,I plead non compos mentis.
3,0,0,We're gonna go with the 'sugar-eviscerates-your-soul' defense.
2,0,0,So...What's our deadline?
3,0,0,I advise you to plead guilty but with an explanation.
2,2,0,Stop looking at me like that!
3,0,0,I'll subtly inform the jury that you know where each of them lives.
4,1,0,Look, I know the Death Penalty doesn't frighten you, but I've got a reputation to defend.
2,2,0,But seriously, I love your work.
4,2,3,I know you are used to settling things out of court . . .
3,0,0,O.J. are you in there?
2,3,0,It's looking like afterlife in prison.
2,0,0,No one's going to judge you for wearing a hoodie!
3,1,0,Let me guess, you never settle either.
3,0,0,They found your fingerprints on the queen's bishop.
3,1,0,Well, one thing's for certain, there's no possibility of a death penalty verdict
3,0,0,I mean, I wouldn't say I'm 'religious' but I definitely would call myself 'spiritual'.
2,0,0,community service is what the charge is.
3,0,0,You're looking at infinite death sentences.
11,1,0,If the glove doesn't fit, they must acquit.
4,1,0,As your lawyer, I strongly advise that your case will go better for you if you lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,Just remember, you're the one who was cheated.
4,3,4,Even you can't dodge taxes.
2,0,0,Really? You? Pro-life?
3,0,0,What do you mean, have I ever been an attorney for an eternal client before?
3,2,1,It's a class action on behalf of...it says here...everyone ever.
3,1,1,Her attorney wants your soul too.
3,0,0,At least you didn't bring the scythe to court-- that could help you.
3,1,0,I thought we agreed on sweater vest with button down and tie.
3,0,0,If you are found guilty, may I have your sickle collection?
5,0,1,No, I don't think self-defense will work in this case
5,0,0,Sir, the judge will ask you to remove your hood.
3,0,0,How about we try the “misunderstood” reaper?
3,0,0,So you're in favor of the death penalty?
2,0,0,Just FYI - threatening to eat the souls of the jury usually doesn't go over too well.
3,0,0,The press is going to have a field day if the judge gives you life.
3,1,0,At least the death penalty is off the table.
2,0,0,Welp, so much for habeas corpus.
2,0,0,You've been a huge help through this case - I don't consider you a penalty at all.
2,2,2,What do you mean you're afraid of the death penalty?
3,1,1,I strongly advise you not to use the Twinkie defense.
3,0,0,I don’t think “He lost the game of chess” is much of a defense
3,1,1,Well, at least you're not grim.
3,0,0,I hope you didn't have anything to do with the deaths of all the jurors.
3,1,0,I told you three times, the DA won't agree to the death penalty.
3,0,0,It's judgment day
2,0,0,It's a hollow victory.
3,0,0,I know you want to testify, but I don't think it's a good idea. Did you see the look that juror number 4 gave you?
3,0,1,Your chances for acquittal look grim.
3,2,0,You do realize this may mean life.
3,1,0,Now, when you ask if the death penalty is an option, how exactly do you mean that?
3,1,0,Unfortunately, they abolished the death penalty.
3,1,0,I'm not sure that a plea of "not guilty" is your best bet.
3,0,0,You won't have to plead the 5th or anything else. Leave that to everyone else in the room.
3,1,0,The court won't accept the name "Grim Reaper.
3,0,0,I usually recommend a Mona Lisa smile during questioning, but in your case I think a nice wide grin will work to your advantage.
4,1,2,The good news is you'll never get life.
2,0,0,I hope you have your affairs in order.
8,1,0,Don't look so grim, you always win in the end.
3,0,0,If anyone can get you off the hook, it's Faust & Faust.
5,2,0,You look surprised..
5,0,0,Now don't be grim, we can always appeal.
3,1,0,Then again, maybe we should have stuck with the jumpsuit.
3,0,0,I probably should have worn a tie.
9,2,0,Okay, John Doe, here we go again.
4,1,0,I told you to wear the navy, I can only do so much.
3,1,0,So I think we stay with the hood. Yes, the judge hates it, but juror number 3 keeps smiling at you.
2,0,0,Don't mention the war.
3,2,1,You seem to be making Juror #3 very nervous.
2,0,0,Bad news. They found the scythe.
2,0,0,If they ask you about death panels, take the Fifth.
3,0,0,That's not what a life sentence means.
2,0,0,How about we make "die trying" the backup plan?
3,2,1,There is a hollow ring to what you say.
2,0,0,You should drop the hoodie. It will make you look less grim.
2,2,0,Could you have at least worn a tie?
2,0,0,Are you sure they didn't see you?
3,0,0,Better not. Hoodies have become a presumption of guilt in this courtroom.
3,1,0,I keep telling you . . . the prosecution has six nuns who saw you.
4,1,0,They have the right to face their accuser.
2,0,0,Seriously, a life sentence is preferable to the death penalty.
2,0,0,You're lucky, he's a hanging judge.
2,0,0,"it's my job" is not a defense to a charge of murder.
3,1,0,I'd say your prospects look grim.
3,0,0,When they ask you to state your name, plead the Fifth.
6,0,0,This should be easy. We'll plead guilty and ask for leniency, the death penalty.
2,0,0,Let's face it, you look like a hoodlum.
6,0,0,Whatever you do, don't use the "d" word.
2,0,0,Do you have any dark secrets you'd like to share?
6,0,0,Yes Mr. Reaper, "the dead" can file a class action suit against you.
3,1,0,Death Penalty? Really?
3,0,1,In my view Mr. Reaper, I don't think an entrapment defense will fly.
2,0,0,We're going to go for everlasting life.
2,2,0,Look at it this way -- the worst that'll happen is that you'll get the death penalty.
3,0,0,The reason the trial is being delayed is that something seems to have happened to the prosecutor.
2,0,0,No, the optics are not on our side.
2,0,0,With any luck you will get the death penalty
2,0,0,If you can win this case, I'll owe you everything.
3,2,1,So what was it like working with Ingmar Bergman?
3,1,0,I think we should ask for life.
2,0,0,You might want to smile a bit more -- jurors seem to like that.
2,2,0,Sure they took it. You could seriously hurt somebody with that thing!
3,0,0,Just answer the question honestly. Have you ever owned a sickle?
2,0,0,Didn't I tell you to wear a suit and tie?
3,1,0,I think the scythe is what killed us.
4,3,6,Any priors?
2,1,0,You definitely won't get life.
3,0,0,Our only hope is a hung jury.
2,2,0,How about if we just let him think he's the final judge?
3,0,0,No, really, who are you?
3,1,0,In this case, the death penalty is not a good thing.
2,0,0,Let's bluff 'em, and leave the 'death sentence' on the table.
3,1,0,Trust me, nolo contendere in civil court.
2,0,0,You asked for me?
3,1,0,Nothing is certain in tax cases.
3,0,0,Lawyer: I kept telling you, there are only two things certain in this life. You should have just paid your taxes, this is how they got Blade.
3,1,0,Your case is looking grim, Mr. Reaper
3,1,0,Stop staring at the jury -- there are no more alternates.
2,2,0,I'll try, but I can't promise you the death penalty.
2,0,0,Pro bono, huh? Over my dead body.
3,1,0,So you think self defense is the best way to go here?
3,1,1,Remember your occupation is, "paradigm transition specialist."
4,0,1,Just don't touch me until after the verdict is read.
2,0,0,Sorry, it's a life sentence.
3,0,0,On the plus side, you can't get life.
5,1,0,You're being charged with aiding and abetting.
2,0,0,You were right, the jury would have seen through your headless testimony.
3,2,0,I know its your image - but you have to ditch the hoodie!
3,0,1,Just don't point at the judge.
2,2,0,In order to win we have to change your image!
2,0,0,To avoid the death penalty, I advise you to accept the plea bargain.
3,0,0,Try showing some empathy.
3,0,0,If you owe more than $10,000 in Back Death Taxes, call us today. We're former 'IRS' workers that will work directly with the 'IRS' on your behalf. Don't take on the 'IRS' alone. Give us a call. Operators are standing by.
4,0,0,You do not drink, So what the hell where you doing that night at the pub?
2,0,0,You can't get the death penalty if you're already dead.
3,0,0,I'll be honest with you, things are looking pretty grim.
4,2,0,I'm sorry, but "somebody has to do it" is not a viable defense.
3,0,0,The "Grim Reaper" defense scythes both ways !
3,2,1,My client has a great alibi. That night Irene died, he was at Heather's place. And Gertrud's place. And John's...
5,1,0,Tell them it wasn't a weapon you just wanted to cut down their high grass.
2,0,0,So the verdict is in.
3,0,0,I asked you to wear a nice suit.
2,2,0,What did I say about wearing a hoodie in court?
2,0,0,Your Honor, the Defense asks the court to examine their ultimate fate
3,0,0,We can call most of these self-defense and the rest entrapment.
2,0,0,We need to find you a stronger alibi.
3,0,0,Recidivism? He’s saying you’re a repeat offender, and the court will take that into consideration when sentencing.
2,2,0,"Reaping what you sow" is not a good defense.
2,0,0,La muerte on trial for planning the end of the world.
2,0,0,Should have filed. IRS is going to make an example of you.
3,2,1,Now- once again-yoy're the Ghost of Christmas-What?
3,1,0,Remember, we have to let the jury see the real you.
3,0,0,Under the best case scenario, you’ll get the death penalty.
2,0,0,If you want any sympathy from the jury, ditch the hood.
3,1,0,No...."Death Penalty" isn't an insult.
3,0,0,So you don't think a plea bargain is workable?
4,1,0,Remember, we are going for a temporary insanity verdict.
3,1,0,Okay, so remember to smile at the jury
2,0,0,Would it hurt you to wear a tie?
4,0,1,I assume you're okay with the death penalty.
3,0,0,The selfies are a real problem for us.
4,2,0,Why do I always have to be "taxes"?
2,0,0,Judge did not buy your argument of Soliciting to Murder by your boss
3,1,0,Try to look earnest, but not too earnest.
3,0,1,Ironically, we live in a state that doesn't support your penalty.
3,0,1,I'll argue that when the defendant claimed "Life's a bitch and then you die," she entered into a contract.
3,0,0,Goodbye Winston.
3,1,0,No Mr. Reaper ,with your record a deadlocked jury is highly unlikely .
3,1,0,I suggest we plead diminished reaponsibility.
7,0,0,Don't worry - it's a jury of your pyres.
3,1,1,He's dead to me.
2,2,0,It means that your request to be appointed legal guardian has been denied.
2,0,0,I know you love Halloween, Phil, but really?
3,1,0,Did you have to wear that?
6,1,1,I'll do the talking.
2,2,0,You know, there are a lot of people who want you dead.
3,0,0,It looks as if we have a hung jury.
3,0,0,Your failure to appear isn't helping.
2,0,0,One suggestion: The next time the judge says "Take the witness" - don't.
3,1,0,When the plaintiff takes the stand, try to avoid eye contact.
3,1,0,I will not let you speak in your own defense, Mr Reaper.
3,1,0,I think I can get the judge to agree to a 10-to-life sentence.
4,0,0,There seems to be a little problem with finding a jury of your peers.
3,0,0,...they are seeking life in prison.
3,1,1,I thought that ghostwriter was just an expression
2,0,0,Leave the Death Penalty on the table, then.
2,0,0,We have a chance..they can't find your scythe.
4,1,0,We Made It! DNA, Death Penalty Reversal, Immortality
2,0,0,If we win is it possible to add a few more years to my life?
2,0,0,When I say "the defense rests," don't take that as an invitation.
2,2,0,So let me see if I understand you. You want to plea me down to death?
11,1,1,We'll take the death-and taxes-sure-things stance.
3,1,0,I asked you not to wear your hoodie to court.
4,0,1,To tell you the truth, I don't know how they would handle the death penalty in your case.
2,3,0,Just sweet talk 'em
3,0,0,Why did you bury the scythe in OJ's backyard?
2,0,0,''She claims you were a big facetime fan.''
5,0,4,My advice? Plead the fifth.
3,1,0,What do you mean, you always win?
2,0,0,I'm hopeful.
3,0,0,Relax. The worst that can happen is you'll get sentenced to yourself.
4,1,0,If you took your hood off, you could help your case so much more.
9,0,0,"We need you to get on the stand to show that they do not have a Prima Facie case...
5,0,0,I think you should plead the 5th.
3,1,0,I'm the lawyer. I make the closing statement.
3,0,0,No, I don't think changing your name now will help, Mr.Axe Murderer!
2,0,0,They got you on tax evasion, of that I am certain.
2,0,0,I think we're having trouble with the sympathy vote.
8,1,0,I guess keeping in touch with facetime is out of the question.
8,1,0,Plead insanity.
2,2,0,Have you pissed anyone off?
3,0,0,You've been sentenced to life. Don't ask me.
2,0,0,I don't think I can defend this much longer.
3,1,0,I said it was best to look grim during a homicide defense, not look like the grim reaper.
4,0,0,You should have worn a suit. The jury is unfairly prejudiced against dark defendents wearing hoodies.
2,0,0,The court will agree with your privacy concerns.
2,2,0,We need a better defense than “his time was up.”
3,1,1,My guess is you don't want Life without Parole.
3,1,0,Don't worry. You won't get life.
2,0,0,Okay, I'll handle the civil cases, you do the estates.
3,1,0,Well, yeah, I probably could get a plea deal for manslaughter. But with tens of billions of counts, the sentence would still be quite a kick in the pants.
3,0,0,I'm not saying to dress uncomfortably, I'm just saying hoodies are a bit fraught these days.
3,1,0,The Prosecutor is asking for a life sentence.
9,0,0,I'll probably get a death sentence again.
3,1,0,Did you just call me an 'empty suit'?
2,0,0,OK but when you're on the stand don't be so grim.
9,0,0,Believe me, I am trying hard to conceal the secrets of your " shell corporation....! "
3,1,0,Yes, it does look different from this side of the table Mr. Scalia.
3,1,0,Taxes? Are you certain?
3,0,0,...so...HEY! Are you with me on this one?
4,0,1,You needn't ring your death knell every time I say "I object".
2,0,0,It's going to be up to the jurors to determine if the hood fits.
5,1,0,I cannot advise "I had to see a man about a dog" as your best defense.
5,0,0,Could I get that in writing?
2,0,0,Any prior convictions?
2,0,0,Well, they did say they wanted more page views.
3,1,1,Please try not to laugh every time they mention the death penalty.
4,0,0,Okay, you can keep the hood, but please wear glasses tomorrow. We need the jury to see your softer side.
4,0,0,Trust me. If Luke got away with being too short for a stromtrooper, I can convince the jury that you're a jawa.
9,0,0,Don't let him bait you.
3,1,0,It's not your fault, she was a heavy sleeper.
2,0,0,This judge can't seem to grasp the difference between Rape and Reap.
2,0,0,Show some remorse and apologize to the family members of the jury.
6,1,0,The prosecutor is arguing for the death penalty on this case, although I guess that works in your favor.
4,0,0,No actually, I didn't quite understand your last voicemail message. It didn't make much sense - something about a bell and tolls?!?
3,0,0,I would advise you not to unjustly collect the plaintiff's soul. The judge could hold you in contempt.
3,0,0,They sentenced you to a light year!
2,0,0,Well, the State's not budging on this coaching youth hockey thing.
2,2,0,You might want to remove your head covering.
4,0,0,This could go either way.
3,3,1,At least it's not a life sentence.
2,0,0,Sepulchre? Is that some kind of plea?
3,1,0,I'm death. That's what you want nme to go with?
6,0,0,Nothing is certain, Death, but I think you'll have to pay your taxes.
3,0,1,I wouldn't worry. Their evidence is purely circumstantial.
2,1,0,You don't have a prayer.
3,1,1,Remember, we plead the fifth if they ask about age-related bias in your selection process.
9,0,0,No, I don't think the hoodie was the problem.
4,0,0,You've been sentenced to life in a monastery with no chance of becoming an abbot.
8,1,0,Would a suit and tie have killed you?
2,2,0,Our chances are looking grim.
2,0,0,To be honest things look grim, real grim.
3,1,0,Why strike him? Seriously, "Angel" isn't that uncommon of a name in this community.
3,0,0,No, you're not permitted to take the Fifth when the issue is crimes against nature.
3,0,0,Well, we can't very well go for life without parole.
2,0,0,I was going to ask for some time alone with my client but have changed my mind.
2,2,0,Do not plead guilty.
3,0,0,You brought the wrong folder - these are just a bunch of death certificates.
3,0,0,There is no need to use your alias, I think the jurors will recognize you.
2,2,0,The irony is they want to give you the death penalty.
3,0,1,Yeah but it turns out taxes are more sure.
6,0,1,Let the jury look you straight in the eye.
2,0,0,They're threatening to give life.
2,0,0,Because War, Pestilence and Famine took the dang plea deal, that's why not.
4,2,0,What's the worst you can get? Life?
2,1,0,It's worse than we thought.
2,2,0,You're definately not helping my anxiety.
5,3,0,You couldn't have worn a suit? You just look guilty.
3,0,0,Look, I still think that this is your best bet of getting Cheney.
2,0,0,The jury will see your humanity once they look into your… um…
3,0,0,Don't you worry. This free healthcare bill won't ever leave this room!
3,1,0,So, you are telling me that the death penalty would be a complement?
2,1,1,If you want a jury of your peers, I'll file a motion to have the trial moved to Death Valley.
2,0,0,Worse case scenario; you get the death penalty.
4,0,0,I suggest for your opening statement you take the hood off...
3,1,0,Bad news--you got the death penalty. Good news--that's a conflict of interest.
3,1,0,If all else fails, challenge the Judge to a game of chess.
2,3,0,What do you mean this is my last trial?
3,1,0,I guess we don't have to worry about the death penalty.
3,0,0,What do you think they do once the 20 minute limit is up?
2,0,0,Is there any chance you could do something about Jurors 3 and 11 during the lunch recess?
3,3,2,Remember, you showed him to the gates of Hell, but he walked through by himself.
5,1,0,That is not what I meant when I told you to dress conservatively.
7,2,0,I'm having a hard time putting a face on your case.
3,2,0,Try not to appear excited when they ask for capital punishment.
2,0,0,We’re light on character witnesses.
2,0,0,They found your fingerprints on the scythe next to the body.
3,0,0,The deposed witnesses are reposed?
6,1,0,I know you were hoping for a hung jury, but you will have to face them.
3,1,0,Please, please, please, if he mentions "The Death Sentence," try not to laugh.
2,0,0,Good News... another hung jury...
3,2,0,I still think a suit and tie would work better.
4,1,0,So we're sticking with the "Trick or Treat" alibi?
3,1,0,Don't worry, I'm a tax attorney.
3,0,0,Lose the hoody and smile a little.
5,0,1,Wipe that guilty look off your face.
3,3,2,The worst you can get is life.
3,1,1,Good news--they'll settle for a restraining order.
3,2,1,We can’t lose. What jury is going to risk pissing off Death?
3,0,0,What happened to the emoji I told you to wear?
3,1,0,Don't worry. Reaping is totally legal.
3,1,0,Wait, I'M just an empty suit?
2,0,0,Relax--he's a hanging judge.
3,1,1,We'll just say it was self-defense.
2,0,0,Do me a favor and just point a finger at the jurors a few times during the trial.
4,1,0,Life sounds pretty good, don't you think?
3,0,0,Do I have enough time to put in my football tips?
3,1,0,so tell me about your depression
3,0,0,Hoodie, smoodie--you'll still do 18 long ones.
3,0,0,Can you just keep your hands to your self form once.
3,1,0,We'd be in better shape if you hadn't taken Scalia.
3,1,0,So we'll ask for clemency. They've got you dead to rights on that shell game business.
2,0,0,Sorry, I just got this case. Do you have any character witnesses?
3,0,0,Remember, we're claiming everything from the hardware as a work expense - not just the scythe.
2,0,0,I don't think the judge will buy that your name is Annon E. Muss
2,0,0,I am advising you to lose the hood.
2,0,0,Mr. Reaper the possibility of aquital looks grim.
8,0,0,Take it off before you take the stand unless you want the jury to think you're a thug or a jihadist.
8,0,0,You don't understand: you've run out of your retainer.
3,0,0,Taxes. Yep, you and taxes.
3,0,0,I can't organize a defense if you keep bugging me about playing chess.
3,1,0,Bad news. The prosecutor isn't seeking the death penalty for you.
6,0,0,He's about to get jail for life...trust me on this one, death
3,0,0,Please try not to approach the witness.
10,2,0,I'm afraid that your case looks rather grim.
5,3,2,For the last time, this is traffic court. I cannot request the death penalty.
3,1,0,Remember: Don't look the jury in the eye.
4,0,0,Why yes, my last name is Baggins.
3,0,0,Acquittal shouldn't be a problem...after all, this is a 'no death penalty' state.
3,0,0,Tommorrow - less eyeshadow.
2,0,0,Well yes, the Second Circuit is certainly an advocate for karma, but it unfortunately does not tolerate the use of a scythe on a trader outside Delmonico's.
3,0,1,This case is the least of my problems?
2,0,0,So you can just part us, like, legally, right?
2,0,0,Why are you telling me this?
2,2,0,Why didn't you tell me about the scythe?
3,1,0,You know, it's not like pleading guilty is going to kill you
3,0,0,H. G. Wells would be proud.
4,0,0,Stay away from any radical comments on the death penalty if they don't confirm you.
3,1,0,Would you be mad if you heard I don't believe in the death penalty?
2,0,0,Racketeering? Are you kidding me?
5,2,0,I think it's best you don't testify.
2,2,0,Trust me. It's called the metaphor defense.
2,0,0,There's no prima facie case.
2,0,0,I don't care if it's your job-you have to show some remorse.
2,0,0,Well, then maybe we should skip the character witnesses
3,2,0,I told you to stop pointing at Juror #5.
2,1,0,Remember what I told you - NO giggling if you get the death penalty
2,0,0,The prosecution is killing me?
3,1,0,I don't think the jury is going to buy the 'Dead men tell no tales' defense.
3,0,0,Can you hear me now?
3,1,0,Cross your fingers, I think I can get you the death penalty.
4,1,0,Please stop requesting a hung jury.
3,0,0,At least the death penalty is off the table." At least the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,we'll call your scythe as the next witness
3,1,0,We lucked out. The judge is dead.
3,0,0,You're not the type to hold a grudge are you?
6,0,0,Are you the hollow man?
2,0,0,What they're gonna argue is that a death sentence saves lives.
3,1,0,Fortunately, the state just repealed the eternal life penalty.
4,1,2,Let me do the talking, and remember, you have never been to Panama.
3,1,0,I think Habeas Corpus is the best way to go here...
2,3,0,Our only chance is to play the grace card.
4,1,0,The judge has just told me that when sentencing you he needs to take into account the other one hundred billion cases of murder
3,1,0,I told you to dress for court!
3,1,0,The best you can hope for is 20 years to death.
2,0,0,The good news is that, technically, you can't get the death penalty.
2,0,0,Pro bono? With your record, it means you're screwed.
3,1,0,This is a big thrill for me. I usually handle taxes.
2,2,0,We'll argue mistaken identity.
2,0,0,How's life?, Is life good for you?
2,0,0,I fully understand that you favor the death penalty if convicted.
3,0,1,Our best hope is to do in the judge
3,0,0,So how long have you been a public defender?
4,3,1,You'll be lucky to get life.
2,0,0,Twelve across, five letters. Opposite of life.
2,1,0,Relax, Ichabod, I'll get you off.
3,1,0,Unfortunately, it's death AND taxes.
3,0,1,I don't think 'just doing my job' is a sound defense in this case.
3,0,0,I blame Frank Luntz. The judge is ruling that the Estate Tax name change means you owe a bundle in back taxes.
6,1,0,On the bright side, the jury can't give you the death penalty again
6,1,0,The problem is that not everyone appreciates your sense of humor.
4,1,3,I have to be honest, the outlook is grim.
3,0,0,Litigious society, agreed. But there Is significant exposure here. Scrooge's Defamation of Character claim will be a challenge.
5,0,0,...don't even think about it
2,0,0,Law school did not prepare me for this.
3,1,0,What happened to the ghost of Christmas past? He was Scrooge's key witness!
4,0,0,Is the plea bargain still on the table?
3,0,0,Twenty to life -- take it.
3,0,0,This above all: to thine own self be true.
3,0,0,Lose the hoodie, it might give them the wrong idea
2,0,0,As co-counsel, you should wear a tie.
2,3,0,That witness is looking a little sick. Need I say more?
2,0,0,Maybe you should wear something else to court.
2,0,0,If this verdict doesn't turn out well, mind if I take over?
2,0,0,We may have trouble finding a jury of your peers.
3,0,0,Yes, they've 'produced the bodies.'
2,0,0,Stop telling the jurors you can't wait to meet them.
3,1,1,The outlook is grim.
3,1,0,- I took the scythe cause it might adversely affect the jury! - But they can't convict me when it's my job!
3,2,1,Well yes, if six or more of the jurors suddenly died at the same time a mistrial would be declared, but what are the odds of that happening?
3,1,0,We're trying to get the scythe found at the scene ruled inadmissible.
3,0,0,Work with me here, your attitude is killing me.
4,0,0,Good news, the Prosecution is not seeking the death penalty!
3,2,0,As your lawyer, I'm advising you not to say anything about your support for the death penalty.
4,1,0,What do you mean; "what's my date of birth"?
3,1,0,Tell them you were just following orders.
3,0,1,Well maybe you should have thought of that before you decided to shake hands with my witnesses.
2,0,0,They've given you two minutes for high-sticking.
2,2,0,I'll ask for an adjournment to save face
3,0,0,What did I tell you about white juries and hoodies?!!?
2,2,0,I'll get it reduced to life.
3,1,0,I don't think I can get you off. But we can avoid the death penalty.
2,0,0,It would help your case if you stopped slowly pointing at each member of the jury.
2,0,0,You're not going to get a better deal than life.
2,0,0,I think you should quit your day job.
2,0,0,No worries, we will pin it on your campaign manager
3,0,0,No, I don't think the witness is looking a little old.
2,0,0,We should probably talk about the death penalty.
3,1,0,They're willing to take the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,Hold your breath
2,0,0,Well what do you think about if the scythe don't fit you must acquit?
2,0,0,If you'd listen to my advice about death and taxes you wouldn't be here.
2,2,0,Let's skip the race card and play the death card instead.
3,0,0,Now don't go losing your head over this - juries notice every little thing.
4,1,0,Would you like a breath mint
2,0,0,Seriously? You couldn't have worn something a little less obvious?
4,0,0,Good news - the IRS lawyers agreed to a jury instruction on irony.
5,0,0,I'm going to put you on the stand tomorrow Ralph.However, I wan;t you to go home and do something about your hands.
2,0,0,Did you even bother to look in the mirror this morning?
3,0,0,We've managed to avoid death row.
3,2,1,Population control is not a defense.
2,2,0,Is life-without-parole really an option for you?
2,0,0,"It's what you do" may not be the best defense.
4,1,0,Well, so much for Deflategate, coach-- but next time, ditch the hoodie
2,2,0,The judge is insisting that to dismiss "prima facie" you actually have to have a face.
4,0,0,Relax. You've overcome even the worst-case scenario.
4,0,0,You're the typical wrongful death attorney.
2,0,0,Freezing the breathalyzer and having no blood is going to tough to explain.
3,0,0,They're going for the death sentence. Try not to look happy.
4,0,3,My suggesting to "Dress to Kill" was a metaphor.
3,1,0,And don't bring up 'death panels' again.
2,0,0,We hate your message, but your right as messenger is protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution!
3,0,0,I gather this could end in the death sentence.
2,0,0,Try to look sympathetic.
2,0,0,Just remember: deny, deny deny.
3,0,1,Knock off the "Your time is at hand". A simple "yes or no your honor" is enough.
3,0,0,This isn't what I meant when I said to dress like you were attending a funeral.
6,0,0,Can you face the judge? I'm getting echo.
2,0,0,You're kidding, right?
2,0,0,Remember, you were just the messenger.
2,0,0,Don't be proud.
3,0,0,You've heard "You reap what you sow"?
3,0,0,It guaranteed the removal of all lines, scars and sun damage.
2,0,0,We could have a problem with the "corpus" part of the writ.
3,0,0,It's OK. It's OK. Not a setback. I felt like we had to try Jurisdiction. Now we'll go for habeas corpus, that's where we'll get you off.
3,0,0,Well, it is a scythe, so technically ax evasion isn't a completely erroneous charge.
2,0,0,Hey Death, I'm Taxes.
2,0,0,I told you to wear a tie - you look a little intimidating.
2,0,0,I'm glad to see you decided to take my advice and face the charges like the man you seem to be.
3,1,1,No laughing when they give you life.
3,0,0,Remember, "if the scythe doesn't fit, you must acquit."
2,2,0,I think you're looking at life.
2,2,0,Are you crazy, of course we want the death sentence!
3,1,1,We really need to change your image.
2,0,0,the seventh seal defense may not be our best option here
4,0,0,I've got good news, they're seeking the death penalty.
3,1,0,It doesn't really matter, right?
3,0,0,Well, since there's only one of you, a jury of your peers turned out to be 12 tax lawyers.
2,0,0,"He had it coming" just won't do....
2,0,0,Your best shot is to roll with the Michael Jordan meme.
2,0,0,I don't think we're going to make it to trial.
6,0,0,No, you don't need to appear before the Court.
3,0,0,I don't care that it wasn't flattering, you still should have worn the navy blue suit.
3,0,0,Don't worry, we're up right after Martin Shkreli.
3,1,0,Nobody's ever tried to plea-bargain for the death penalty!
3,2,0,Yes, I'm sure 'absence of malice' will not be effective here!
3,0,1,Sorry, I forgot to tell you h-o-o-d-i-e is spelled g-u-i-l-t-y in here.
3,0,1,What's the worst that could happen?
2,0,0,We'll plead not guilty by reason of invisibility.
3,0,0,It'll be important to establish that you've paid your taxes.
2,2,0,Try to tone it down. I don't think yelling 'I'll see you in hell' at the prosecutor is going to help your case.
3,2,0,I doubt you'll get life
2,0,0,Say nothing about your black hole theory
9,0,1,So, you're telling me that the death penalty isn't even on the table?
2,0,0,Not sure I like our chances, you literally hung the jury.
2,0,0,Are you on board with our seeking the death penalty?
5,1,1,I AM the death penalty
3,1,0,try to look on the bright side
5,4,14,Who'd have thought they'd get you for tax evasion.
4,2,0,Are you sure you don't want to plead and get life?
3,0,0,You told her, "Ich komme nicht zu strafen."
3,1,1,If the judge gives you the death penalty, try not to laugh, OK?
2,0,0,You want to put the death penalty "on" the table?
4,0,0,In your case, I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with the hoodie.
5,1,0,You look like a 'New Yorker Cartoon'
4,0,0,She never said anything about a prenup.
2,0,0,Just show a little remorse, we can probably get you a reduced sentence.
2,0,0,I know a way out of this, but I'm not sure you're going to like it.
3,3,3,The prosecution wants life.
3,0,1,And you stole the scythe?
2,2,0,Honestly, I wouldn't worry so much about the speeding tickets.
6,0,0,This case will be so famous, they're going to name the penalty after you.
2,2,0,Mr. Reaper, the judge is going to send you away for a long time unless you send him away for a long time...if you get my drift.
4,2,1,I just really think you should have gone with a coat and tie.
3,0,1,They're demanding the you penalty.
3,0,0,What are the odds? I specialize in estate taxes.
3,0,0,Try not to have a blank stare when you look at the judge.
2,0,0,You're starting to make me feel like my case doesn't have a chance
3,5,0,I told you not to show up in your work clothes.
2,0,0,I still think the non--existence plea is your best shot.
2,0,0,I thought you were just absent-minded
2,2,0,Are you SURE the Devil made you do it?
4,0,0,Yes, Mr. Scrooge is suing for defamation. All you have to do is nod and point.
2,0,0,I am not putting you on the stand!
4,0,0,Your defense needs brightening.
3,0,0,You shouldn't get life.
3,0,0,Well, it's the hollow cave face that seems to bother him most. Else, it's the bailiff in about 20 seconds.
3,0,0,I can't let you take the stand. If the jury sees that you are faceless, they may jump to conclusions."
2,0,0,They aren't buying our discounted future earnings.
2,0,0,We've met before at that dreadful mixer at Skidmore in '04.
3,0,0,The judge is threatening to impose the life penalty.
4,1,2,Ditching the scythe was a good first step. Now about the hoodie...
2,0,0,You're going to need to come up with a better alibi for "where were you on the night that everyone in all of recorded history died?"
3,0,0,They're rejecting our plea for natural life.
5,0,0,Oh crap. I wasn't supposed to look you in where your face should be.
6,0,0,The case is looking grim.
2,0,0,I take it this isn't your first offense.
2,2,0,For God's sake, what did you expect? The penalty is actually named after you!
3,1,1,I have bad news. The death penalty's off the table.
2,0,0,Are you certain that you're certain?
3,0,0,We are going with "unlawful search and scyther."
3,0,1,You're in luck--he's a hanging judge.
5,0,0,It's not that Grim...
2,0,0,If the hoodie doesn't fit, you must acquit.
3,0,1,They want you to try on the hat.
3,0,0,Next time wear the tie I gave you.
2,0,0,No, I said I need a deft defense.
2,0,0,I wouldn't worry about the penalty phase.
4,2,0,I think I can get you a life sentence.
3,0,0,Look cheerful.
4,2,3,We can get a court order but I can't guarantee that the magazines will stop.
4,0,0,Yes I know, but also unavoidable are your taxes.
3,0,0,I'm not sure, but I don't think the judge likes dire prophecies.
3,1,0,Keep in mind: O.J. was acquitted.
4,1,0,No, the death penalty does not apply to parking violations
2,0,0,Would you consider wearing a tie?
2,0,0,Your scythe is being held as evidence.
3,1,1,No fingerprints on the scythe - we're good.
3,1,0,You of all people should have known that taxes are inevitable!
2,2,0,Bad news. Taxes is turning state's evidence.
3,1,0,Remember, he was already dead when you got there.
5,1,1,My strategy is to just buy us a little more time.
2,0,0,It may be advantageous if you remove the hoodie and stop the moaning sounds, your frightening everyone in the courtroom.
8,0,0,OK. I'll explain to the judge that you smell so bad that you just like to kept covered. I'm sure he'll understand.
2,0,0,What do you mean you may have "mixed a few up?"
3,0,0,You may very well have faced He Who Judges All Mankind, but in the courtroom of the 63rd District magistrate, I'm the one who knows how to play the game.
2,1,0,If he asks if you have no sense of decency, plead the Fifth.
4,0,0,Let's try and promote your good side.
2,0,0,How can I help you?
2,0,0,Okay, okay. We'll seek the death penalty.
6,2,1,Clients don't usually ask me to argue for "Death".
3,1,0,Don't take this the wrong way, but I saw this coming.
2,0,0,Don't worry, they can't give you life.
3,0,0,You're sure the hoodie doesn't fit?
2,2,0,I'll leave the closing arguments to you.
4,1,0,You didn't tell me there were multiple counts.
3,1,0,Don't worry, there's no death penalty.
2,0,0,Yes, shaving would have helped.
2,0,0,This is Traffic Court, it is NOT a death penalty case!
3,1,0,You couldn't have worn a suit?
4,0,0,No. You don't get the sickle back. It is evidence now.
2,0,0,I'm a lawyer, not a magician
2,0,0,This judge has no soul
2,2,0,You probably shouldn't have worn the hoodie today.
2,0,0,Counsel. Explain to me please how "Life plus 25 " works again.
2,0,0,Fortunately the state's outlawed eternal life.
2,0,0,Yes, Texas has no right to infringe on your business.
3,0,0,not a good time to announce you support the death penalty
3,0,0,We will bury them.
2,0,0,How did the defendant survive? I thought you were flawless.
3,0,0,It looks like the jury wants to give you life.
2,0,0,...they found you guilty, beyond a shadow of a doubt
5,0,1,It's in the bag - this state doesn't have a death penalty.
3,1,0,First off, I'll only refer to you as 'Mr. Grim.'
3,1,1,Trust me. You're dead. This double indemnity defense is gonna work.
2,0,0,The judge is going to ask you to face the jury, and that's when I'll declare a mistrial for discriminatory practices.
2,4,1,She also wants your scythe.
2,2,0,Character witnesses may be an issue.
3,0,0,What do you mean you'll give them the death penalty?
2,3,0,Remember, you can't face the jury.
2,0,0,Good news. It's the death penalty.
2,0,0,Is this a me penalty state?
3,0,0,Remember to smile when you take the witness stand.
2,0,0,I thought we agreed on a sweater vest and tie?
2,0,0,Are you sure you knocked before barging through the door?
2,0,1,Your closing argument had a hollow ring to it.
3,1,0,I advise you to plea, "Let me be me."
3,0,0,Was a suit and tie too much to ask?
3,2,1,Describe your occupation as "end of retirement advisor"
2,0,0,The prosecution is requesting self-imposed punishment.
3,1,0,"Maybe you shouldn't wear that on the witness stand." '
3,1,0,Fidel who?
2,2,0,As your attorney I must caution you. You could get life.
2,0,0,Sorry, Death, but you're getting life.
2,0,0,The charge is life insurance fraud.
2,0,0,It may be a little grim, but we are taking this one to the grave.
6,0,0,So, have you heard that new Drake song yet?
3,1,0,Let me be clear about this...even if I lose this case, I still retain possession of my soul
3,2,2,I'm sorry. They've sentenced you to life.
3,0,0,I'd prefer a hung jury.
7,1,0,You tried to sneak your scythe past security again, didn't you?
2,6,1,I'm not going to lie - things look pretty grim.
2,2,0,I think it was a mistake to call Famine, Pestilence, and War as your character witnesses...
6,0,0,You sure this is the only way to avoid jail time?
5,1,0,You're sure you want to plead not guilty"?
2,0,0,How's that whole grim reaper thing working for you now?
3,1,0,They can't find the bodies you buried, but they've got you on tax evasion.
2,0,0,You shouldn't worry. The worst you can get is death.
3,1,0,Yes, it would appear that there is a third certainty when you wear a hoodie on the streets of America
2,2,0,Remember, our position is "Scythes kill people."
3,1,0,I got you a backstage pass to the Justin Bieber concert.
2,2,0,If there's no obit, they must acquit?
3,0,0,Sorry, this is traffic court....
2,2,0,I think it would be in your best interest to avoid using your nickname.
2,0,0,You can testify but you have to lose the scythe and the hoodie.
3,1,0,Since this is your first trial for the firm, I will tell you when to go for the kill.
2,0,0,Remember, you're just a guy trying to save the world from overpopulation.
2,0,0,On a positive note they took the death penalty off the table.
6,1,0,Scythe, smythe. We'll never get that thing into evidence.
2,0,0,No, you shouldn't take the stand.
2,2,0,I can't tell the judge that your name is also your job!
3,0,0,I know it's a killer of a case but the hijab is just overkill.
2,0,0,They didn't find any finger prints. So, the evidence is circumstantial at best.
4,1,0,We'll just tell the jury you're from the hood. It doesn't sound as grim.
3,1,0,I'm sorry the verdict didn't allow you to save face.
1,0,0,I don't think you can take the fifth.
3,0,0,Lucky for you we may get you off with involuntary manslaughter.
3,1,1,With any luck the prosecutor will ask for life.
2,0,0,This is about more than just saving face.
9,0,0,I know you want to testify, but as your lawyer I advise against it.
2,2,0,This case is going to be the death of me.
7,0,0,You can't be serious!..
3,0,0,This is a life or death situation.
6,0,0,You're taking this 'See no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil' thing a little too far.
2,2,0,Ditch the hoodie, just take the 5th.
4,0,0,And you're absolutely positive it was Bill Cosby?
6,0,0,Do you rather I begin with Milton or Pratchett?
2,0,0,I think I can get you the death penalty.
3,1,0,Don't worry if we lose. They keep calling it a penalty but it'll feel more like a slap on the wrist.
3,0,1,We can probably assume that the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,0,"GUESS WHO?" IS NOT A NAME!
4,2,0,Now, remember to keep your poker-face when you sit up there.
3,0,0,Might be a little late for a plea bargain.
2,0,0,No,. They're saying it's the other way around.
2,0,0,Trust me. This fifth has nothing to do with the circle.
3,0,0,FYI. My death eventuates an immediate IRS audit of your tax filings.
3,0,0,Which circle are we in?
3,1,1,Trust me, without the scythe, they've got no case.
3,0,0,I don't think killing all the jury members is a good idea.
3,1,0,How many billable hours do I have left?
2,0,0,Moving this trial to the financial district is the only way we'll find a jury of your peers.
2,0,0,We need the jury to see you as a cheerful Reaper.
3,0,0,You told me to keep a low profile.
3,0,0,They've offered a plea of Manslaughter.
3,1,1,I don't think they'll seek the death penalty. Too ironic.
3,0,0,When I said dress for court, I just assumed you understood that meant lose the hoodie.
2,2,0,I need you to look alive when you take the stand.
3,1,0,I say we ask for the death sentence, with time off for good behavior.
3,1,1,You're my father?
3,1,0,Don't worry. The numbers are on your side.
2,0,0,They're willing to drop the homicide charge if you plead guilty to misdemeanor theft of a scythe
6,0,0,So much? And I thought my last lawyer's retainer was high.
2,1,0,The hoodie was not a good idea.
3,1,0,That's fine, but then you'll need to do the taxes phase of the trial.
4,2,4,No, I'm afraid we can't plead inevitability.
3,0,1,No smiling when the eye witness takes the stand.
2,0,0,"Hipster grass cutting?" Really?
3,0,0,So you save face, and maybe find yourself ahead in the end. Win-win.
2,0,0,So, you actually want me to ask for the death penalty...
3,0,0,Remember, never mention that scythe.
2,4,1,How about, 'If the hoodie doesn’t fit, you must acquit!'?
3,1,0,"It will go better if you don't say "over your dead body" to the judge again.
2,0,0,As long as you didn't leave any fingerprints, you'd be fine.
9,2,1,You sure you want to stick with the Holy Ghost defense?
2,0,0,I wouldn't worry about the sentencing phase. You're already a dead man.
5,0,0,This case will be the death of me.
3,1,0,Leave the objections to me, ok?
3,0,0,I don't think you should testify
3,0,0,Sure it’s unfair, but juries in this town are biased against the angel of death.
2,0,0,We'll fight to keep the life penalty off the table.
3,0,0,Just hang in there. A slap on the wrist, collect your scythe from the evidence drawer, and you'll be on your way
3,2,2,Your chances look pretty grim.
3,0,0,I expected you to look more relieved at a verdict of "involuntary manslaughter."
5,1,0,Don't worry, they couldn't pick you out of the lineup!
2,2,0,Yes, they're going to eye roll if you say, 'I'll see you in Hell.'
3,0,0,Tell 'em you've been advised that it's your duty to not answer any frikkin' questions.
5,1,0,That's not what they mean by "hung jury."
3,1,0,You're sure you're not guilty?
3,1,0,How do you feel about capital punishment?
4,0,0,well this is my report on the argument of TTIP in which the US intends to enslave the entire world to corporate US businesses which will eventually lead to the WW3 and the end of the human race and your folder is the argument for it
3,0,0,It's tax season, make them remember that.
3,0,0,Let me do the talking and don't make eye contact with the judge--he'll see right through you.
3,0,0,Perhaps 'The devil made me do it.' is not your best defense.
4,1,0,Just one juror not on your list, and we are home free.
2,0,0,THE JUDGE WILL GIVE YOU PROBATION IF HE CAN HAVE YOUR HOODIE.
2,0,0,Don't worry. I can get you off this murder charge. They have nothing on you.
3,0,0,I think we should discuss the possibility that your next stop is the twilight zone.
4,1,0,Tax evasion, huh?
2,0,0,I told you to wear a suit and tie during the trial
3,1,0,Let's stay real here - And that means no more 'ghost-of-a-chance' opinions.
3,1,0,This really seems like Double Jeopardy.
3,0,0,I believe that your courtroom attire is not helping our case.
2,0,0,I told you winning a chess game is not admissible evidence.
3,1,0,Bad news, they gave you Life.
6,0,0,Looks like you're going to get Death Row!
3,0,0,Let me get this straight - you would like me to _ask_ for the death penalty?
3,0,0,That death penalty joke was too arrogant and did not help our case
2,0,0,For the jury, focus more on the 'angel' than the 'death' part.
4,1,0,I think it will be abundantly clear to the jury that growing up in the 'hood had a big impact on your identity formation.
2,0,0,You should have gone with the plea bargain.
2,0,0,Not that it matters to you, but I have gotten the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,Relax. The evidence will prove he can't get out of your contract by knocking over the chess board.
3,1,0,I WANT A DIFFERENT LAWYER.
3,0,0,Take off your hood or they'll think you're black.
4,1,1,The prosecution claims they can connect you to any murder.
3,0,1,What happened to my straw man?
3,2,2,The jury's returning. Try not to look so grim.
2,0,0,Stick with "Death doesn't kill people - people kill people," and you'll be fine.
2,0,0,Believe me, mistaken identity is our only defense.
3,0,0,What do you mean you feel this is a case of profiling?
2,0,0,Why are you hiding?
3,1,0,Well, at least we know the prosecution wont't seek the death penalty...
2,2,0,My bad! I thought you would have loved the death penalty.
3,2,0,If only we didn't have jurors 3 and 7 ... just sayin'.
2,2,0,You've got to stop saying 'All Deaths Matter.'
2,0,0,No. I don't the court will let us call Beelzebub, the ruler of demons, as a witness.
2,0,0,Did you have to wear a hoodie?
3,0,0,On the positive side, I don't think you'll have to worry about receiving the death penalty.
3,0,0,Put yourself on the stand and it will come back to haunt you.
4,0,0,It is very nice to meet you too.
2,0,0,Gimme ten minutes.
3,0,0,It doesn't matter, they still consider it a penalty.
3,1,0,As an expert witness try smiling less.
6,1,0,We could cut a deal if you tell me where Taxes is hiding out.
9,2,0,I think I can get the murder charges dropped down to aiding and abetting.
3,1,0,Bad news - they're offering life.
2,0,0,Would you prefer I go for the death penalty?
3,1,0,It's the state that asks for the death penalty, not the defense.
3,1,0,Why are you always so grim about everything??
2,0,0,It's the IRS, so you really should consider their settlement offer.
3,0,1,The jury will never accept a plea of 'You could be next.'
3,1,0,Lets face it, no pun intended, things look grim Mr. Reaper.
2,0,0,Be yourself with the Jury, or else they'll see right through you.
3,0,0,You wait until now to tell me you did do it!
2,0,0,Too bad, but since you're already dead, they can't give you life.
3,1,0,Anything you say may be used against you in the afterlife.
2,0,0,The healthcare tax is coming down hard on diners.
3,0,0,If you take the deal, I can get you life.
2,0,0,Tell the judge you promise not to hang out in the old hood.
1,0,0,They took the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,I could have lent you a tie.
2,0,0,If the jury comes back with the life penalty, we'll appeal it.
2,2,0,no. I said death and taxes. Not death and illegal offshore tax shelters.
2,0,0,So it's true. You do reap what you sow.
2,2,0,I must advise you that it looks grim.
3,1,1,This is traffic court, there's no pleading guilty and asking for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Don't worry. I'm requesting an anonymous jury. They will relate to you.
3,0,1,A death sentence is the least of our worries
2,3,2,They are digging up a jury of your peers.
2,0,0,You tell all your clients to plead "no contest," don't you?
3,0,0,Unfortunately, the writ your referring to isn't actually pronounced "habeas corpses."
2,0,0,I think the prosecutor is gonna offer a plea bargain for life.
2,0,0,No, Blue Oyster Cult performing "Don't Fear the Reaper" wouldn't qualify as character witness testimony.
2,0,0,No one seems to know why or by whom Judgment Day was capitalized in the statute.
3,3,2,So, what happened to your last attorney?
5,0,1,The bad news is the judge supports the You Penalty.
3,0,0,Don't threaten to smite the jury, it makes you appear less sympathetic
2,3,0,It's the worst possible verdict. They gave you life.
8,1,0,Unless they can somehow tie the scythe to you, there's a good chance of acquittal.
2,4,1,I'm pretty sure I can get you life.
3,1,0,Is it possible to lose the hoodie? The jurors can't relate to you.
2,0,0,Appeals on behalf of morbidity have been ruled out.
9,0,0,They'll give you back your scythe if you promise you won't take anyone away with you.
2,0,0,On the
2,0,0,Taking this deal will help eradicate life in prison.
3,1,0,I'm not saying it's you, but the whole jury died on sentencing day.
3,1,0,He said up the river, not across the river.
2,0,0,They'll knock it down to 100 billion counts of voluntary manslaughter.
3,0,0,What do you care? It's only 25 years.
4,1,0,Remember, without fingerprints, they can't prove anything.
2,0,0,I told you not to try the robe on. The fact that it fits hurts our case.
5,1,0,Piece of cake. My firm represented Ted Kennedy.
2,2,0,I really think the jury is starting to see you less as the "Grim Reaper", and more as just "Death".
3,1,1,It's good news...you got life.
2,2,0,The next time you're questioned, try to avoid the maniacal laughter
3,0,0,Unfortunately, there's legal doctrine that prohibits inheritance by a person who murders someone from whom he or she stands to inherit.
4,0,0,You could be facing a death penalty.
5,0,0,No, there is no pleading the Sith...
4,0,0,I told you, the jury hates hoodies!
3,0,0,We've got an Evangelical jury. Try to play more "Angel" than "of Death".
2,0,0,I am pretty sure the prosector's facial recognition software is not that good.
2,0,0,We're hoping to keep the scythe out of evidence.
2,0,0,...the bad news is, you're looking at life without parole.
2,0,0,Maybe we should stop insisting on a jury of your peers.
2,0,0,Don't worry about saving face when you testify.
4,0,0,Good news! I got your second life term cut in half!
3,1,0,It's about the hoodie.
2,2,0,Look. There's no way I'm putting you on the stand. I think your best bet is to stare at juror #3.
4,0,0,I will not let you take the stand wearing that "hoody" it will send the wrong message to the jury.
3,0,0,Whatever you say, remember to keep it con-scythe.
2,0,0,The Judge is not buying the "wheat farmer" story.
2,0,0,Stop asking to shake the prosecutor's hand.
3,2,0,Stop looking so grim and we can win this.
3,0,0,The best I could do is life in prison.
6,0,0,Let's make this easy--don't show your face.
2,0,0,Our alibi is taxes.
3,1,0,We'll just tell them you have a great track record filing habeus corpus.
2,0,0,I'd say the jury's seriously considering the death penalty, but not for the usual reasons.
3,0,0,Don't look on the dark side. Juries like diversity.
4,1,0,Telling Juror #8 that his time is near did not help your case.
2,0,0,Your homeowners won't cover my fees.
5,0,4,If they give you the death penalty, try not to do your happy dance.
4,0,0,"Don't worry---your not gonna get 'life' on this.
5,2,0,I'm going to try to get him to waive the death penalty but you'll have to plead guilty to aggravated assault with a sickle.
3,1,0,I'm not sure "he was at peace with it" is our best defense.
2,2,0,I think we can get you off with life.
2,2,0,Do you not own another suit?
2,0,0,Again - NO - we are not asking for the death penalty!
3,0,0,I think I can get you off if we can prove she binged at Chipotle.
3,1,0,All things considered, 30 years isn't so bad.
2,0,0,It's looking grim, Grim.
3,0,0,Remember to take the fifth when they ask your name.
4,0,1,I don't think we should put you on the stand
2,0,0,Now you just need the jury's approval. Then you'll only have twenty-five years to wait!
2,2,0,You didn't tell me you were sleeping with her.
3,1,0,I know it's ironic, but they're giving you life.
6,1,0,It's not looking good, Mr. Cheney.
5,3,0,Death penalty? You’ll have to be more specific.
3,1,0,What do you mean, you were framed ?
3,0,1,I tried..but when you're dead you're dead !
2,0,0,You're sure you want me to go ahead with that "chess defense" ?
3,0,0,With luck, you'll get life.
3,3,0,I'm sure you'll appreciate the irony of 'life in prison.'
5,0,1,I recommend you plead the scythe.
11,1,0,Mr. Reaper, didn't we agree on a new hood when the charge is murder?
6,0,0,Look death I know you came here to defend your killing off of the middle class, but we already have the Koch Brothers doing that.
2,0,0,Dying declaration?
3,0,0,It was suicide! I had nothing to do with it!
3,0,1,When you take the stand, don't say, "He had it coming."
4,2,0,Remember, don't let them bait you on your involvement with the tobacco industry.
3,0,0,OK, but this in the last time ...............who's there?
3,1,0,That's what you're wearing? Work with me here.
6,1,1,If you'll plead out the scythe charge, I can make the rest of it go away.
2,0,0,You are charged with first degree grimness.
2,2,0,How do you know the jury is hung?
3,2,1,I don't think 'It's my job' is a good defense.
3,2,1,Just say you're looking for the real killers.
2,2,0,What's the worst they can give me?
2,0,0,I'd say looks rather grim right now Mr. Reaper.
3,1,0,Are you still there?
3,1,0,Your scythe may only be symbolic, but it is admissible.
3,1,0,It's just that the hood has sort of a connotation.
3,1,0,It doesn't look good but at least there's no death penalty in this state.
3,1,0,Change of venue? To where?
3,1,0,Ok. Now, remember. The key is to make sure you don't get life.
3,1,0,Yes, I know what happens if we lose.
2,0,0,Worst case? They sentence you to you.
2,0,0,My daughter would be scared.
3,0,0,We can plea bargain for a life sentence.
3,3,1,Yes, I believe that would be considered jury tampering.
3,0,1,No, I don't know why they call it a penalty.
4,0,0,I hope you have a lot of cash stuffed up that robe.
2,0,0,Honestly, your outfit is a little much. I suppose I should just be glad you didn't wear your #NoLivesMatter t-shirt to court.
3,1,1,"Be more specific, how many trillions"?
3,0,0,I understand these Police Body-Camera's are bad for business but maybe we should cut down a tad?
3,1,0,Well, we're not in Silicon Valley. Here you look like the Unabomber.
3,1,0,By the way, I wouldn't mention anything about that large scythe of yours...
2,0,0,I think there's a good chance you'll get life.
2,0,0,Yes, it's good, but 'Love and Death' is not my favorite Woody Allen movie.
3,2,2,Don't worry, it only feels like eternity.
3,1,0,I think I can get it down to manslaughter.
3,0,0,I'm afraid I have bad news. They have notified the judge they will be seeking the life sentence.
2,0,0,How empty do you think I feel?
2,2,0,Don't tell the judge you knew his mother.
3,1,0,Something tells me you know which way the jury is leaning.
3,1,0,Thanks for your vote of confidence.
3,2,1,I'm not sure that this is the time and place to be rockin' a hoodie.
2,2,0,Can you show the jury a little remorse?
2,0,0,You can't avoid taxes.
3,2,2,Just to recap: you did it, you'll keep doing it and that's that?
3,0,1,And whatever you do, do not stare at the jury.
3,0,0,I appreciate you see the case as res judicata; even so I'd like to earn my fee.
9,1,0,Y'know, the victim was killed with a scythe.
2,2,0,Let's get Juror No. 2 "removed"
3,0,0,So if you get the death penalty, what are you worried about?
2,0,0,Don't worry. What's the worst they can do? Sentence you to death?
5,0,0,'I think the judge giving you the death penalty is a little on the redundant side."
2,0,0,I'll be frank, your odds are grim.
3,0,1,Your prospects are looking grim.
2,0,0,I said "coat and tie," not "cloak and scythe."
2,0,0,By the way, for my fee...I'd like my soul back.
3,1,0,Ok, I got them to take the You Penalty off the table.
2,0,0,I'm afraid they want to give you Life.
5,1,0,No chance in hell you'll win on wrongful death.
2,2,0,Keep a straight face.
2,2,0,If they ask about Scalia, plead the Fifth.
2,1,0,But, all your peers are dead.
2,0,0,They're going to try to establish intent.
3,0,0,I hear you, but i can't see what your saying !
3,0,0,You see, when a comedian dies on stage, it's just a saying.
3,0,0,Because without the plea bargain you'll get life.
3,1,0,There's no getting around this. You're going to have to put your hand on the Bible.
3,1,1,First of all, in the court of law, "habeas corpus" does not mean "take the body."
2,0,0,I think I can get you life!
3,1,0,I'm telling you, you have to face the facts.
12,0,0,The defense: "Till Death Do Us Part" won't get you far.
3,1,0,What do you mean you don't believe in the death penalty?
3,0,0,Don't let them rattle you; they call me an empty suit too.
3,0,1,Next time try to remember: Death AND taxes
3,1,0,At least you won't need to worry about the death penalty.
3,1,0,Dave, I think this is the right moment to tell you that I've been having an affair with your wife. But I'm going to have to fire you again.
2,0,0,Worst case scenario, you could get life
2,2,0,Well good thing for you you didn't kill all the lawyers
14,0,0,If we're going to win this case, you need to lose the hoodie and keep a low profile.
3,0,0,If you want to sue to model for "The Scream," you'll have to lose the hood
5,0,0,Are you sure you want me to defend these Mossack Fonseca allegations with the "Death and Taxes" argument?
2,0,0,...then i said, the IRS does not believe in karma, Mr. Smith
3,1,0,It's going to be hard to get a fair jury in Miami
2,0,0,The only way I can get the jury to overlook the fact that you've killed everyone in the history of the world is if you get rid of the hoodie.
3,0,1,Reap what you sow
3,1,1,Next year you should just pay your taxes
4,0,0,As your lawyer I have to know: did you mean to kill them?
3,0,0,Listen, we all know the Oppenheimer quote. Next time just say, "Not guilty, your honor."
2,2,0,Please don't do your victory dance if they find you guilty.
3,3,1,Don't forget to smile.
3,1,0,We've only a ghost of a chance.
3,1,0,It's not looking good. Throw a kiss to Juror #6.
2,0,0,Sir, IRS offers you a payment plan.
3,1,0,"Cross my heart and hope to die" isn't going to cut it.
6,0,0,I don't think there's a bulk discount.
2,0,0,The scythe was frightening the jury.
3,0,0,What do you mean You are The "Devils' Advocate"?
2,0,0,The death penalty should be a cinch.
3,2,0,You'll have to dump the hoodie if you want to impress this judge.
2,0,0,Any chance you can remove the hoodie?
2,0,0,You should have worn the nice blue suit I got for you and ditched the hoodie.
2,0,0,"They've taken the death penalty off the table".
4,1,3,The prosecutor's asking for life.
2,0,0,How does a life sentence sound?
3,0,0,I don't think they'll be seeking the death penalty again.
3,1,0,Your case isn't as grim as it looks.
4,0,0,Are you sure they didn't get a good look at your face?
2,0,0,Don't worry, we're going to appeal the life sentence. I'm gonna get you to death row.
7,1,0,I told you, I don't have ANY character witnesses.
2,0,0,If you want to be acquitted, I suggest you ditch the pride routine.
2,2,0,Death penalty? You'll be fine.
2,0,0,It will help your defense if we refer to you as something other than the Grim Reaper.
3,0,0,The plea is guilty or not guilty not I just lost my head.
4,0,0,They'll offer the death penalty; we'll claim double idemnity.
3,0,0,I think I can get them to drop the charge down to Man slaughter.
4,0,0,As my attorney, you said you could make this all go away.
2,0,0,When you argue for the death penalty, try to sound impartial.
3,1,0,When you ID the perpetrator it'd be best not to point.
3,0,0,My people do not communicat well with your people.
3,1,0,When you take the stand, tell them how the whole thing left you mortified.
8,0,0,I should have said more like what -I- would wear to work.
3,0,0,No, Kafkaesque trial isn't a good enough reason to plead fifth.
2,0,0,I _believe_ it's an Eddie Bauer cloak, but -
4,0,0,Sentencing could be rough - you've got a lot of previous...
3,1,0,So how do you feel about the color orange?
3,0,0,Just watch what you say, you have that guilty look.
3,1,0,Yes, there is a chance that it'll be a hung jury.
4,2,0,Just give her the house and car before she starts bringing up the other stuff.
3,1,0,If you plead guilty, they'll drop the death sentence.
2,0,0,I'm not sure that taking the stand will help get the jury's sympathy.
2,0,0,Not quite what I meant when I suggested you wear business attire.
4,0,0,Just stick with that you can't put a face with a name.
4,0,0,We got this. There's no defense against death.
3,0,1,I think you should plead the fifth dimension.
3,0,0,Who exactly has been ripping off and profiting from your graffiti designs?
2,2,0,You realize seeking the death penalty for jaywalking is irregular.
3,0,1,Just this once take my advice and take down your profile picture and tone down your posts on Facebook.
11,2,0,Win or lose, we're still going to the party.
3,1,1,Any last words?
8,0,0,I'm not sure the occupational hazard exception applies in your case.
4,0,0,i know your past shouldn't prejudice the jury, but don't count on it.
3,0,0,I don't think the affluenza will work here
2,0,0,Remember, Mr Reaper, if anyone asks God is NOT dead.
2,2,0,Remember, you've never owned a scythe.
3,0,0,No, I still don't like the providing-a-public-service defense. Just keep killing the judges, okay?
3,0,0,The best the jury will give you is parole without life.
2,2,0,We'll plead down to mankindslaughter.
2,0,0,Why can't you tell them who's on first?
4,1,0,Try to look friendly.
2,2,0,You gotta lose the hoodie
5,0,0,WE COULD PLEA BARGAIN FOR LIFE
10,0,0,Your breath smells like death.
3,0,0,OJ Simpson?
3,6,4,We're going with the "it was their time" defense.
3,0,0,Stop chuckling every time they mention death.
1,0,0,Yes, I know that none of the witnesses could identify your face in the line-up but the scythe is pretty incriminating.
4,1,0,So is this your first time as the plaintiff?
3,1,0,She'll return your scythe in exchange for her The Walking Dead DVDs.
3,0,0,So I take it that you knew about the death penalty?
2,2,0,No expression is not a suitable substitute for a first impression
2,0,0,No, I don't think asking for life in prison will get you off the hook.
3,0,0,You're exhibit A of the murder case.
3,1,0,Yes, so these claims go all the way back to the beginning of time; it turns out there is no statute of limitations for what you did.
3,1,0,You cannot ask for the death penalty for your traffic citation.
3,1,0,I know you feel cheated, but demanding the death penalty in this case is, frankly, absurd.
3,0,0,As your attorney, pleading the Grim Reaper defense will not work in Salem.
3,0,0,Plead mythology.
2,2,0,I've never seen anything like it -- seven billion restraining orders.
5,0,0,Wrong, I am the voice of reason.
6,1,0,They'll settle for another 10 years.
2,2,2,What is it that you don't understand about habeas corpus?
3,0,1,I think it's better if you don't testify.
2,2,0,How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
3,1,0,Wait. You want me to ask FOR the death sentence?
2,0,0,Yes I think we both agree the Death penalty is discriminatory in your case.
2,0,0,Can we discuss who people hate more after the trial is over?
8,0,1,Remember, you've never seen that scythe in your life.
4,0,0,This time, let's scare them
2,2,0,Unfortunately, the “inevitability of death” is not a valid legal defense to murder.
3,1,0,Well..do I even have time to finish this brief?
4,1,0,No pun intended, but our chances look grim.
3,0,0,Honestly things are looking grim. They have a killer case against you.
2,0,0,Believe me, I'm trying to get you the death penalty.
3,1,0,I'm certain taxes will be here.
3,1,0,If it's any consolation, I believe you're innocent.
3,1,0,Reaper, you can have your scythe back after court.
2,0,0,Tell them you're not only representing yourself, you're your own sentence as well.
3,1,1,Existentially speaking...... I don't think we can lose.
2,0,0,Isn't there a family member here today who could run home and get you a necktie?
4,1,1,Look, stop grinning at the jury. It's not working.
2,1,0,Remember, I'll do all the talking.
2,0,0,If we don't plea you could get the death penalty.
2,0,0,Your case isn't looking good but I don't think you have much to lose.
3,1,0,Yes, I understand that a life sentence is not your first choice.
3,0,0,If the pumpkin does not fit, they must acquit!
3,1,0,I don't care what you have on your business cards, for this trial you will be known as Billy Reaper.
2,0,0,Ever wonder why some people are in the wrong place at the wrong time?
3,1,0,It's just like we practiced: "Not that I recall."
2,0,0,They want you to serve five to ten, but I think we can get them to agree to the death penalty.
2,0,0,Alright, so I'm doing this pro bono, but don't forget our deal. When I die, I get to go out banging some hot chick, like the president did in "Dave."
5,0,0,Everyone knows you're a sure thing, but these tax people have something going for them too.
2,0,0,It says here, 'Turn to Seventh Seal.' What's a Seventh Seal?
2,2,0,Unfortunately, this is a class action lawsuit.
3,0,1,Okay, I understand that but I worked hard to get your conviction thrown out.
3,1,0,you'd have to admit, these cases are becoming more grim
3,0,0,So I went to Donald Trump's rally but I'm not the KKK. I'm with the shleppers at Seville's Holy Week parade
3,1,1,You should plead Inevitability.
3,1,1,I'm afraid just arguing 'his number was up' isn't going to get you acquitted
2,0,0,Any chance I can get the chair by Friday? I have a date Saturday afternoon...
3,0,0,Don't mention the scythe.
2,0,0,I'm certain that you will get a reduced sentence!
2,0,0,Hi, Harry Potter esq. I'm either going to defend you, or pull out my wand and yell "Expecto Patronum"
10,0,0,As the attorney defending you against a mass murder charge, I have to ask you, "Who picked your outfit?"
2,0,0,Hey! Lighten up, it's just a cartoon.
3,1,1,We're getting some push back on work release.
2,0,0,What do you mean you won't 'accept' a life sentence?
4,0,0,''I specifically said 'suit,' not 'professionally.' ''
3,0,0,Hoodies always prejudice the jury.
3,0,0,To be honest, our chances of winning this case are looking pretty grim.
3,1,0,So - are you okay with the death penalty?
2,0,0,Hey, what are some good chillwave bands bro?
3,1,0,Don't worry. They can't get a positive ID on your face.
2,0,0,Why don't you take this witness?
4,0,0,Noo, I'm Emile Dickinson.
3,1,0,Plead not guilty then we'll implicate Father Time.
3,1,0,I'm glad you ditched the scythe, but would it have hurt you to put on a tie?
3,0,1,You'd be surprised how few interns choose tax law.
3,0,0,Don't you think it might be better to throw yourself on the mercy of the court?
3,0,0,Due to the grizzly discovery of the hung jury, we motion for mistrial.
3,0,1,No, you cannot plead "taking a holiday."
3,0,1,They said they found your DNA on the scythe.
3,0,0,I think it's to play the wraith card.
3,0,0,No DNA, no fingerprints, no positive ID – we’ll beat this easy.
3,0,0,For God's sake Terrence, all you did was shoplift!
3,1,0,Death Lives Matter!
3,0,0,They're ruling out foreplay owing to your three counts of resisting a breast.
2,2,0,I'm so tired of these wrongful death lawsuits.
3,1,0,You're killing me.
3,0,0,You just got the death penalty but, I'm curious, who's going to take you to the other side?
2,0,0,Why didn't you tell me they had an eye witness?
2,0,0,Needs more cowbell.
3,0,1,The death penalty is not an option in Traffic Court.
8,2,0,Sorry, I think they are going to give you life!
2,2,0,In your case, the death penalty might be preferable to jail time.
4,0,0,Our defense is, yes he steal souls; but... come on guys, he's the Grim Reaper.
3,0,0,Of course I trust in your innocence, but I beg you to look the other way!
3,0,0,The prosecution is going for the death penalty.
3,0,0,I'll try and argue for concurrent sentences.
3,1,0,No, the teeth are fine. Juries like toothy. But let's just get you some wax lips, eh?
2,0,0,You'll like this; they gave you the death penalty.
2,2,0,"What do you mean you don't think juror number 11 will make it to the end of the trial"?
6,0,0,I like your brief.
3,1,0,Mr. Death, as your counsel I STRONGLY urge you to plead the fifth.
2,0,0,Let me do the talking!
3,1,0,So the plea is, you go free and everyone lives, right?
2,4,1,I remind you again. This is not a death penalty state.
3,1,0,We're going to try to plead it down to being the anthropomorphic personification of involuntary manslaughter.
3,1,0,Care for a breath mint?
2,0,0,We need a hung jury.
2,0,0,You can run......but......you can't hide!
3,0,0,With all due respects ,Community service at the funeral home is your only option.
4,0,0,I thought I told you no hoodie.
2,2,0,Just out of curiosity, what's going to happen when you place your hand on the Bible?
4,1,0,You are not in witness protection yet.
7,1,0,When you take the stand, try not to look so grim.
3,1,0,You have nothing to worry about. They'll never be able to identify you.
3,1,0,I think that hood may prove detrimental.
2,3,0,I'm thinking this is my last case.
3,1,1,Do you have any character witnesses?
3,0,0,We're pushing for death with parole, but it doesn't look promising.
4,4,0,It doesn't matter that his name was on your list.
3,0,0,What the face !!!!!!!!????
3,0,0,Just don't get any penalties.
2,0,0,May I suggest more contemporary attire once the jury has been seated..?
4,1,3,We can always say you had a tough childhood
4,1,2,Remember: if the scythe doesn't fit...
4,0,0,Frankly, I don't think you have a chance in hell of winning this claim of breach of contract for selling one's soul.
2,0,0,As your attorney I strongly advise you not to plead self-defense.
2,0,0,Are you willing to be cross examined?
4,1,0,You should have picked out a different colored hoodie.
3,0,0,Granted, for you it wouldn't be a real penalty, but they still want to have their trial.
2,0,0,you know that death and hoodies just dont mix.
3,1,0,We have a witness who can identify you from an old photo.
2,0,0,Since you're already dead, they'll give you life.
4,0,0,What? You really need to borrow my glasses?
2,0,0,Remember: you had an appointment in Samarra.
4,0,0,We'll get more from them this time, I promise.
5,1,1,Can you get me out of this?
2,0,0,I didn't realize that parking in a Fire Lane was now a capital crime.
3,0,0,You can't wear the same clothes you were seen wearing in the CCTV.
3,0,0,you have a death wish!!!
3,2,1,My fee is negotiable.
5,0,0,Can you repeat that? This time, without the echo............
2,0,0,Fine, you can take me. But may I first moon the jury?
3,1,0,People accepted you until you took Michael Jackson
2,0,0,Okay--she's offering joint custody of the other three housemen, but she wants the beach house in return.
5,1,0,Try to lose the smirk, will you?
2,0,0,I find it interesting that you call me an "empty suit."
2,2,0,You appear to be a habitual offender.
2,0,0,Don't take this personally, but the outlook is grim.
6,3,2,Tell them you can't take the whole day off.
7,1,0,"Et in arcadia ego" is not a great alibi.
3,0,0,I think I can convince the jury that the Grim Reaper owns the rights to the hoodie.
2,2,0,I think you're beyond double jeopardy.
4,0,1,So, ummm, how do you feel about the death penalty? I would advise you to refrain from calling the death penalty, simply another day at the office.
2,0,0,Breach of contract?! I was the one who was cheated!
3,0,0,If you wanted Clarence Darrow, you should have thoght of that earlier.
2,2,0,We maybe able to use this in your defense. Tell the truth. Did you want to be the Unabomber or Dopey?
3,0,0,Calling yourself Dr. Death is not helping.
3,0,0,You bet the Devil, on who' s a better lawyer?
3,0,0,You ever heard the expression, "dead right"? I didn't think so, take the offer.
7,0,1,I'm glad I've got you as my lawyer.
3,0,0,Hell is whenever I'm with you.
2,0,0,They confiscated your scythe because you keep raggin' on all that "harvester of souls" nonsense.
2,0,0,They'd settle for eighty years, with no dementia.
4,0,0,What made you think "I'm gonna kill you" was an appropriate response to "How do you plea"?
3,0,0,If you don't take the plea, you could be looking at a life sentence.
2,0,0,Your prints were all over the scythe.
3,1,0,I know the death penalty thing appeals to you but this is only a minor traffic violation
3,4,1,I take it you would be okay with the death penalty.
3,0,0,If they can't produce a sickle, I think we're good.
3,0,0,I am afraid the prognosis is grim.
2,0,0,How can house arrest be a 'horrible' outcome?
3,0,0,As for that 'inevitable' crap, the IRS wants to own it.
3,1,0,The judge and jury may not look too kindly at your professional success.
5,0,0,The jury is death-qualified.
5,1,0,Maybe a suit and tie tomorrow.
3,1,0,The thing is ... courts in this State are pro-second Amendment and 'open carry', but a sickle, that's a whole different issue.
2,0,0,It's going to be tough to beat 42 billion counts of murder.
2,0,0,So ... worst-case scenario. What are we looking at here?
2,0,0,How does the death penalty sound to you?
4,0,0,On the bright side, there's no death penalty.
5,0,1,You really need to stop giggling every time the prosecutor mentions the death penalty.
3,1,0,These wrongful death cases can be tricky
3,3,2,Bad news, you could get life.
4,0,0,"Now??, like right now?".
2,0,0,Loose the hoodie. It makes you look too Silicon Valley.
2,2,0,You don't give me any confidence in your legal expertise.
3,0,0,I offered to hire a stylist for the trial, remember?
5,0,1,On the plus side, capital punishment in this state is "beheading".
3,1,1,Have you thought about pleading guilty?
3,0,0,What part of "Lose the hoodie" did you not understand?
3,1,0,Listen, Eminem, the Unibomber's intellectual property suit is not just going away; I really think we should offer a settlement.
4,1,0,The only way you will get the jury to like you is if you take out Shkreli.
2,0,0,I think putting you on the witness stand could be a big mistake.
3,0,0,I'm telling you, a jury won't like the hoodie.
3,0,0,...on the other hand, none of the survivors can positively identify you.
3,0,0,Luckily, in this state there is no penalty for death.
3,2,0,Just say you are self employed.
2,0,0,You got life without parole.
4,1,2,Yes, I think having one of them drop dead would be considered "jury tampering."
2,2,0,Are you here for me or my case?
5,0,0,They can't implement the death penalty unless you commit suicide.
5,0,0,Silent Yes , Invisible No
2,0,0,So much for a deconstructed martini!
3,1,0,As your attorney, I don't recommend requesting death.
2,0,0,When you testify, try not to be so grim.
3,1,0,If you cop to the first billion counts, I might be able to get your sentence reduced.
3,1,0,Don't kill me, but I can't seem to find your birth certificate.
3,0,0,I promise you, if you just say what I tell you, you won't lose face
2,2,0,This is not my doorstep.
2,0,0,Looks like they've got you dead to rights.
4,1,0,You should have gone with the grey suit and blue tie.
5,0,0,Of course you are innocent, but I'd plead the 5th anyway.
3,0,0,We're looking at death
2,0,0,Don't worry, they're going to give you life.
5,1,0,Please don't take him until he pays my bill.
5,1,0,remember to put your best face on for the jury.
1,2,0,Do you have a blue suit?
3,0,0,I am just not sure that it is a good idea for you to take the stand in your own defense
3,2,1,Let's hope justice is blind.
4,0,0,Let's just hope the jury sees you as a kindly Dementor for helping the prisoners at Azbakan escape.
3,2,2,..and then if you get Death, how does that work?
2,2,0,If you take the stand, they may only see a hood.
4,1,3,I advise we don't go for the "You Penalty"
2,0,0,Must it always be the death penalty?
3,1,0,Your death sentence is being appealed.
2,2,0,You can kill me, but I can audit you.
4,0,1,Sorry to waste your time but we decided to go for Life without parole.
4,0,1,"sure, but I don't think self defense is on the table".
3,0,0,With a repeat offender's record like yours, we should... What's that? You want to take the fifth?
2,0,0,No, two LIFE sentences!
2,0,0,I don't think you have an alibi for the murder.
3,1,1,I'm afraid things are looking a bit grim, Grim.
4,1,3,Honestly, your only chance of getting off these charges is winning an election to public office
2,0,0,If you would remove that hoodie, you may be judged more leniently.
3,0,0,Habeas what?
2,0,0,Divorce Court
2,0,0,I thought we'd agreed you'd wear the blue suit.
2,0,0,Will the jury be confused when they learn I'm the defendant?
2,0,0,Nobody innocent wears a hoodie
2,0,0,We can plea bargain down to manslaughter.
2,0,0,Would it kill you to smile at the jury once in a while?
3,1,1,"We've got this - no one's ever cheated you yet.
5,0,0,It's a class action - Everybody in the World against You. No worries.
3,0,1,Your hoodie makes you look guilty.
3,1,1,You've got to show them you're not just an empty robe.
2,0,0,No. I don't think we can argue you deserve a tax exemption.
3,0,0,Just plead the 5th. It works for everyone else.
6,1,0,I wouldn't be making any veiled threats.
3,0,0,I wouldn't worry about the death penalty because, well, you know.
2,0,0,Your case is looking grim
2,0,0,I don't think your testimony will help my client avoid the death penalty!
2,0,0,"Death penalty"...get it?
2,0,0,Yes Mr. Reaper, this is a class action suit brought against you by the Imps of Death, for excessive withholding taxes and gross underpayment since the beginning of time.
3,0,0,You said what?
2,0,0,Listen Grim, I'm the king of Trademark law and I say you invented the hoodie.
2,0,0,Are you here to tell me I'm on death row?
3,1,0,Take. The. Stand.
3,0,1,If all else fails, we'll ask for a writ of Habeus corpse.
2,0,0,Are you sure juror eight was at your funeral?
5,0,0,But, sorry, a zip code is required.
5,0,0,I don't think it's wise to tell each juror when you intend to visit them.
5,0,0,Your chances of winning this case are grim.
9,1,0,"You should maintain eye contact with the jurors so they believe your innocence".
2,0,0,I predict a hung jury.
3,1,0,The good news is it's not a capital offense.
4,1,1,Now remember, our defense is that you were just following orders.
2,2,0,"Could you at least have worn a tie"!
3,1,0,There is no higher court.
3,0,0,It won't be life or the death sentence, so I'm not entirely sure what we're doing here.
3,1,0,Lucky for us they got no fingerprints off the scythe.
3,0,0,Sorry, but in my legal opinion,'The butler did it' is not a viable defense.
3,1,0,Don't answer any questions about taxes. Death you can talk about.
2,0,0,Now is not the time to write poems.
3,0,0,No, GR, a life sentence is NOT a good thing.
2,2,0,You're innocent until proven inevitable.
2,2,0,This case is driving me to an early grave. Please stop smiling.
2,0,0," Listen Grimm, the Law clearly states that you sew what you Reap "!
2,0,0,A life sentence? Are you sure?
2,0,0,But he said he would replace the Constitution with 'something terrific.'
3,1,0,It's completely circumstantial; it could have been anyone's scythe.
3,1,0,Don't worry. I think they will have a hard time finding a jury of your peers.
3,1,1,Try to look less grim.
2,0,0,Hoodie vs. suit and tie? The debate continues.
4,0,0,Don't you think we're laying it on a little thick?
3,0,0,Of course your fingerprints weren't found, but the dead body isn't going to help you either.
2,4,1,'Just doing my job' is no defense.
3,0,0,I thought we had a chance until you told the jury, 'I'll get you all someday.'
2,0,0,Don't interrupt me, I'm killing it.
4,1,2,He sentenced you to life, just for the irony.
2,0,0,Yes, the acquittal is nice, but it's the civil trial where they'll kill you.
3,1,0,The death sentence is off the table.
3,0,0,The death penalty, we can be certain, is off the table.
6,0,0,No. It's an illegal U-turn and a first offense. We shouldn't ask for more than a fine.
3,1,0,Nothing extrajudicial this time, ok?
2,0,0,Your briefs read better than the Joy Of Love !
3,0,0,The judge has denied your claim of retroactive death benefits from the beginning of time.
3,0,1,The D.A. is offering leniency if you testify against your Boss.
3,0,0,What are you going to do when I tell you "Face the jury" ?
4,0,0,All I'm saying is it could help your case to lose the hoodie and remember to put your face on before showing up every morning.
2,0,0,I should point out that in your case, a plea bargain will not help you escape the death penalty.
2,4,1,You can't plead "It's my job" to the murder charge.
2,0,0,I know you're the executioner - I'm worried about the judge and jury.
3,1,1,Try not to look so grim, Mr. Reaper.
3,1,0,I don't think "If the hood don't fit we must acquit" defense will work here.
4,0,0,I don't think the judge will accept 'just kidding' as a plea.
4,0,2,Where did you say you were from?
3,0,0,Apparently, those were the droids they were looking for.
2,1,0,No, Mr. Reaper, 'till death us do part' is not considered plea bargaining.
2,0,0,We can appeal.
5,0,0,Sorry, but no, sir, they don't validate parking.
2,0,0,We need to change your image. You look like death warmed over.
4,0,0,In your case, I'd say dress for the sentence you want and not the job you have.
3,1,0,Look, I know how to pronounce it, but I'm still going to call you Dr. Deeth.
3,0,0,You're giving me mixed signals - how do you plead?
2,0,0,The judge wants you to list all the institutions that issued these certificates.
2,0,0,So you think we should ask for the death sentence?
2,0,0,And I wouldn't bring up the 'habeus corpus' angle.
3,1,0,I'll claim you're being framed because of the hoodie.
2,0,0,I don't think the jury is buying the argument that you are a tax-exempt nonprofit.
2,0,0,Stop pointing at the jurors. We're running out of alternates.
9,0,0,Listen up! You are the flip side of an OB/GYN." "Listen up! You are the flip side of an OB/GYN.
3,1,1,As he looked into the face of Death; Hanratty had second thoughts about bringing up the subject of "Billable Hours" to his client.
3,1,0,I'm afraid they're seeking the death penalty.
2,2,0,Seriously, don't worry about this. Trump sues everybody.
2,0,0,If this thing goes south, we can always play the wraith card.
3,1,1,What? I just got this dry cleaned.
2,0,0,The charge is inappropriate garb for a 40 year old.
2,0,0,Let's face You are a born loser.
4,0,0,You'd better start preparing to get a life !
3,0,0,I say we go for the death penalty.
4,0,0,We'd have a better chance if your last name wasn't Penalty.
4,0,0,Would you consider community service in Corrections, just 'til we get this lethal injection thing sorted out?
3,0,1,They say your DNA is on the sickle.
3,1,0,The stages here are similar to what you're used to seeing. Deny everything, argue, plea bargain, but ultimately accept the verdict.
3,0,0,Just wait for the appeals process. It's a killer.
3,2,0,I'm sorry, there is no death penalty in this state.
3,1,0,We're good-this judge is pro-death penalty.
8,0,0,I know you’re upset, but they won't issue you the death penalty for failing to pay last year's income taxes!
2,0,0,If you let her live, she'll let you keep the beach house.
2,0,0,This is a bankruptcy case. My client isn't a great guy, but his ex-wife can't demand the death penalty.
4,0,0,Don't be alarmed, you could get life.
3,0,0,You have to take a plea. Your case is facially defective.
2,0,0,...and if the jury finds you guilty, try not to strike down the foreman.
3,0,0,No, I don't think we can subpoena members of Blue Oyster Cult to take the stand in your defense.
2,2,0,So, the guy was already dead when you got there?
3,1,0,I should have mentioned my fees earlier--$500 an hour, and eternal life. And I get the scythe if we win.
4,1,0,Let's put it this way: The scythe of justice cuts slowly, but it cuts really deep ...
3,1,0,Don't worry, all they have on you is loitering.
5,0,0,Your choice; the electric chair or the scythe.
2,0,0,If you take the stand, they'll see right through you.
2,0,0,I know there is no way of stopping you, but thank you for at least participating in our judicial system.
2,4,1,I don't think "It was his time" will sway the jury.
3,0,0,He's not buying the "It's my job" argument.
3,1,0,We'll ask for separate trials on each count.
2,2,0,You got life.
5,0,2,Please try to cut back on the ominous pointing today.
2,1,0,I don't think you're getting out of this unscythed
7,1,1,It's "So help me God." You don't have to mean it.
2,0,0,I advise avoiding eye contact with the jury.
3,0,1,Since the hood didn't fit, they must acquit.
2,2,0,No, you can't request the death penalty as damages in a civil trial.
3,0,0,For the last time, nobody cares that you invented the hoodie.
2,0,0,I think our best bet is for you to just plead the 5th
3,1,0,You're dead to me.
2,0,0,I get it, but I'm on track for partner.
3,0,0,Tax evasion? Really?
2,2,0,Any chance juror #6 won't still be with us by the end of the trial?
3,1,0,I suggest you plead the Fifth Circle of Hell.
2,0,0,Are you still hanging around? There's no death penalty in New York.
3,1,1,Of course I said "coat and tie" and not "cloak and scythe."
2,0,0,It's cool. You'll get your scythe back on the way out.
3,1,0,It's a capital case! You might have to 'do' yourself, mister I'm so tough!
3,0,0,Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're gonna go with the death penalty.
3,0,1,That "Line Up" ID certainly is not going to help our case.
4,0,0,Pretrial focus groups found your outfit off-putting.
3,0,0,So this is the hoodie with the six-month wait list that everyone is talking about?
3,0,1,Remember, when you take the stand don't act proud.
3,1,0,So you have no objections to an insanity defense?
3,1,1,They want to sentence you to life. How ironic is that?
2,0,0,Just remember, you were home with your mother watching Judge Judy.
2,0,0,You can't REQUEST a death sentence!
2,0,0,This is my formal hoodie.
2,3,0,Good news, it's only the death penalty.
3,0,0,Good news. Several jurors are Trump voters.
3,1,0,A guilty plea will get you life.
3,1,0,All in all, your chances are pretty good...considering they didn't find a sicle.
2,0,0,I want a different lawyer for the punishment phase.
3,0,0,A visage less grim might reap a more favorable impression from the jurors.
3,1,0,You have no peers.
3,1,0,Yes, it would be ironic if you got the death penalty.
5,0,0,To win this case you'll have to remove the hoodie!
2,1,0,Don't come out unless you hear "summary judgment".
2,0,0,It's all circumstantial. No skin on the hands means no fingerprints on the scythe.
3,1,0,Hung jury is supposed to be a metaphor.
4,1,4,'The good news is that, so far, no one can positively identify you".
3,0,1,Alright! Another death penalty!
4,0,0,Honestly, it looks pretty grim, Reaper.
2,3,0,'It's time we take about my bill...'
2,0,0,With the death penalty on the table, I feel like this is a conflict of interest.
3,0,0,They've got enough to put you away for life.
2,0,0,Your optics need some improvement.
2,2,0,Just tell them you lost your head.
2,0,0,I suggest you lose the hoodie. It scares the jurors.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, the judge does not believe the rule against perpetuities applies.
2,0,0,Looks like the Supreme Court is tied -- four say he's dead, four say he's alive.
3,0,0,I don't care about your image. Take the manslaughter plea.
3,0,0,I wouldn't use that expression with this judge.
2,0,0,The charge will be reduced to manslaughter if we can prove it was an accident.
2,0,0,What sort of negotiations?
2,0,0,Good news! The Prosecutor said the death penalty is off-the-table.
2,3,0,Try to look innocent.
2,0,0,nope, no pre-cradle, no post-grave...
3,1,1,You may want take the 5th.
3,0,0,So our defense is that if the scythe was a lethal weapon, it was therefore a tool of your trade
3,0,1,Jeepers Reaper, Stop being a Creeper.
3,0,0,So, should we seek the death penalty?
2,0,0,You might have a better chance if you took off that hoody.
3,1,0,When I said we wanted a hung jury, I didn't mean it literally.
4,0,1,Just because I wear hoodie, people assume I'm guilty.
2,2,0,You will be less threatening to the jury without the hoodie.
3,1,0,They're not going to care if it's your job, it's still tampering.
4,1,1,Just doing your job? Nobody’s gonna buy that one.
5,2,0,It's a hung jury.
2,0,0,It's usually the other way around, but these witnesses are killing us.
2,0,0,You are not really needed here. This is traffic court.
3,0,0,It's too bad capital punishment isn't legal here cause, y'know, you'll end up just going back to where you came from... Because you're death.
2,0,0,I don't think they'll take the death penalty off the table.
6,1,0,Remember! The longer I live the more I can do for you!
2,0,0,Eye contact with the jury is normally a good thing but the unblinking stare with eyes glowing like red hot coals is becoming counterproductive.
2,2,0,Technically, your execution would be death by suicide.
3,1,1,I presume you're taking the Fifth?
3,0,0,If the jury stares directly in your face, I'd say we're cooked.
3,0,0,Thankfully this state doesn't have the death penalty
2,0,0,Quit killing the jurors. It's a civil case.
3,0,0,Seriously, sir. I want the death penalty
2,4,1,I’ll do this pro bono if you do me a little favor …
3,0,0,Try not to have such a blank face.
3,1,0,I don't like where this is headed. What do you think?
4,1,0,I think the hoodie sends the wrong message.
4,0,0," I thought I told you to wear your white colored hoodie to court".
3,1,0,The jury room is off limits. Eat you lunch at recess in the hall.
4,2,3,We're unable to find a jury of your peers.
4,0,2,I promise you won't get life.
3,0,0,I think it will be difficult to argue that this is a prima facie case.
3,2,0,Given ALL of your priors, I have to say, it doesn't look good.
2,0,0,Yes, but Beelzebub's DNA is on the scythe, Mr. Grim."
2,2,0,Do you go by Grim or Mr Reaper....
2,2,0,"It's my job" is not a valid defense.
2,0,0,At least I have a lawyer.
2,0,0,Your fingerprints were on the chess board.
3,0,0,Not to be morbid, but you could be sentenced to life.
2,0,0,Whoever it was they didn't leave any fingerprints.
6,1,0,No, you can't request a hung jury.
2,0,0,Maybe we say it's just a hoodie.
3,1,0,it's because everyone does agree that you 'just kill' in that hoodie
3,0,0,hold that thought.
4,0,0,After your testimony, the judge will understand just who is at risk for the death penalty.
3,1,1,I asked you to wear a tie.
2,5,1,I think you need to say more than, ' I was just doing my job.'
3,0,0,You should of shaved for court day.
3,0,0,I've filed a motion for change of venue to Hades.
7,0,0,Don't blame me. I told you there's no way to avoid your taxes.
3,0,1,You couldn't shave?
4,0,0,Excellent, I hope to represent you in the future… yes we do work with clients more than once.
2,0,0,We might avoid the death penalty if you plead guilty to tax evasion.
2,2,0,I told the judge you'd be willing to extend his life sentence if he gets rid of yours.
5,1,0,When I said 'Wear your dark suit,' I meant the Brooks Brothers one.
2,0,0,Well , you reap what sow and no you will not testify !
4,1,0,We're going with a Lawful Capacity of Office defense, you were just doing your job
2,0,0,Don't worry, I've got a call into Netflix.
2,0,0,No, 'untill death do us part' was binding
2,0,0,You feel a draft?
2,2,0,You think Juror Six can be gotten to?
2,4,0,I feel like I'm playing devil's advocate here.
3,1,0,Just remember, you might be facing death...but so is the judge when he talks to you...
2,2,0,I'm sorry. But the irony would be too much to ask the judge to overturn your life- in-prison sentence, just because you hate orange.
4,2,0,Let's open with a statement about all the times when you changed your mind.
2,0,0,Just tell the jurors about your troubled childhood. It always works.
3,0,0,We'll get the trial moved to another planet
2,0,0,Should I play the death card?
3,0,0,How are my chances?
2,0,0,I'm not worried about the Grim Reaper thing, I'm worried about the hoodie.
3,0,1,Well, it's "death penalty" with a lower-case "d" so your brand is still safe.
2,0,0,Relax... that facial recognition software will not incriminate you.
4,0,0,I want to help you, but when I say to give up the hoodie for a suit--just this once--that's what I mean.
3,0,0,You're looking at Life without a plea.
2,3,0,On the good side, nobody can identify you for sure.
4,0,2,Good news. The prosecutor agreed to the death penalty.
3,1,0,Just think of it this way, a life time career doing what you love.
2,2,0,We can't just ask for the death penalty as our first motion.
2,0,0,We could argue no one actually saw you.
3,0,1,No. I wouldn't suggest you try to make eye contact with the jurors.
3,1,0,No, you can't claim Habeas Corpses.
3,1,1,It would help if your alibi didn't involve killing other people.
10,0,0,I'm having second thoughts on our defense strategy as far as swapping clothing.
3,0,0,There's no law against cheating death, unfortunately.
2,0,0,Yes, I DO find it ironic that you'll be carrying out your own sentence.
2,0,0,Well, the jury really heard our expert on the constitutional right to own and use a scythe, and I think it would be a huge mistake to put you on the stand.
2,0,0,It's grimmer than we thought.
3,3,1,They've offered the death sentence if you'll plead guilty. It's a win win.
3,1,0,Will you be involved with jury selection?
2,0,0,Ordinarily, capital offenses don’t augur favorable outcomes
3,1,0,Yes, I’d say it DOES look bad for you.
2,0,0,This is traffic court. The death penalty case is down the hall.
3,0,0,Remember what I told you. When you take the stand, it's all about eye contact with the jury.
3,0,0,Remember, if we win, no high fives. Paralegals don't grow on trees.
2,0,0,Do you really think it's going that bad?
2,2,0,The judge gave you life...but don't worry, it isn't what you think.
2,0,0,Unfortunately, it's looking like he can cheat you.
3,1,0,A concrete metaphor comes to mind....
6,0,0,That character witness you gave us has a stygian address.
3,0,0,I think we'll just skip the character witness part.
5,0,0,Do you think they'll sentence me to life?
6,0,0,Shouting "death to all mortals" really isn't helping your case, Larry.
2,0,0,I'd say our chances of an acquittal are looking Grim.
2,0,0,THIS WILL BE A WIN FOR OUR SIDE, NOBODY RECOGNIZED YOU AT THE LINE UP.
3,0,0,Please! You can't let them give me the life penalty. I still have so much more to do in death.
4,0,0,The jury thinks you are a hoodlum.
3,0,0,You left your scythe where?
4,0,0,The good news is: they don't really have anything on you.
2,2,0,This is going to be so ironic if you get the death penalty.
2,2,0,If we lose this case, you're dead to me.
3,0,1,Seriously? Even the judge's childhood pet gerbil?
6,0,0,Calm down, I'm pretty sure the death penalty isn't an option.
3,0,0,As your atourney, I'm advising you to plead innocent. It's not your fault that people don't get Existentialism!
3,0,0,We've got to drag this out. January, and Baby New Year will be out to vouch for you.
3,0,0,I'm not asking for the death penalty
2,0,0,No, you can't tamper with the jury just because they're hung.
3,0,0,They agree to drop the weapons charge if you plea to the lesser, failure to appear in court.
2,0,0,They're probably going to ask for the death sentence.
14,0,0,Another accident, huh? The judge won't let you plead The Fifth again!
3,3,1,Jury of your peers? Ah... I don't think so.
2,0,0,Just keep a blank face.
2,2,0,Would you settle for life?
3,0,0,Sure, I'm going to close strong--but not that strong.
2,3,0,I'm going to be honest -- it's looking grim.
2,0,0,Potter's going to testify. You'd better take the deal.
2,2,0,Trust me, the facts speak for themselve.
3,0,0,You're lucky we're in Nebraska, where you're protected by the concealed-scythe law.
2,0,0,No I am sure you can't seek the death penalty for a parking violation
3,0,0,I'm not sure you have the stomach for this.
4,0,2,Don't worry. Taxes has agreed to testify.
3,1,0,The good news is, we should be done by lunch.
3,1,1,No, a hung jury does not mean they all die.
2,0,0,No, it is not customary for the defendant to shake the prosecutor’s hand when the trial is over.
2,0,0,Life insurance at my age? I don't think so.
2,0,0,And remember don't say anything until I ask you to explain why Frank isn't here.
3,0,0,I can't defend you if you keep killing the prosecutors.
2,0,0,No, no. They're saying they want to give YOU the death penalty.
2,0,0,Take the plea and you're looking at life.
2,0,0,Good news: your prints weren't on the scythe.
3,1,0,'Their time was up' is not a good defense.
3,0,1,I think we'd have better luck if you lost the hoodie.
2,0,0,Go against the 8th if you want. To me, looking at that mole on your hoodie? Cruel, Unusual and DISTURBING, son!
3,0,1,I told you to wear a shirt and tie... and for Pete's sake don't bring that scythe again.
2,0,0,Yes, the jury of your peers means 12 people just like you.
2,0,0,I appreciate the enthusiasm, but it's going to take around 15 years and a few botched attempts first.
4,3,7,It looked like you convinced the older jurors.
5,0,0,I'm pleading life. You okay with that?
3,1,0,I thought we talked about wearing a hoodie to court...
3,0,0,Tomorrow leave the scythe at home...your at work...this is a court house...mmmk?
4,1,0,This is not a good time.
3,1,0,What's with the outfit? Do you have a death wish?
3,0,0,So you're taking the fifth?
3,1,0,Thank god, any mention of Death penalty is off the table.
2,0,0,I want to make death great again.
2,0,0,Yes. Getting the Death Penalty would be ironic.
2,0,0,The you penalty is on the table.
3,0,0,As your council I think its best not bring up Obi-Wan Kenobi
4,0,0,I think I can get you off with life, pardon the pun, in prison.
3,1,0,Lots of guys look like me.
4,0,0,We'll convince the jury that "wrongful" is hate speech.
2,0,0,I'm working to get the "your" penalty off the table".
2,2,0,Are you really suggesting "depraved indifference"?
3,0,0,The defense wants to take you off the table.
3,0,0,They're asking for a continuance. What do you think?
3,0,0,They're going for the death penalty.
2,0,0,The worst they can give you is life, so you'll be out in no time at all.
4,0,0,I'm not sure he can do this, but the judge just gave you the death penalty.
3,2,1,I'm not going to lie, it's starting to look a little grim.
4,1,1,If you're lucky, sentencing will take an eternity.
2,0,0,From the Grim Reaper "So... Do I get my Sythe back?"
3,0,1,You are going to be the death of me yet.
2,0,0,I didn't mean 'habeas corpus' quite so literally.
6,0,0,You're screwed", "everybody hates you.
3,0,0,Pssst... lose the robe.
2,0,0,Would it be fair to say you made a killing on your wife's life insurance?
3,0,0,Yeah so I don't think the jury will see it as euthanasia.
3,1,0,If you get me off, I will guarantee you a cushy afterlife!
2,0,0,Eventually they will be a jury of your peers.
4,0,0,I get a splitting headache if I don't have my coffee.
2,0,0,From here on, I hope you'll dress more appropriately for court.
2,0,0,It would behoove you to not look into the eyes of the jury.
5,1,0,Mort, where are the jurors? You didn't...
5,1,0,For the appeal, I'd suggest you wear a suit and tie.
3,1,0,I'm dying to hear the verdict too
3,0,0,Yes, let's go with Fred, the "Grim Reaper" isn't likely to illicit much sympathy with the jury.
3,0,0,So, how's life?
2,0,0,Death row? Well, that shortens my commute.
5,1,0,No, wearing your charcoal gray suit tomorrow is not going to fix this.
2,3,0,Look alive.
3,0,0,I don't think you have much of a chance but at least you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
3,0,0,No. I would not recommend that you testify.
3,4,2,It seems that all their witnesses are missing. Do you know anything about this?
6,0,0,Fine, you don't have to give me your name, just tell me who you're voting for.
3,0,0,You're spooking the jury.
9,0,0,Mr. Attorney, I am top donor to: Citizens United!
3,0,0,Seriously. It's called a death 'penalty.'
7,1,0,What is this Ebeneezer Scrooge guy going to testify about?
3,1,1,Remember, you're just a harbinger of death - not the root cause.
1,0,0,The deal is contingent on you pleading nolo contendere on eleven and a half billion deaths.
4,4,5,It's the jury of your peers that worries me.
4,1,0,Remember, this is just a formality.
4,0,0,I think we should argue he's "mostly dead."
2,2,0,I told you, be not proud. Juries hate that.
3,0,0,I don't care what Donald Trump said. I'm your attorney. Don't take the stand.
2,2,0,Just because is not a motive.
2,1,1,"I was just following orders" is not going to work for you.
4,0,0,Perhaps we should change our tactic, lighten up and don't look so Grimm.......
3,0,0,Things are looking grim, Mr. Reaper.
4,0,2,No, I maintain that "his time had come" is not an effective defense.
2,0,0,No, they get to give that penalty too.
4,0,0,What do you mean you didn't see her?
4,2,1,The evidence is overwhelming. However, I think I can argue that the search for your scythe was unconstitutional.
2,0,0,It's a reverse plea bargain. They want you 50 years to life.
3,1,0,Let's not mention your regular job.
2,0,0,Your chances are looking grim, Grim.
2,0,0,I'm sorry, I did my best, but it looks like life.
2,2,0,The deal is, if I get you off, I never see you again.
3,1,0,Your moral objections to the death penalty are surprising, but duly noted.
3,0,0,Don't worry. Looking like Donald Trump is not litigatable
4,0,0,The jury needs to get to know you as a person
2,0,0,You can't deadhead the neighbors pansies with a scythe just because you didn't get Yard of the Month!
2,0,0,I think they'll be going for a life sentence.
3,1,0,Can we try jury selection my way?
2,0,0,We'll file an appeal, so try not to look so grim.
2,0,0,No I can assure you guilt was not written all over his face.
2,0,0,Lose the hoodie and their witness will never identify you.
3,1,0,No. No. No. ...No Darth Vader defense.
2,0,0,Try smiling.............it may make you look a little less grim.
3,0,0,But here business casual means no hoodies.
2,0,0,My intent is to persuade the jury that you're not mighty and dreadful at all, but rather a slave to fate, chance, kings, et alii.
2,1,0,We are going for assisted suicide.
4,0,0,I'll be using the "Because she could not stop" defense.
4,0,0,We couldn't Find any peers for the jury
2,0,0,Your Honor, you are in the wrong seat.
5,4,0,With this jury, you could get life.
2,0,0,According to the statute of limitations, you're already dead.
2,2,0,You're right. Hung jury.
5,1,0,You may have taken Habeas Corpus a bit too literally
3,0,0,I don't believe I can argue against the death penalty, all things considered.
2,0,0,Don't worry, this is clearly double jeopardy. You can't be both the defendant and the penalty.
4,0,0,If he asks about the hood, tell him you have very sensitive skin.
4,0,2,I know Angel Of Death is your real name, let's just go with Irving Lipschitz, like we discussed.
3,0,0,Now as your lawyer I must remind you that no one gets out alive.
3,0,0,There's no plea bargain... is there?
3,2,1,No, a hung jury isn't what we're looking for.
5,0,0,Mr. Kaczynski, did the lean-to have a mailbox?
4,0,0,I think I can get you off with time served!
5,0,0,I worked hard to keep the death penalty off the table.
4,1,0,Your best defense is that you are a myth.
2,0,0,I can't ask for Death Penalty...I am your Public Defender not he Prosecutor.
3,1,1,It's the Supreme Court. I don't think they recognize any higher authority.
3,2,1,How do you feel about the death penalty?
1,2,0,They're asking for life.
3,0,0,Are you sure you want to claim you had affluenza?
3,0,0,I told my wife I couldn't go to the store last night because I had an appointment with you. She told me to get a life.
3,1,0,That necktie makes you look too sinister.
2,0,0,Once again, you're missing the nuance here: Being in a death penalty jurisdiction doesn't mean you had the right to apply it that night.
3,0,0,The 'Death Warmed Over' routine isn't working.
3,1,0,Help me. I do not approve of capital punishment.
3,0,0,You are making my defense work of you seem hollow
3,0,0,Well, I'm done here. Now about that invoice
7,1,0,You're going to have to work some magic on the judge.
3,1,0,Juror number seven? Tonight? Wow, what are the odds?
3,2,1,Nothing is certain but death and lawyers' fees.
2,0,0,The fact that you didn't shave should not affect the outcome.
3,2,0,I don't suppose we'll be able to find any character witnesses.
4,0,0,There's no certainty - this is your trial for tax evasio - oh wait...
3,1,0,You have a right to remain silent.
3,1,0,I think the jury would buy that you lost your head.
3,0,0,Ah you really meant it when you said a life sentence just wouldn't be possible.
2,0,0,If we get even one smoker on that jury, we've got a shot.
4,4,5,I'll plead you down from grim reaping to simple reaping.
2,0,0,I thought we agreed you'd wear a suit.
3,0,0,How indispensable is the black cloak?
3,1,0,Jury selection is not going well.
6,0,0,Are they treating you all right in there? You look like death.
2,2,0,Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the black cap.
5,1,0,Jurors tend to look at someone like you as just an empty suit
3,1,1,I'd like to ask for a continuance.
2,0,0,'Here's your alibi: all afternoon, you were in Times Square posing for photos with tourists.'
3,1,0,I think we'll go with the 'I was just doing my job' defense.
3,1,0,I think we should cop a plea and hope for the death penalty.
2,0,0,I told you yesterday that it's okay to wear white after Easter.
3,1,0,We all have a job to do,
2,0,0,Due to your inability to pay, you're better off pleading guilty to the theft of 100 billion souls.
3,1,0,Yes, but the irony of your getting the death penalty would be amazing.
3,2,0,Great, give them the vacant look when they ask you where you were the night of the murder.
3,0,0,You do know that petty theft is not a capital offense?
3,0,1,You don't have much of a murder case here, I think we should go with insanity.
2,2,0,I suppose the Legend of Sleepy Hillow defense is an idea
5,0,0,We like your positive message about capital punishment; we just don't think you're the right messenger.
2,0,0,If the hoodie does not fit, they will NOT acquit!
2,2,0,Please stop challenging the prosecutor to a game of chess.
4,3,0,Suppose I plead guilty to taxes.
2,0,0,No, you cannot dig up any witnesses.
3,0,0,And try to keep a non-threatening expression on your face.
3,1,0,I assume avoiding the death penalty isn't a priority.
2,0,0,The best I can get for you is life without parole.
5,0,0,They ruled a mistrial on the death penalty case a little late.
2,0,0,I'm sorry to inform you that you've been given the life penalty.
3,0,0,Well, at least we don't have to worry about capital punishment.
4,0,0,I think you'll do well in the witness protection program.
2,2,0,Don't worry, they only got you on tax evasion.
2,2,0,If we can convince them you're Death, they'll probably give you Life.
2,2,0,Tax evasion? Really? You of all people should know the certainty of taxes.
3,1,0,In a word, grim.
3,0,1,My clients don't usually ask for the death penalty
2,0,0,Don't worry, Mr. Death-Rabinowitz. Spousal privilege applies to gay marriages, too, so you won't even have to testify.
2,0,0,It doesn't look good, Sir.
2,0,0,So you say in Hell there are ONLY attorneys or there's just a special place for us there?
4,0,0,Don't worry. The death panalty's off the table.
3,1,0,The judge wants to know what your reaction to a death penalty would be?
4,0,0,Relax, when they ask the witness to point to the accused, just pull the hoody off, I'll have you home before dinner.
3,0,0,You're lucky, the capital punishment is not permitted in this state...
2,0,0,How does the death penalty sit with you?
5,0,0,You've taken this Niqab thing to a whole new level.
2,0,0,We're looking at manslaughter, assisted suicide. You good with that?
3,0,0,Don't worry, they have no positive ID on you.
2,0,0,Just telling you, this judge doesn't like hoodies
5,0,0,This plea deal will knock a few thousand years off your sentence.
2,0,0,Dont worry, in this state they can't penalize you.
2,0,0,You're looking at five to eternity.
2,0,0,Their not buying your "Devil made me do it" defense. What else ya got?
2,0,0,As your attorney, I must advise you to stop pointing to the jurors.
3,0,0,Hung Jury is just an expression.
2,0,0,Personally, I don't thick they can touch you.
3,0,0,The hoody doesn't help.
2,2,0,They'll drop the charges if you help with these 7,000 cold cases.
2,2,0,I guess a death sentence is redundant.
2,0,0,No, it won't help to pay each of the jurors a visit.
3,1,0,ALL of them?
2,0,0,I told you the metal detectors might get your sickle.
2,0,0,If things go well for you I think we can get the judge to settle for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Visting a cancer ward is not a good alibi.
3,0,0,Yes, I did get Taxes off, but you're not going to be that easy.
4,0,0,This killing spree that they're alleging... Can you tell me how far back it goes?
3,1,0,Their facial-recognition evidence is pretty thin.
2,2,0,Excuse me your honor. My client just lost his head for a moment.
2,0,0,We're definitely going to need additional counsel for the penalty phase.
6,0,0,When I said our best hope was for a hung jury, I didn't mean it literally.
2,0,0,"He knew I was coming for him," is not a defense.
3,1,0,They don't take kindly to hoodies in the courtroom.
6,0,0,Try not to touch anything.
3,0,0,Your prospects look grim.
2,0,0,Why are you giving me a blank look? Don't you understand the charges?
3,1,0,It doesn't look good. Instead of the death penalty, they're offering life in prison.
2,1,0,Please stop giggling every time the word death is mentioned.
3,0,0,On the other hand, 'taking the fifth' is what got you here in the first place.
4,0,1,Well, maybe if you didn't look so grim, we could get the jury on our side.
2,2,0,Your case looks grim, Mr. Reaper.
2,0,0,Just because it's a death penalty case doesn't mean I need a second chair!
4,0,0,Charlie, most people who plead not-guilty wear suits.
4,1,0,Are you seriously asking me if you're going to get the death sentence?
3,1,0,Look straight ahead and don't worry about any eyewitnesses.
2,0,0,I hope you were one of the dead lawyers on ocean's bottom. We need a good start here.
4,0,0,Traces of your DNA have not only been found at the scene of this murder, but at every murder ever.
5,1,0,I can't keep objecting each time they say, "Death Penalty."
3,1,0,No witness. No DNA. No case!
3,0,0,The jury's going to want to know if you're in favor of the Death Penalty.
3,1,0,Your mouthwash ain't cuttin it!
3,2,1,Thanks for not bringing the scythe today.
3,1,0,They can't see past the hoodie.
4,0,0,dont worry you will get time off for good behaviour
3,1,1,So what if I didn't help you in my last incarnation. I promise to do better this time.
2,2,0,No, I'm afraid that won't work - they'll see right through you.
2,0,0,you say you had experience in high crime cases !
3,0,1,I thought I advised you not to wear your hoodie.
3,1,1,'Let me do the talking now, Donald'
2,0,0,Would you settle for life without possibility of parole?
3,1,0,I'm not worried if YOU get the death penalty.
3,0,0,They're seeking the undeath penalty, but you can always appeal your resurrection.
2,0,0,You're lookin' at life. Which could be a good thing.
2,3,0,So, how innocent can you afford to be?
3,1,0,Cheer up-- the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,It's better for our case that you agreed to leave the scythe at home.
2,0,0,Our best bet is a hung jury.
5,0,0,There is no way the glove's gonna fit.
3,3,1,At least try to show remorse.
5,0,0,I'm hoping they'll declare a mythtrial.
2,0,0,Can you swear that the death was accidental?
3,0,0,Unfortunately they have fingerprints.
3,1,1,This is traffic court. I can't ask the judge to give you the death penalty.
3,0,1,Any sentence will be an death sentence.
5,0,0,I don't think jay-walking demands the death sentence.
3,0,0,Ok, I get it. She did kill her lover with the candelabra in the library!
2,0,0,Don't worry, it's traffic court. The jury will be on your side.
2,0,0,Might as well risk the death penalty.
4,2,2,How about, "If the hood fits, you must acquit."
2,4,0,I was hoping you would wear your blue suit with the red tie.
3,0,0,I found it very difficult to find character references to defend you.
2,2,0,About my bill, I prefer cash.
4,0,0,It's looking . . . well . . . grim.
4,1,0,Let's put you on the stand in your defense.
2,0,0,They want to charge for murder, but I think we can find a way around that.
8,0,0,So far, so good. Your chances look pretty grim.
3,0,0,Your job is to testify during the penalty phase.
2,0,0,Worst case, Prison of Life, no chance for parole.
3,4,2,Without the scythe I don’t think they have a case.
3,0,0,I warned you not to wear a hoodie! Now you're goose is cooked!
3,2,0,Don't let them intimidate you!
4,1,0,Not now, Death - I have to finish this trial.
3,1,0,My shrink tells me that they are naming the new syndrome after me!
2,0,0,Remember, if anyone asks, it's not your scythe...
2,0,0,I really wish you had followed my advice and worn a suit.
3,1,0,They're obviously going to have a tough time implementing capital punishment without your cooperation, but there's no getting around the fact that you really have taken a lot of lives.
2,0,0,If you take the plea deal they'll give you life.
5,0,0,I'm sorry. The dead man's rule just doesn't apply here.
3,0,0,unfortunately, our efforts to suppress your Yelp rating has been overruled
2,0,0,Joe, let's face it. Uh, let me re phrase that
3,1,0,No Justice Scalia, you can not vote on this one.
2,0,0,When you say you'll be needing to get a new lawyer, I hope it's simply because I'm doing a lousy job.
3,1,0,Best case scenario; you'll get life.
2,4,0,I don't think we can get a continuance for all eternity......
3,0,0,The jurors may be biased.
7,0,0,Remember, you lost your head in a moment of passion.
3,0,0,Voir Dire is going to take a while...Most people know, and have strong preconceived opinions, about you.
3,1,0,Just let me do all the talking.
3,0,0,It's not the killing, it's the blatant age discrimination that's going to be problematic.
3,0,0,Don't worry, there's an obvious hole in their case
3,0,0,Why so grim?
3,1,0,So you're saying I could get life for this?
3,0,1,I know, I know. I'm annoyed it's called a penalty, too.
2,2,0,Perhaps it would help if you remove your hoodie.
2,0,0,Of course we could file a cease and desist order. or They served us with a cease and desist order.
3,1,0,...and if I loose your case?
2,0,0,Nobody cares about your puppy!
3,3,0,Let's forget about eye contact with the jury.
4,0,0,Still, the jury needs to see eye contact.
3,0,0,Okay, the visit was just a social call and the heart attack was entirely coincidental
9,0,0,No I can't use the movie Ghost as your alibi!
4,1,4,It's been difficult to find a jury of your peers.
2,0,0,Don't worry, you can only receive the death penalty once.
4,0,0,If asked about your time on Wall Street, remember what I said; you were "fruitfully remunerated."
3,0,0,If we take a plea deal, I might be able to get your sentence reduced to negligent homicide.
3,3,3,...a little unusual..the judge just asked for a little more time...
2,2,0,So we really need to establish ownership of the pale horse
6,0,0,Since the prosecution's case is based largely on facial recognition, you should walk.
3,0,0,This is going to be a slam dunk, just look at the judge and point!
2,0,0,It's hard to say if the death penalty applies in your case.
4,0,0,No problem -- the death penalty is automatic in this case.
4,0,0,Maybe you should wear a tie.
2,0,0,You're a dead ringer for the last case I lost!
7,1,1,Bad news, the scythe is exhibit 1
3,0,0,Sorry, but I couldn't get a dead person on the jury.
3,1,0,Your choice of clothing will not help our case.
3,1,0,They would like to know where you were between 1665 and 1666.
2,0,0,The jury was only out six minutes.
3,1,1,Looks like you're going to get "life".
2,0,0,I'm afraid the jury is deadlocked.
3,0,0,They'll never take your story at face value.
3,0,1,Is that blank stare is working for you?
2,0,0,I strongly suggest you face this head on.
7,0,0,It's a simple trial. The jerks at the New Yorker Cartoon contest promised they wouldn't e-mail advertising to you, and then they did.
3,2,0,If you're sure they won't testify against you, then don't take the deal.
3,0,0,Do you think it’s a good idea to wear a hood Mr. Simpson?
2,0,0,Apparently for you, death is not a penalty.
2,2,0,No, the irony does not escape me.
3,1,1,The Bible catching fire didn't help.
3,4,3,They all seem anxious to cut a deal.
2,0,0,Now remember Mr. DEATH, when you get on the stand, say only that you were following the company guidelines with regard to your job description.
2,0,0,It may well be his "time" but taking the judge now isn't going to help your case one bit.
3,2,0,I'd like to save you until the end.
3,0,0,I'm glad you left the scythe at home today.
3,0,0,Are you winking at me?
4,0,0,I should have known — everyone objects to Death.
5,0,0,You need to get your head in this trial...
3,0,0,I thimk you should listen to me in this case, a hoodie is a no goodie in court.
3,2,2,I understand that you are just as certain as taxes. But you still have to pay them.
2,0,0,I told you to wear a suit, no hoodies in the courtroom!
3,1,1,Death becomes you.
2,0,0,After this, are you going to take a holiday?
2,0,0,Frankly speaking, GR, we don't stand a ghost of a chance.
2,0,0,Drop the hood and the "Doctor X" moniker, 'kay?
5,2,0,Things look pretty grim, Mr. Reaper.
3,1,0,Can we get Scalia back, just until November?
3,0,0,To get a reduced sentence, you'll have to tell the court where all the bodies are buried.
2,0,0,Just cross your fingers that they give you concurrent instead of consecutive sentences.
3,0,0,Thanks for not bringing the scythe
3,0,0,My client would like to know how legally binding the term "till Death due us part" is.
3,1,1,So, you met Justice Scalia?
3,0,0,Tell them I have a right to privacy
3,1,0,So you thought he said "today" rather than "not today"?
3,0,0,The best they can do is murder 2. You are looking at 5 to 10.
1,0,0,I think I can get you life without parole.
2,0,0,Try not to look so grim when the jury enters.
4,0,0,Putting you on the witness stand is probably a bad idea.
4,1,0,Remember to maintain good eye contact with the jurors.
3,1,0,The devil made me do it!
2,2,0,It's an open-and-shut case. Nobody remembers your face.
8,0,1,When you look at the jury, try not to look so grim.
3,1,1,Remember, you're taking the Fifth.
3,1,0,You've got nothing to worry about---this state doesn't have a Death penalty.
3,1,0,As your lawyer, I recommend the death penalty.
3,0,0,We're trying to put a good face on your case.
2,0,0,I'm not sure that look will result in a hung-jury.
6,0,0,So far, all of the evidence presented against you is only circumstantial.
4,0,0,So you come as the angel of death to avoid doing your taxes.
3,0,0,I don't think it sat well with the jury when you said your hobbies were spontaneous combustion and Ebola.
3,2,1,You did say you were innocent, right?
2,0,0,Sure they found blood on the scythe and found me holding it over the body but it's not mine!I'm the victim here, really!
3,3,2,There's someone at my office I would like you to meet.
2,0,0,The real trick will be proving to the millennials that you're not a Dementor.
3,0,1,Good news: the prosecution couldn't find anyone willing to testify against you.
3,0,1,You might be sentenced to life...
4,0,0,I wish you had told me you dumped the scythe in the river.
6,1,1,The line up was clearly biased. The witness couldn't even see your face.
2,0,0,How about never. Is never good for you?
2,0,0,I don't care where you went to Law School! You representing me would be a conflict of interest!
5,1,0,Remember, try not to over-react.
3,0,0,On a good day and a hung jury, you might get 32 consecutive life sentences.
5,1,0,On second thought, the maximum sentence might be OK.
2,0,0,Don't worry, I'll tie them up in litigation forever!
3,0,0,So you know that they are asking for the death sentence
3,1,1,Just take the fifth if you're asked about taxes.
5,0,0,Have you considered keeping me on retainer?
3,1,0,Just so we're clear — in this room, you leave the soul-sucking to me.
2,0,0,How does death in prison without parole sound?
3,1,0,Remember, witness protection can be withdrawn at the judge's discretion...
3,0,1,I don't think the preexisting condition defense is gonna fly.
3,0,0,After I ask Ms. Dickinson why she didn't stop, you can tell the jury you kindly did.
2,0,0,I don't think self-defense is your best argument.
3,0,0,A hung jury, Mr. Reaper, is not what you think it is.
4,0,0,Your walk,voice an lack of features are compelling evidence.
6,0,2,Watch carefully. I'm going to kill this.
2,0,0,When I asked about your taxes you said you were certain.
2,0,0,I think the bribery charge is the least of our worries.
5,0,0,Was it really you?
3,1,1,Its looking pretty grim Mr. Reaper "
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but you don't have a snowball's chance in hell.
3,1,0,Inevitability is not a defense.
3,1,0,Just sign on the line and I'm fully insured?
3,0,0,This is NOT the time to take the fifth
2,2,0,Even with a consecutive life sentence, you'll be out in a day.
7,0,0,Remember, to the jury you're just a faceless number.
6,1,1,I told you, no hoodies in court.
2,2,0,Just tell them you blacked out.
6,0,1,If we plea, I can get you life.
2,0,0,I just don't know how my life could get any worse. OR I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
3,1,0,Look Mr. Reaper, we can't just keep using the old "it's my job" defense...
6,0,0,I won't lie to you. The jury's got that death look showing.
3,0,0,So I told her, 'Come on babe, live every moment like it's your last.'
2,0,0,It's all come down to the eyewitness.
2,2,0,Would it have killed you to have worn a suit?
2,0,0,It will be easier to get you off if you ditch the hoodie.
3,0,0,We can always ask for more time.
2,0,0,Mr. Reaper, I'd sat our chances are GRIM!
3,0,0,For heavens sake MOM, it's only a parking ticket.
3,1,0,Ok, we're going to introduce you as an 'expert witness' in your field....
8,0,0,Remember you asked if there were lawyers in the afterlife and got mad when I said I couldn’t tell you? Well good news…next Wednesday you will find out…
3,1,0,You better let me do the talking.
3,1,0,So, you actually weren't wearing a hoodie that night?
2,0,0,For contest of April 4, 2016: "Someone's going to be one brick short of a load."
3,1,0,I don't think they can produce any witnesses.
3,1,0,The jury will like you better if you wear a suit and tie
2,0,0,Lose the blank stare.
5,1,0,I see you're wearing an American Giant hoodie... waited six months for mine but it was definitely worth it...fantastic product, don't you think?
3,1,0,I know you want a hung jury but they've got you on tax evasion!
4,0,0,You gave them the gun and cigarettes, what they did with them is not your fault." OR "It was supposed to be a near death experience.
3,1,0,My client would like to plead not guilty by reason of nihilism.
2,0,0,We'll plead self-defense.
3,2,0,You're not helping!
3,1,0,Tomorrow, wear a suit.
3,0,0,We may be in trouble here, they found your distal phalanx on the scythe.
2,2,0,In my opinion...... your chances are grim.
3,1,0,I hope we get a liberal jury.
2,0,0,Tell Scalia this isn't a second amendment case
2,0,0,Let's switch uniforms and see if it makes a difference.
4,0,0,Listen, involuntary manslaughter is going to be a hard sell.
3,0,0,Remember short answers and try not to smile
2,2,0,Luckily, they can't extend prison sentences to eternity.
3,2,0,Well, we can't really deny that you did it.
2,0,0,I cannot file to declare you dead until you pay my retainer.
3,1,0,If you want to win this thing please be not proud.
3,1,0,I always knew this job would kill me.
3,2,2,I'll represent you pro bono in exchange for air conditioning and reduced sulfur.
3,1,0,I'm dying to hear the verdict.
7,1,0,I told you not to wear your hoodie!
3,0,0,You're certain you wanted a Tax attorney?
3,2,1,Let me guess...A wrongful death suit?
3,0,0,Now remember: When you're called to the stand, refrain from your 'Grim Reaper' routine.
2,0,0,I'll ask for it to be commuted to life.
3,0,0,I'm sorry, you're likely to get life.
4,0,2,Is this really what it takes to get a hearing from the Republicans?
4,2,1,Do not show any emotion.
4,0,3,I can't object. It's actually called the Death Penalty.
2,0,0,I told you, suit and tie, no hoodies.
4,0,0,Smart to ditch the scythe before court, but you'll still do time with that hoodie.
2,0,0,When the sentence is death, I need you to act surprised.
2,0,0,A death sentence would be ironic.
5,1,0,Did anybody see you do it?
2,0,0,So it's not exactly a jury of your peers...
3,1,0,''You need to wipe the smile off your face.''
3,0,0,Where's your tie?
3,1,1,I'm just saying that shouting 'I've got your death penalty right here!' wasn't a great way to start.
5,0,0,The only thing certain would have been Scalia.
3,2,1,They only have two alternates so go a little easy on the jury pool.
2,2,0,Am I the Victim, or the Defendant?
3,0,0,I'll ask for an adjournment, take a holiday.
3,0,0,I'm afraid the outlook for your case looks grim.
2,0,0,Did I not specifically ask you to wear a nice blue suit?
2,0,0,They don't have a case without the scythe.
2,0,0,They couldn't come up with a jury of your peers, so we're going with a bunch of Trump supporters.
8,1,0,Sorry, but "until death do us part" won't be a good defense
5,0,0,We can only look like people right now.
2,2,0,You've been sentenced to death. Then again, that's probably your call when it actually happens.
5,0,0,The defense: You are a head case.
8,0,0,No, most CEOs don't wear a hoodie to the hearing.
2,0,0,Let's not bring your scythe up to the witness stand. It might send a mixed message to the jury.
3,0,0,You gotta trust what I said about the hoodie.
2,0,0,We're short on character witnesses.
3,1,0,What did you say would happen if I don't get a reduction in your alimony?
2,4,0,No fingerprints! No problem!
3,0,0,I don't care if they do give me the death penalty!
3,0,1,No, pessimism will not win your freedom!
3,1,0,Ask the judge if you can approach, maybe it'll sway him.
2,3,0,I'm having a difficult time finding a witness to confirm your alibis.
2,0,0,Remember, you were just a bookkeeper, and occasionally helped on collections.
2,2,0,I realize that you've been doing it for millennia, I just don't think that's a viable defense...
2,2,0,Relax, we've been through this billions of times.
2,0,0,yes... the campaign is going well
3,1,1,I can get it reduced to manslaughter.
2,2,0,Avoid eye contact with the jurors
2,2,0,Mind you, outside Texas we'd call it a misdemeanor.
3,0,0,A penalty? Is it really?
3,0,0,Remember, it's "Your Honor" not "You're next"
5,0,0,Did you really wait 9 months for your hoodie?
2,0,0,There's a little problem with your character witnesses. They're all dead.
3,0,0,The expert witness will be testifying via Skype, not scythe.
3,0,0,I myself have reasonable doubt about your latest alibi.
3,0,0,Stop acting so paranoid. He's reading my lips, not yours.
4,0,0,In this case, the penalty would be yourself.
4,1,0,Doc, you wouldn't recognize me anyway. You were too busy entering data into the computer.
2,0,0,It's uncanny! He had no difficulty picking you out in the line-up.
3,0,0,The judge doesn't want you approaching the bench for any reason.
3,0,0,Okay, so it’s your sincerely held religious belief that your wife should not get the ’65 Mustang convertible, the time-share in Vegas and your 401K. Anything else?
3,0,0,Don't let them hoodwink you into the truth. Die with the lie.
3,1,1,They're offering life.
3,0,1,Tell the jury you'll save them a place in Heaven.
6,0,1,How ironic - they're asking for the death penalty.
3,2,0,It would have helped if you hadn't shown up looking like death warmed over.
3,0,1,I'm not worried. In this county, you always get a jury that's mostly undead.
2,0,0,Sometimes I have the feeling I'm talking to myself.
4,0,2,No, you can't be the executioner.
3,1,0,What happens if the sentence is life imprisonment?
2,2,0,It's not a jury of your peers, but a jury of their fears.
2,0,0,You have to start reminding people to encrypt their suicide notes.
3,3,1,Yeah, keep staring real hard at the jury members.
3,0,0,Could you at least walk? The floating across the room thing isn't helping us.
3,0,0,Push for the death penalty.
2,2,0,I take it that the death penalty is not going to be an issue.
2,0,0,But you told me the most the judge could give me was life!
3,1,0,The whole "'till death do us part" thing didn't seem to work so well for us this time.
6,1,0,Please stop snickering at "death penalty."
2,0,0,You know your reputation isn't helping here, right?
3,1,0,Now, don't do anything stupid.
5,0,0,Of course, if we win this one, we may find it to be a hollow victory.
3,0,0,What's the worst that could happen, a death sentence?
2,0,0,I'm afraid you are looking at life.
3,0,0,May the police force be with you
3,0,0,This is my first death penalty case!
2,0,0,Even though our side can no longer count on Scalia's vote, we can still consult him.
7,2,1,The good news is if you take the stand we might end up with a hung jury.
4,2,3,So your saying they got the wrong guy? Your Jim Reaper?
3,2,1,You're finished, they found the scythe.
4,2,1,Relax. You were just doing your job.
3,1,0,The Jury finds the defendant, Death, guilty of the murder of 93 billion people.
3,2,2,You realize you're facing life?
3,1,0,First thing, lose the hoodie.
4,0,3,I know you'd prefer a hung jury.
8,3,0,Don't worry - they can't possibly give you a life sentence.
3,0,0,Death and taxes, I'm sure you've heard the expression before.
3,0,0,Well fortunately, aside from all the evidence mounted against you, I think we can safely rule out the death penalty.
3,0,0,Am I getting life?
2,0,0,You could have put on a tie at least!
3,2,0,I'll be brief...
2,0,0,Excuse me but this is the first time I represented death as a client.
9,0,0,As heinous as it was, he says he will dismiss your case with the proviso you never set foot in this county again.
4,1,0,Either way it's a death sentence.
3,0,0,If we play our cards right, Mr. Reaper, you'll get off scot-free with a death sentence.
3,1,0,I'm sorry Mr. Reaper, "You were just doing your job" is not a defense we can win with.
4,0,0,OK, that might work, but what about taxes?
2,4,0,You realize that 'strike the juror' is not to be taken literally...
3,1,1,Trust me, you want to keep the hoodie on.
11,0,0,I'm afraid he did take it with him.
2,2,0,Are you looking for a hung jury?
2,0,0,So, let me get this right, you WANT the death penalty?
4,0,0,Any mitigating circumstances? We could go with Childhood abuse, maybe.
2,0,0,Sooner or later, you're going to have to face it.
7,0,0,Please rise court is in session "Shouldn't you have objected to that?" Said Mr. Reaper.
2,0,0,Hopefully the judge will order sentences to run concurrently.
2,2,0,Worst case? You get life.
3,1,0,I told you, lose the hoodie.
7,0,0,What do you think of a first impression?
2,0,0,Shh, shut up and hide your reaper.
4,0,0,All we have to do is establish reasonable doubt. Please stop looking at the jury.
2,0,0,I'll be honest, I'm not certain this judge will favor you over taxes.
5,0,0,The judge doesn't agree with your statute of repose argument.
3,1,0,Please....no more jokes about a 'hung jury'.
3,0,0,You look very grim.
3,1,0,Just because that particular sentence is named after you doesn't mean we're doomed from the start.
3,2,1,I don't think they'll give you the death penalty.
3,1,0,Ironic. They're seeking the death penalty.
3,0,0,Knight to queen's bishop 3.
4,0,2,But your testimony would be deadly!
3,0,0,Just say you were out of your head.
3,1,0,You'd rather get the death penalty and not a life sentence?
5,0,0,perhaps it would be better if you didn't make eye contact with the jury
3,0,0,I told you not to wear your work clothes to court.
4,0,0,Because of double jeopardy, there is no chance for the death penalty.
3,0,0,Don't be alarmed. I was sent here to kill the bill.
4,0,0,I already told you, pleading innocent AND having accidental involvement with everyone on these lists, isn't something that just 'might vibe okay' with the jury.
2,2,0,But doesn’t a plea bargain for a life sentence seem a bit ironic?
6,1,0,The problem is I don't think saying"I was only doing my job" is going to elicit much sympathy from the jury.
2,0,0,This is not what I expected when I asked you to wear a business suit.
5,1,0,I don't swear in.
2,0,0,Pretty safe to say the death penalty is off the table.
2,0,0,"I think our best bet is to ask for life without parole".
3,1,0,Can you work work with me here? I'm not asking for tears, but we're doomed unless you can come up with a contrite expression.
3,0,0,Look, I won't lie to you. The outlook is grim. But let's face it, you reap what you sow.
8,2,0,I already told, I'm not playing Devil's advocate on this.
3,0,0,OK, OK, we'll try for 'manslaughter'
3,0,0,I'm going to go with the "Acquit or it will be Grim" argument.
3,1,0,Look kindly.
3,1,0,I'm sorry—it looks like a life sentence.
3,1,1,Please, no jury tampering.
3,0,0,You plead guilty or not guilty. You can't plead for a death sentence!
2,2,0,But she is allowing the hoodie due to your special circumstances.
4,0,0,What behavior could even be unbecoming of a Grim Reaper?
5,0,0,Did you wear a disguised facemask during the robbery?
3,1,0,Don't look any juror in the eye. And it would help if you could be a little less grim.
2,0,0,They're asking for twenty years. I'll try and get death.
9,3,0,Please tell me you didn't hang the jury.
2,0,0,No. You do not want to take the stand.
3,1,1,No, you can't have your scythe in the courtroom.
3,0,1,Remember, our client's life is in your hands.
3,1,0,Absolutely not! No threats to the prosecutor.
3,1,1,What's this about an appointment in Samarra?
2,2,0,Honestly, he was dead when I got here.
2,0,0,Let me get this right. You want a stay of execution?
2,0,0,It's a complicated trial, but I suspect you'll walk away unscythed.
4,1,0,I know you feel strongly about the hoody but generally a jury is swayed by some positive eye contact.
3,0,0,I believe you that no one tips the ferryman. It's the IRS who thinks you're under-reporting.
3,1,0,I think I can get you eternity without parole.
3,0,0,Their case for accessory after the fact is looking pretty strong
3,1,0,We need the jury on your side. Relax, smile, and stop killing them.
2,0,0,I can get the death penalty off the table but your going to have to stand .
3,3,2,Juries can be tough on repeat offenders.
2,0,0,I have a sure-fire closing argument that has worked in even tougher cases than this: If the glove don't fit … .
4,0,0,I'd advise against asking the judge whether your hoodie makes your face look fat.
3,1,0,Don't worry about it. They can't even spell "scythe".
3,1,0,If they give you a life sentence, try not to laugh.
3,0,0,No, we could not find one juror who had not experienced your work in their own lives.
2,2,0,We're gonna have to work on your image.
2,0,0,They have a point. Who else uses a scyth?
2,0,0,If I get you out of this one, it changes everything.
2,0,0,Your case is looking pretty grim, Reaper
3,1,0,We plan to appeal on the grounds that you cannot be sentenced to yourself.
3,0,0,Trust me. I've been watching the O.J. tv trial!
4,2,3,Try to stop smiling every time he says 'death penalty'.
3,0,0,You may have to face a jury
8,1,1,I thought we talked about the hoodie.
3,1,0,That's not exactly what 'hung jury' means, but I still think it's our best chance.
3,1,0,From one lawyer to another.....
2,0,0,The whole innocent until proven guilty thing will go smoother if you lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,I'm feeling sort of grim about the verdict.
3,0,0,Been a pro-bono prosecutor very long?
2,0,0,Can't you read? I texted you to look broody, gloomy and moody, but NOT to wear a hoodie!
6,0,0,Mister Death, even you have to pay your taxes.
3,1,0,You know on the stand, you'll have to bare your soul
2,0,0,Ah hell, let's put you on the stand. What do we have to lose?
3,0,0,Sorry. Only the judge is allowed to wear a robe.
5,0,0,You were expecting a change of venue...to WHERE?
2,2,0,There is precedent - if the mask doesn't fit, they must acquit
2,0,0,I told you to wear something professional.
3,0,0,Bad nose job or not, this outfit isn't helping our case
3,1,0,The cloak is not helping your case.
3,1,0,No fingerprints on the sickle, right?
2,0,0,Actually, a life sentence would be an absolution.
3,1,0,O.K!, O.K!, pro bono it is.
6,0,0,No offense... At least it's not the death penalty
3,0,0,I'm actually just entering this to test something on the site sorry Colin
4,0,0,Thanks again for flying up from Texas on such short notice to handle my appeal.
3,0,0,I think you're going to like your sentence
4,1,0,Don't worry. The death penalty was repealed here years ago.
4,0,0,Go with the judge. A jury won't order an injunction on a fountain of youth.
2,2,0,I think you're looking at the death penalty.
3,0,0,Yes, I suppose the fact that all the possible witnesses are dead could be considered a good thing.
3,0,0,Don't destroy a good story with the truth.
3,2,1,I'm afraid we can't get you on death row.
3,0,0,Don't worry about the death penalty
3,0,1,... would a change of clothing have really killed you?
4,0,1,Looks like your only chance is a hung jury.
3,0,0,You were the last ghost to see Scrooge alive, No one's buying that he woke up happy.
3,0,1,Let's discuss the meaning of "life".
4,0,0,As a personal favor to me, I have this ex that is a real pain. If you know what I mean.
3,2,2,Ironically, they're giving you life.
2,0,0,Honestly, I really don't expect this to go well.
2,0,0,We're still having trouble getting a jury of your peers.
2,0,0,So you think our case is dead?
5,0,0,The title of the song was "Eyes Without a Face." Doesn't apply.
3,1,0,What exactly do you mean, "bored to death"?
6,0,0,So, you WANT the death penalty?
2,0,0,Remember, they were already dead when you showed up.
4,0,0,The only character witness we could find is Scrooge.
2,0,0,Let's go with the hoodie on.
3,1,0,You should take life.
2,0,0,My advice, Mr. Reaper, is to lose the hoodie.
2,1,0,Bad news from the DA: the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,Would it have killed you to wear a coat and tie?
2,0,0,When I said 'business attire' I meant a suit.
3,0,0,You're sure you want to go for the death sentence?
8,2,0,But wouldn't taking the judges soul just prove their case?
2,0,0,This is going to be awkward when they tell you to face the jury during sentencing.
3,1,1,You're going to have to stop saying, "No lives matter".
3,1,0,Remember, "The pending legislation does NOT create death panels."
3,0,0,This not going well - the jury thinks you're just an empty suit, er, hoodie.
3,0,0,Your scythe set off the metal detectors, huh?
2,0,0,This will not be that long a trial!
3,1,0,Be sure to make eye contact with the jurors.
3,0,0,Sorry, Death, you have been sentenced to life.
6,1,0,I wouldn't worry about getting the death penalty.
4,0,0,Hey, buddy. I know you were just minding your business, but they'll arrest any dark figure wearing a hoodie.
4,2,1,There's no DNA, so just say the scythe doesn't belong to you.
3,0,1,I'll call you as an expert witness during the penalty phase.
2,0,0,Sorry, but they don't give the death penalty for failing to return a lawn mower.
3,1,0,If only we could stop the next witness from testifying.
5,1,0,Usually I advise against plea bargaining for the death penalty for a parking violation.
3,0,0,I'll testify I've never stepped foot in Sleepy Hollow. I can't speak for the horse.
2,2,0,I think the best we can hope for is a hung jury.
2,0,0,Relax—this judge is on record as being against the death penalty.
3,0,1,Enough with this alias stuff. No one's gonna believe you're the Grime Reaper.
2,0,0,If you could just put a face on the argument. . .
4,0,0,"I understand you run a shell company in Panama.
3,1,0,I'm going to try and get the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,Ahhh the hoodie! I told you not to wear the hoodie.
2,2,0,Trust me, changing your name to "Morose Reaper" will endear you to this jury!
7,1,1,as your lawyer I have to tell you that your outlook is very Grimm
2,2,0,The hoodie scares people.
2,2,0,What do you mean, you WANT life?
2,0,0,I don't think it is a defense that you were just doing your job.
3,0,0,On the upside, the death penalty's of the table. On the not so great side, you could get 25 years to eternity in Hell.
4,0,2,Apparently, the court is having a problem finding unbiased jurors.
3,1,0,Relax! There's no way they'll be able to make a positive ID.
4,0,0,The problem is your alibi's dead too.
4,0,0,I think we can pretty much rule out the death penalty.
3,0,0,You have no chance of suing an airport because you were not allowed to board.
2,3,0,Do your best to avoid eye contact
4,0,0,It's not you. It's your name. This is a political correctness trial. They now want to call you, "The Reaper".
2,4,0,It's kind of ironic that you got life.
3,0,1,Am I here for you or are you here for me?
2,0,0,You're the reason blind submissions don't work.
8,1,0,So, your saying no need to bother taking the 5th. Hmmm.
3,0,0,No, having drinks with Freddy Krueger would not be a good alibi.
9,2,0,Don;t worry, the bailiff forgot to bring a bible
2,0,0,No, I think it’s better if you leave the hood up.
4,0,0,Death penalty? Who do they think they're kidding?
3,1,0,Their case is kaput once the DA's witness has to ID you!
3,1,1,Well, at least we don't need to worry about the death sentence....
3,0,0,How long does that starching hold up?
2,0,0,Plead the Fifth.
3,0,0,...and try not to look so guilty.
2,0,0,What we really want is Involuntary.
2,0,0,Good news - they're offering a face-saving settlement
2,2,0,Remember, always make eye contact with the Jury, I think we are winning them over
3,0,0,I don't want the last meal !
2,0,0,I thought I told you to ditch the hoodie.
2,2,0,I am afraid I will not be be able to represent you post-mortem
3,1,0,Just don't make eye contact with the jurors.
3,0,1,I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to wait until after the sentencing.
2,0,0,What's the worst that could happen, the death penalty?
2,0,0,This lawsuit against you is the biggest class action I have ever seen.
3,0,0,..the judge wants to know if you "jumped the gun" a bit...
2,2,0,Remember to say, you 'kindly' stopped for him.
3,0,0,I'm going to ask you once last time—did you kill this man?
5,0,0,Make it look like the sickle doesn't fit.
2,0,0,So...What do you want to do for lunch?
2,2,0,I'm afraid the hoodie is a dead giveaway.
4,0,0,I just, I don't know, always imagined you as white
3,0,0,You haven't a ghost of a chance with this judge.
6,0,0,You know, I'm actually a woman.
3,2,2,Why don't you handle culling the jury pool?
3,0,0,Honestly, that scythe at the scene belonged to the 94 year old paraplegic.
2,0,0,Stop acting like the sky is falling. This Trump thing will pass.
3,1,0,Not to worry. Your face doesn't show up on any of the security cameras.
5,1,5,Without the scythe, they got nothing.
4,0,0,Now you show me the smoking gun? You're killin' me here.
3,1,0,You couldn't find a nice suit and button down shirt to wear?
4,0,0,Let me frank. You're on trial for you life here.
2,0,0,Bad news. They recovered the scythe.
3,0,0,It's the penalty phase I'd worry about.
4,0,1,No. The death penalty is not just a time out.
3,1,0,And don't forget, whatever you do don't look the jury in the eye.
6,3,0,No. You can't approach the witness.
3,0,0,Don't worry. They will never recognize you in that disguise.
3,1,0,I really don't think the chair is such a bad result.
3,0,0,Right now, I think the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,0,If they ask about lawn mowing, mention your Bad Boy MZ.
3,0,0,I know y ou've handled more death penalty caes than anyone.
3,0,0,The judge said 'go to hell' in a nice way
4,0,0,I told you not to face the jury.
3,1,0,The prosecution has agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
3,2,1,I agree the Judge looks sickly but I specifically said no to the hoodie!!
2,2,0,Listen buddy, I don't need my soul back. I expect my hourly rate in cash.
2,0,0,The penalty is severe. You could get life.
3,0,1,Our "mistaken identity" defense seems to be working.
2,0,0,Don't worry. We're going to win this. It's all in the jury selection.
4,1,0,You can't plea bargain a death sentence for a parking ticket.
3,0,0,I advise you not to testify. I don't think the jury will relate well to you.
3,1,0,Ya. I just think scythe or no scythe, you're doomed.
5,0,0,Well, of course justice is blind. Let's face it though, in your case, they'll see right through you.
3,0,0,this would be easier to defend if she didn't have a scythe in her head
2,0,0,Remind the jury that you also killed Hitler.
2,0,0,Sometimes there is just no defense possible!
3,0,0,OK. With this judge, "self defense " going to be a tough sell.
3,0,1,Trust me, no one will ever vote to convict.
3,1,0,I know you're an expert witness, but this is a TAX case.
4,2,0,I told you security would take your scythe.
3,0,0,We'll try to get a postponement due to a death in every family.
3,0,1,Ironic, but it appears you will have to pay taxes.
2,0,0,I haven't seen you since the tobacco trial, how the kids?
9,0,1,You are right, it does look grim.
3,1,0,Your email is Death@gmail.com?
3,1,0,We had to 'dig' up a jury of your peers...12 cadavers.
2,0,0,I'm cautiously pessimistic.
3,0,0,No worries. I'll argue that you were profiled.
3,0,0,We can try for manslaughter, but honestly, it doesn't help that you're black.
2,0,0,It's an older jury. . .lose the hoody.
2,0,0,You know, I have never lost a death penalty case.
3,0,1,We might have trouble finding sympathetic jurors.
4,0,0,Death penalty? I don't think so.
4,0,0,It looks grim, no doubt about it.
3,0,1,Try not to be so grim.
3,1,0,It was inevitable that one day you'd be sued for censoring someone's Facebook post.
2,2,0,When you're on the stand remember, it was Jimmy's scythe
2,2,0,Just so you know, the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,0,Remember, you were at home watching “What Not to Wear.”
6,2,1,All of our witnesses are dead.
3,0,0,Candidly, your case is looking grim.
3,1,0,We've got em.....with double jeopardy.
2,0,0,Death was told to relax, for he knew the security cameras didn’t capture his face.
3,1,0,They've agreed to take the death penalty off the table.
4,2,0,So, no matter what happens, we’re still good, right?
2,0,0,I know it's tempting, but please avoid using the death and taxes cliche.
3,2,0,"Don't be offended if they refer to you as an empty suit.
3,0,0,Take the plea deal and I might be able to reduce your death sentence.
2,2,0,You're probably looking at the death penalty.
4,0,0,Drop the smirk or you'll be known at the grin reaper.
4,0,0,I think we're looking at a hung jury.
2,0,0,If you're going to take me away why couldn't you have done it before court?
3,1,0,If you are not that street artist, take off that hood and prove it.
2,0,0,I think I can get it knocked down to aggravated assault.
2,0,0,Would it kill you to let ME do the talking?
3,0,0,Luckily for you, it won't be hard to find a jury of your peers in this jurisdiction.
6,1,0,No I can't tell them your sickle is a tool of the trade.
2,0,0,They want to give you a life sentence but I might be able to plea bargain a death sentence.
2,0,0,What do you mean, I'm in a lot of trouble if we lose?
2,0,0,You did copyright the death penalty ?
2,0,0,I fully support your decision to defend yourself.
4,0,1,I'm going to push the rationale that a death sentence would be superfluous.
3,0,0,I've never had a case where the defendant's name and the sentence are the same.
6,3,1,So, you are OK with the death penalty?
3,0,0,You're going to have to face this.
2,0,0,Unfortunately, it's within the judge’s power to hang the hangman.
3,1,0,Did anyone see you in Samarra?
2,0,0,"Whatever you do, don't smile at the jury".
2,3,0,I think you're possibly looking at life.
3,1,1,'I got the trial delayed until tax season so your crimes wouldn't seem so bad."
2,0,0,Well, it is an unusually large class action suit against you.
3,0,1,I know its not a jury of your peers...
3,0,0,This will not be another hollow victory.
3,0,0,If they find you guilty, you'll get the Death Penalty.
1,0,0,I'll bush hard for the death sentence, but I fear you may get life.
2,0,0,They didn't see your face so I think we're OK
6,1,0,You're dead to me for the work you make me do.
2,0,0,I don't think taking the Fifth would help. Your track record is pretty well documented.
3,1,0,You must have misunderstood. I said I am deadly in court.
3,0,0,OK, no nicknames. Your name is GILBERT Reaper....
2,0,0,This should be quick. I filed for a habeas corpus.
3,0,1,What exactly do you mean by 'a more hands-on approach'?
3,1,0,Try to present a bright picture of yourself.
2,0,0,As your attorney, I think it's in your best interest to accept the plea deal offering you life.
3,1,0,Must I remind you? Facial expressions are important for the jury
3,0,0,Ironically, you're facing life in prison.
2,2,0,Don't show too much emotion.
4,1,1,If you get the death penalty that means you get of scott free
3,0,0,If they ask you anything about Scalia, you answer: "On the advice of my counsel I respectfully exercise my fifth amendment right and decline to answer that question."
2,3,0,I'm assuming no appeal if you're sentenced to death!
4,1,0,What? You're not certain about your taxes?
3,1,1,"Our 12 friends might think the robe's cute, but the scythe could be a problem".
2,0,0,At least death is off the table.
3,0,0,"Just appeal to this judge's soft spot." -Attorney states to reaper.
2,0,0,Scythe or sickle?
3,0,0,Hopefully I can bill you enough hours to pay for my dad’s medication.
2,0,0,I'm not sure that wearing a tie would help.
3,2,1,On the positive side, your priors are inadmissible.
2,0,0,We'll base our appeal on the grounds that the jury is 100% visible.
4,0,0,What did you do now Death
3,0,0,Wear a suit next time.
3,0,0,What do you mean by jury of your peers?
4,0,0,I doubt you'll get a life sentence.
2,0,0,You should have worn the suit I think.
3,2,2,We win this in the sentencing phase.
2,0,0,As good a attorney as I am, I can't bring you back from Hell.
3,0,0,Technically, they can't give you a life sentence.
3,0,0,You know I'm having a hard time reading you, is it guilty or not guilty of murder.
3,0,0,The DA is seeking life imprisonment without benefit of parole.
3,0,0,Assisted suicide is your best defence.
2,0,0,The hood both helps and hurts.
2,2,0,Would it have killed you to wear a tie and jacket?
3,1,1,Wait, am I paying alimony for as long as she lives or as long as I live?
1,6,0,That's your idea of business casual?
4,0,0,Frankly, I'd rather be defending you than taxes.
3,0,0,Just tell them that your favorite movie is 'Death Takes a Holiday'
6,4,1,Don't worry. I'm going with the 'if the sickle don't fit, you must acquit' defense.
2,0,0,In our State they've abolished the death penalty.
3,0,0,You sure you won't change your mind about wearing that suit and tie I brought for you?
2,2,0,We're okay; scythe open-carry is legal in this state.
2,0,0,Could it be the New Yorker is "not good?"
2,0,0,The "gloom and doom" defense won't fly.
2,0,0,I'm afraid they are not buying your "I was only doing my job" story.
2,0,0,Tomorrow, wear the suit and tie.
2,0,0,Apparently, in this country, taxes are more certain than death.
4,0,0,Somehow I don't see them going for the death penalty in this case.
2,0,0,I am done with robo-advisors
4,0,1,Just a reminder, the death penalty is on the table.
2,0,0,They asking for the death sentence.
3,1,0,My top priority is making sure you don't get the you penalty.
3,1,1,I thought I told you- only the judge wears a robe. Now sit quietly and stop beckoning to the jurors.
2,0,0,I think you are going to have to get over your identity crisis before I put you on the stand!
4,0,2,I think we can cut a deal if you let some of them live
5,0,4,They still haven't found a motive.
3,2,1,I'll try to get you death. But they may stick you with life. (italicize or underline try)
3,5,1,Actually, I've never had a client sentence the judge to death before.
2,0,0,I'd recommend you make an appearance before this particular committee
2,0,0,I thought you said Christmas Past could give you an alibi
3,1,1,Remember, the victim touched you.
2,0,0,The hoodie sure didn't help.
3,0,0,Bad news: your sentence is going to be Life.
3,1,0,Let's talk about your body language.
2,0,0,I'm asking the judge for the death penalty in lieu of prison time.
2,0,0,Sorry; this state does not have the death penalty.
3,0,0,I feel it's prudent to argue "wrongful death.
2,0,0,No - Death and Taxes, not Death or Taxes.
3,0,1,It's habeas corpus, not habeas corpse.
2,2,0,These juror absences are starting to seem suspicious.
2,0,0,The scythe is protected under free speech and can't be held against you.
2,0,0,American Crime Story: The People vs The GOP
2,0,0,Just be yourself and look hard at every jury member.
4,0,0,We'll plead "certain."
2,2,0,You're saying that I'm still on the hook for this?
2,0,0,It'd look better if you had a living alibi.
2,0,0,If you lose the hood we might be able to get a conviction on the haircut.
3,0,1,If they ask what you do for a living, ix-nay on the eth-day.
3,0,0,I wouldn't mention you voted for Trump.
2,0,0,If they ask you your name is "G.R.". Put your game face on and don't be so grim.
3,1,0,Sorry, but there's no statute of limitations on murder.
2,0,0,Better late than never.
3,2,1,"Technically they aren't your peers, but at least they're all seniors.
2,0,0,Quite frankly, I think your getting off light with the death penalty...
3,0,0,Eliminating jurors - your way - won't help our case.
2,0,0,Pardon my asking, but aren't you sitting at the wrong table?
12,0,0,The judge is asking if you are the ghost who walks?
3,0,0,Try to look innocent, and especially, vulnerable.
7,1,0,I like the new haircut!
4,0,0,This judge has sentenced more people to death than...you.
4,1,0,You were right, we have a hung jury.
5,0,0,No, you can't settle this with a chess match.
3,1,0,My scythe couldn't get through security.
3,2,1,We'll have to move to a state that allows death
2,0,0,No, the phrase “Death Penalty” is not an oxymoron.
9,1,0,Looks like they're seeking the death penalty.
3,0,1,Looks like the death penalty is back on the table.
4,1,0,When they call you to the witness stand, you want to be a little bit more forthcoming.
2,0,0,This court is not the right place for you coming out.
4,0,0,I told you to bring you head to court!
2,2,0,How do I send the bill, to the campaign or him personally?
3,0,0,I advise you to take the deal. Otherwise, you risk getting life.
2,0,1,We may have an issue with your likability among jurors.
3,0,0,For the last time, 'I don't know how to do anything else,' is NOT a defense.
3,0,0,At this time the defense rests in peace.
2,2,0,Try to show some emotion.
2,0,0,At least the Guillotine should be off the table.
2,0,0,The hoodie thing hasn't worked well for my previous clients.
8,0,1,I’m sorry Mr. Kenobi, it doesn’t look like you’ll be collecting any royalties from the new film.
2,0,0,What's the difference between a sickle and a scythe again?
2,0,0,Remember not to smile at the jury
2,0,0,Let me get this straight- you plea-bargained for the death penalty?
3,0,1,Yes, it's slimming, but it's not helping your defense.
3,0,0,Looks like you'll have plenty of time for chess.
3,0,0,MR. REAPER, I told you security would take your scythe.
2,0,0,They will be seeking the death penalty
2,1,0,Don't worry, you'll get off, even I don't recognize you!
2,0,0,What happens if you get the death penalty?
3,0,0,assume you are ok with a hung jury
3,2,0,The restraining order is for stalking.
4,0,0,Will you defend me to the death?
4,1,2,Bad news. They're going for the 'you' penalty.
2,0,0,I'm afraid your case is totally specious.
3,0,1,I'm sorry but you have to admit it's a little amusing that it's called the death penalty.
3,0,0,Please Death, remember to shave next time
4,0,0,I'm telling you, it's face without a name and it's brain over brawn.
3,0,1,They'll drop everything else, but you can't avoid the tax charge.
3,0,0,I can't guarantee you life.
2,0,0,You're lucky. In this state, there's no death penalty.
3,1,0,I'm already on the dark side
3,1,0,Your situation looks grim but I'm guessing you're used to it.
3,1,0,Wrongful death is really not a good way to boost your numbers
2,2,0,I don't think the judge wants to play chess with you.
4,0,0,Face it Grim ... they can see through you
5,1,0,You've been accused of wrongful death. How do you want to plead?
4,1,0,No, you can't try on the scythe. It's not a glove.
3,0,0,You broke the law when you touched them.
3,1,0,We can beat this.
3,0,0,That outfit isn't helping your case.
3,1,0,Remember, not a word about the chess match.
3,0,0,The judge is ok. With luck, I think I can get you off with death.
2,2,0,No, this time it's about taxes.
2,2,0,Just don't look the jury in the eye.
3,0,0,We've got nothing to worry about - I convinced the prosecution that we'll only accept the death penalty if you're found guilty.
4,1,0,We'll appeal if you get life.
5,0,0,I think we can avoid the 'you' penalty.
3,0,0,Don't let on that you've worked with this judge in the past.
5,1,0,Remember, if the scythe doesn't fit, they must acquit.
2,0,0,Just remember -- we have science behind us.
3,0,0,Look, Hiram, you can't stay here: the librarian thinks you should be in the prophet section.
2,0,0,Life without parole is the best you can expect.
4,2,5,I'll try to get you the death penalty.
2,3,0,The good news is that they decided to take the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,Don't worry, I've been watching 'The People vs. OJ Simpson' we got this.
3,1,0,I said you may take the fifth not Judge Fitch.
2,0,0,Did you have to wear the same hooded sweatshirt?
2,2,0,...asking for the death penalty is unprecedented.
3,0,0,"No, a hung jury does not mean your hangman buddy is involved in this case".
2,0,0,Remember not to make eye contact with the jury.
3,0,0,He already said claiming to be the God of Death is not a defense in a court of law.
4,0,0,You do realize that you're on trial for a capital offense?
2,0,0,And how do you see yourself now, Mr Presley?
3,1,0,So, if I win this case, you'll pay a visit to the senior partners?
4,0,0,We need a better angle than you thought you were exempt from paying taxes.
1,0,0,The jurors with the 'Make American Great" buttons seem the most sympathetic.
3,1,0,What do you mean, you never lose?
3,0,0,Your testimony was a bit hollow.
4,0,0,Less grim and more sorrow with this judge
2,0,0,They need you to sentence yourself to death.
3,1,0,I don't think smiling at the jury is helping our case
3,1,1,I'm afraid you may have to go underground for awhile.
3,1,0,I'm glad you came, I didn't have a shot in this case.
5,0,1,What do you mean the sickle is the under the desk?
4,0,0,I'm sure we can get an acquittal , but you have to appear more like likeable.
3,1,0,Well, at least we can be assured that Capital Punishment is off the table.
5,0,0,Yes, I'm certain we've made a good case against the death tax.
2,0,0,If we enter a guilty plea and ask for the death penalty, what have you got to lose?
4,0,0,Didn't I tell you to wear a coat and tie.
2,0,0,I know they say nothing is certain but you and taxes, but they're demanding hard evidence.
4,0,0,Trust me on this, we want a hung not a hanged jury.
2,3,0,For the next two weeks, I'm going to need less grim.
3,0,0,No, no, don't you see? We cannot use a writ of habeas corpus.
2,0,0,Yes, your jury will be out for an eternity.
2,0,0,Your finger prints were all over the scythe, Grim.
3,1,0,Their case is strong. Brace yourself: You may get life.
3,0,0,No, I don't think more cowbell will mitigate the public's fear of you.
4,0,0,Sorry, the death penalty is not being considered.
2,0,0,Be not proud. It won't play with a jury.
2,0,0,When were you going to tell me you weren't wearing your cloak ?
2,0,0,As your attorney, I strongly advise that you stop making eye contact with the jurors.
5,0,0,Although you usually command respect, Senate committees talk over everyone.
2,0,0,This time, you're getting 'Life.'
2,0,0,Think now: "this isn't the verdict we were looking for"
3,1,0,It's all good. Ted Cruz is going to come in and sit next to you so you won't look so creepy.
4,2,0,I understand--but do your best to make eye contact with the jury anyway.
6,1,0,You're not the empty suit I was expecting.
3,2,0,I told you to lose the 'hoodie', and wear a suit.
3,1,0,Don't worry. Everyone knows you are certain.
3,1,0,Whatever you do, don't bring out your scythe.
3,0,1,Don't forget to look directly at the jury and smile.
2,0,0,"I was only doing my job" is not a defense.
3,2,1,Try to let the jury see your lighter side.
3,0,0,So, we'll challenge any evidence that puts you in the hood that night.
3,0,0,You still have the right to remain silent, but here you'll have to claim the Fifth Amendment.
4,0,0,So, you're certain, that there is no chance for a win on appeal in tax court?
3,3,1,They found taxes inevitable, so we have a good chance.
4,0,0,Don't worry. If you get the death penalty, we'll get it reversed on appeal.
4,0,0,I got this, just because you walk around with a hoody doesn't make you a criminal.
2,0,0,Can you tell from looking at the scythe whether it's yours?
2,0,0,"When you get called up onto the witness stand, do not make direct eye contact with any of the jurors".
3,0,0,You reap what you sow.
5,0,0,Just plead the fifth-it'll strengthen your case.
5,2,0,No, punishable by death does not mean you get to pick your own sentence.
2,2,0,When you take the stand, don't be yourself.
2,2,0,Yes,I think first impressions are pretty damn important.
10,2,0,Do I have to go right now, or can I call my wife and say I won't be home for awhile?
3,0,0,"Without a face they don't have a case".
3,1,0,No, we can't ask for the death penalty
8,2,0,The case is circumstantial at best. No one ever saw your face.
4,0,0,We need a powerful closing statement.
5,1,1,They found a scythe at the scene.
3,1,0,This IS what I wear to work.
2,0,0,The statute of limitations covers most of these.
4,0,0,There's no witness protection program if you turn state's evidence against God.
3,0,1,If you're lucky, you'll get the death penalty.
2,0,0,I think juror number ten likes you.
9,0,0,Next time wear white, it's your only hope!
3,1,0,No you won't testify. They will have to take things at face value.
2,0,0,Don't worry, they can't sentence you for life.
3,0,0,Please stop shouting "But I've killed EVERYONE"
2,0,0,They have no case, it is all circumstantial evidence.
3,0,0,I'll insist they strike every reference to "grim" as prejudicial.
3,0,1,Even death deserves a good defense.
2,0,0,No, we're not at the penalty phase of the trail yet!
3,0,0,It would help your case if you were on Facebook.
2,2,0,Eternal damnation seems reasonable
3,0,0,This is the IRS hearing. The Equifax meeting is next week, Mr. Ghost.
3,1,0,The presiding judge is pro-life.
2,0,0,How about showing some optimism?
4,0,2,Of course you're guilty.
2,0,0,Start with the death and taxes joke to soften up the jury.
3,1,0,Just try not to look guilty.
2,0,0,They found the scythe. We need to cop a plea.
2,2,0,I'll sum up for the jury and you take the penalty phase.
3,0,0,Do you have anything to say about your death sentence?
3,1,0,May I call you Grim, Mr. Reaper?
4,0,0,Stay calm. A 'hung jury' is just a figure of speech.
2,2,0,No, the judge is offering YOU a plea bargain.
3,1,0,We can't lose. You're eternal.
4,2,0,I asked you not to dress like the judge.
2,0,0,But the victim identified you out of a line-up!
5,1,0,You have got to tell me now. Do you ever carry a scythe?
3,1,1,No pun intended, but you have to face the facts
2,3,0,Tell me you're not thinking of jury tampering.
3,1,0,Geez, are you that afraid to face the jury!
2,0,0,Cheer up, I think we can get it reduced to manslaughter.
3,0,0,They're debating the life penalty
3,1,1,Sorry, apparently pre-reapering is a crime.
3,1,0,I think I'd like a new tax attorney
3,0,0,You're doing great. You have the jury in the palm of your hand.
3,0,0,This could be the last death penalty of the court.
2,2,0,The judge doesn't like hoodies.
3,1,1,A hung jury, Mr. Reaper, is not what is not what you think it is.
2,2,0,I'm thinking that taking the stand in your own defense may not be our best strategy.
3,2,2,So, do you have any priors?
4,0,2,Let's go with "If the shroud don't fit, you must acquit."
2,2,0,I thought this was business casual. I wore my hoodie.
3,0,0,This is the part where the death penalty is considered. As your lawyer, I suggest you consider not addressing the court.
3,2,0,Calling you "He-who-must-not-be-named" might weaken your defense.
3,0,0,Two immovable forces finally collide as the IRS audits THE GRIM REAPER.
3,1,0,Well at least I can help you save face.
3,0,0,Is that "really" listed on your job description(
3,3,1,Remember to smile at the jury.
3,0,1,It's 107,602,707,791 counts of 1st degree murder.
3,0,0,The bad news is death is off the table.
3,1,0,If you want the jury's sympathy, try no to look so grim.
3,1,1,Relax, this is a witch hunt. It's not you they're after.
2,2,0,You’d seem more sympathetic in a pastel cloak.
3,2,2,Self defense. Really???
2,0,0,Yes, yes, pro bono!
4,0,0,With all this evidence, your chances are looking Grim.
2,0,0,We gotta get you on the stand and erase the jury's preconceived bias.
3,0,0,At least they won't give you the death penalty.
2,3,0,I don't suppose you can suggest any character witnesses?
3,1,0,You're fired, Counselor, I need a fresh face.
4,2,1,They can't prove it's your scythe...
2,0,0,I'm sorry, but I think there's a hole in your defense.
3,1,1,Things are looking pretty grim I'm afraid.
3,2,2,They’re offering to reduce your time if you increase theirs.
2,0,0,Guilty. The good news is you're getting life in prison.
2,2,0,But don't you at least want to hear my closing first?
2,0,0,It appears to be a hung jury.
4,1,1,In your case I think going for the death penalty is overkill.
2,0,0,Jag tror som gick mycket bra !
2,0,0,Shall I go "talk" to the jury?
2,0,0,Am I looking at the death penalty?
3,0,0,I plead guilty to life after life.
2,0,0,If you're willing to roll on heart disease I think I can get you a deal.
3,0,0,No, I don't think an alternate juror would help.
4,0,0,Your odds of winning the case are looking grim.
3,0,0,No! I'm not pushing for the death penalty - you always want that!
6,1,9,Saying it was his appointed day is not going to get you off
3,0,1,If you're found guilty, they'll give you *you*.
3,2,0,Yes I think at least one juror is intimidated
2,0,0,I assume you're not concerned about the death penalty...
3,0,0,Lots of people don't file their taxes, so I think their argument is moot.
3,0,0,The defendant doesn't appreciate your not so subtle prediction.
3,0,0,rumor is the jury's hung
2,0,0,I doubt the jury will accept a defense of "occupational homicide".
2,2,0,Deny, deny, deny
3,1,0,The judge thinks you're a freight risk.
4,0,0,You've got to lighten up and not let them see your dark side.
2,0,0,"It was his time," is not technically an affirmative defense.
3,1,0,This case is going to kill me
3,1,0,You should be happy the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,0,You'd be lucky to get life without parole...
2,0,0,If you don't show remorse, we can still get you the death penalty.
2,0,0,I told you NOT to dress casual.
3,0,0,The death penalty?" "But this is a traffic violation!
3,0,0,Well, we didn't have enough money for Mossack Fonseca, so in your case it actually IS tax fraud.
2,2,0,I think we're okay, we've got 3 Zombies on the Jury
2,0,0,"We need to talk about your courtroom attire".
3,1,0,I'm sorry -- they never found your body.
2,0,0,What verdict did you expect?
3,0,0,No, the judge did not approve your bail.
2,2,0,Remember "just doing my job" is not an affirmative defense.
3,1,0,I'm told the DA really wants to win this one.
2,0,0,THE VERDICT IS "LIFE WITHOUT A HOOD"
4,1,3,No, you don't get off if the judge dies.
3,0,0,You're correct. As Death the death penalty presents a meta-defense problem.
3,0,0,Dude, I think that the writ of Habeas Corpus is in play here...
3,2,1,Let's forget about making eye contact with the jury.
3,1,1,We'll win on appeal. We'll call the horsemen as witnesses.
3,0,0,The judge will let you off if you "visit" his wife tonight.
3,0,0,So you're saying life without parole isn't as long as it sounds and I should just take the deal?
2,2,0,Striking jurors is my job, not yours
2,0,0,"I think involuntary manslaughter is the best we can hope for".
2,2,0,The good news is they might sentence you to death.
2,2,0,Bad news. The police found the scythe.
2,3,0,OK. Let me explain something about an affirmative defense. First, you must stop replying to every question with "Damn you!"
2,0,0,Please stop saying "goody!" whenever they mention the death penalty.
7,0,0,Grim Reaper won't play well with the jury. Lets emphasize the "Angel" in Angel of Death.
3,1,0,I get it, believe me, 25 to life is ironic.
2,0,0,I said do not wear your work clothes.
3,0,1,Life without parole in your case is worse than death as I calculate it.
4,0,0,My best argument is that giving you the death penalty would be a definitional impossibility, as well as just plain silly.
3,1,0,You want how many other offences taken into consideration?
3,1,1,i will see if i can get you life.
2,0,0,Stop touching jurors. We can't afford another mistrial.
3,0,0,You want me to plead guilty AND ask for the death penalty?
2,2,0,Because he was just so annoying? That's our defense?
3,2,1,Yes, yes, if things go our way, you will get the death penalty.
3,0,0,You of all people should know the death penalty is not negotiable .
4,0,1,We have to prove they weren't premeditated.
8,0,0,I hear Panama is nice this time of year.
4,0,2,Do you have any lighter clothes? A tie maybe?
5,0,0,I thought we were clear you'd dress a little less grim.
3,3,1,Remember, I'm doing this pro bono.
3,0,0,You're right about no fingerprints of course, but I still think you should've worn a suit.
2,0,1,I'm your lawyer, and you want me to ask for the death penalty?
2,2,0,Best-case scenario, I get you the death penalty.
4,0,0,Remember our deal: If I successfully defend you for killing everyone who ever lived, I never see you again.
2,2,0,It means, 'Show me the body.'
2,0,0,Our mistaken identity defense provides the jury reasonable doubt.
9,1,0,Just to confirm, you want to plead guilty.
2,3,0,We can beat those murder chargers, it's the parking ticket...
3,4,4,I defend politicians; this will be easy.
2,0,0,Yes, I can ask the judge what is meant by "life in prison".
3,1,0,I know you have been doing this job for eternity but as I told you before, “I was just doing my job” is not a defense the jury is going to buy.
5,0,0,Wearing a gray hoodie really isn't going to help your case.
2,0,0,Did you not read the - when it's your time - clause in your contract?
3,0,0,Relax...all the witnesses are dead.
2,0,0,Our best strategy is to ask for life.
2,0,0,I doubt they'll go for the death penalty.
6,0,0,Your outfit may be de rigueur but I think it's suggestive of the death penalty.
4,0,1,Try not to look so vacuous when you testify.
3,0,0,Now's the time for some serious soul-searching?
3,2,2,Try looking less grim.
3,0,1,I’m sorry. I thought you would be okay with pleading to the death penalty.
4,0,0,The prosecution is talking death penalty.
2,0,0,Is it hot in here, or is it me?
2,0,0,The judge is going to need to see that you have a mouth before permitting us to use the Twinkie defense.
2,2,0,I know it's what you do, but would it kill you to wear a suit just this once?
3,0,0,I am sorry it took so long to get a court date
3,1,0,At this time the defense rests.
3,3,2,On the bright side, the penalty is named in your honor.
7,0,0,Sure the hoodie hides your hair well enough, but the name Trump carries a lot of baggage these days.
4,0,0,This case is dead on arrival.
4,3,0,Understand, you're looking at life.
3,1,0,Even if they drop the charges you could still face a wrongful death suit in civil court.
4,0,0,"I liked the Brooks Brothers button down more.
2,2,0,Don't look directly at the jury, they'll consider it confrontational...
2,0,0,Don't worry, I think you'll get life.
5,0,0,You're right, no one seems favorably disposed to your actions.
3,2,0,We may be looking at life!
3,0,0,Try to inject a bit more life into your testimony.
3,0,0,Oh, just another sentencing to death row. What you really need to get me out of, are those unpaid parking tickets!
3,3,2,Unfortunately they just found the Scythe.
4,0,0,You're not eligible for the death penalty.
3,0,1,Chances are, you'll really like Death Row.
4,0,0,'So...any good news !"
4,1,0,Yes, the hoodie stays on. Now let's drop it.
2,2,0,I don't think that,'It was his time', is an adequate defense.
5,0,0,Lose the hoodie—it's too thuggish.
3,1,0,I'm sure you do indeed find it comical to be told by the judge that your case looks grim - but I really do need you to focus right now.
3,1,0,I don't think a change of venue would do you much good.
2,0,0,The jury does not believe it was suicide.
2,0,0,Judge Deepcoat, I'm afraid we have to reveal more than your nickname to get Senate's confirmation for SCOTUS.
3,0,0,OK, you want me to argue that it's cruel and unusual punishment, to avoid the life penalty.
2,0,0,Few murder victims are as persistent as you.
2,2,0,I distinctly remember asking you not to wear that.
3,1,0,Maybe we should settle out of court.
2,2,0,Mr. Reaper, I don't think that hoodie helps your image with the jury.
2,2,0,If we plea, we can avoid the life penalty.
2,0,0,Sorry, no hoodies in the courtroom.
3,0,1,None of the plaintiffs will be testifying.
5,0,0,I warned you that testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is especially deadly.
2,0,0,You know this whole "hoodie thing" you got going on REALLY isn't helping us out right now.
6,0,0,Saying "Go to Hell" is not interpreted here as "Go home."
4,1,0,We're gonna plead life, without parole.
3,1,0,No, I won't tell the judge her time is almost up.
3,1,1,The verdict is looking grim.
3,1,0,I'd say your case has all kinds of holes in it.
3,1,1,Relax, in your case the death penalty is nothing to worry about.
4,0,0,Remember Grim ... you were the first to patent the scythe. This farmer has no case.
3,1,1,We're calling Dick Cheney as character witness.
3,0,0,Settle? I don't think Mr. Webster stands a chance!
3,1,0,As your lawyer, I'm advising you, don't take the stand. Didn't you see the OJ movie?
3,0,0,That's not what they mean by 'transparency'.
6,0,0,Don't worry. The bailiff won't let anything happen to your scythe.
3,0,1,They have to acquit. The sickle doesn't fit.
3,0,0,Relax. A hundred-billion deaths, sure—but no witnesses.
3,0,0,I've told you before. Perception is everything.
2,2,0,We need a change of venue--any place that's not Florida.
7,2,1,They're enhancing the charge to aggravated reap.
2,0,0,The jury ruled in favor of taxes--you, they're not so sure about.
2,2,0,Please speak up. I can't read your lips
8,0,0,Try being a little cagey about this. You don't want them to know you WANT the death penalty.
2,0,0,Are you saying you don't want Life?
3,1,0,Just between you and me . . . did you do it?
3,1,0,If we lose, you get life.
3,0,0,They're seeking the YOU penalty.
2,0,0,Our defence will build on your aura of inevitability.
4,1,1,What do you mean you have something to confess?
2,0,0,No, you can't "recuse" the judge.
3,0,0,I say we go with the, "identity theft" defense.
2,2,0,Relax. Each juror will only be thinking about the net time they meet you.
7,0,1,This jury will not sympathize with 'a downtrodden black man in white gloves.'
2,0,0,You're going to need a tax attorney.
3,0,1,I represent the IRS. And you?
3,0,0,It's not a big deal if you get the death penalty.
5,0,0,If the hoodie doesn't fit, acquit.
4,1,2,You could be facing life.
3,0,1,They're checking for precedent on Habeas Spiritus.
3,0,0,And remember - hesitating during cross examination is the kiss of death.
3,0,0,Bad day to lose your hairdryer.
4,1,0,My client pleads not guilty by reason of inevitability.
9,0,0,now if you can just take care of the judge, we'll be all set
2,0,0,I think asking for the death penalty might create a conflict of interests.
2,0,0,I was able to get you off with the Death Penalty
3,1,1,Look, your fingerprints are all over these murders, so the best we can hope for is life.
4,0,0,Why so grim? The worst you can get is life.
8,0,1,Ix-nay on wearing the hoodie to court.
3,1,1,Their case is pretty circumstantial.
2,0,0,Well as a matter of fact, it is a capital offense."
2,0,0,The case is starting to look a bit grim.
3,1,0,I'll need a review of all 50 thousand pages.
2,0,0,Put on a happy face.
2,0,0,Well, for you, it's not so much a penalty.
2,0,0,Relax, I got Taxes off scot-free.
4,2,4,Self-defense is going to be a tough sell.
2,0,0,Take it or leave it. That's my final offer.
2,0,0,It hinges on the context of the term "cheating."
4,2,1,Just think of it as a holiday.
4,0,0,You sure you want to plead the sith?
5,1,0,What's the trick to holding up that hood?
4,0,0,I guess you know the drill. When he asks 'The Question', take the Fifth.
3,1,0,Yeah, I said you don't have to testify, but you do have to appear.
3,2,1,No. I deliver the closing statement.
2,0,0,I’ll take the part on tax evasion.
2,0,0,You need to sharpen your Scythe We are going for the death penalty!
2,0,0,Juries don't really like when their defendants wear hoodies.
3,0,0,Your ex may have taken you to the cleaners, but she can't have your soul.
2,0,0,A suit maybe would be nice. You couldn't afford a suit?
7,0,0,But she couldn't have identified me-I wasn't wearing this hoodie when I did it !
3,0,1,Worst case, they give you life.
1,0,0,Hoods aren't allowed in court.
3,0,0,Just how long have you been waiting for a Public Defender to get to your case?
4,0,0,All I asked was that you wear the button down I got you.
4,1,0,Your Honor, my client pleads not guilty on the grounds that he was just doing his job.
6,3,2,It would really help if you could think of at least one favorable character witness.
3,0,0,Looks like it's life for you.
3,0,0,Look on the bright side -- in 20 years this'll make a great crime drama.
5,0,0,I think we can plead them down to second degree reaping.
3,1,0,If you didn't kill him then who did?
2,0,0,At least you don't have fingerprints.
3,1,0,"God made me do it!" is not a defense that's ever worked before.
3,0,0,I strongly advise that you leave the hood on.
3,2,2,Opposing counsel is willing to cut a deal...his mother-in-law lives at 42 Maple Lane.
3,0,1,Try to maintain eye contact with the jury.
6,0,0,I'd leave the scythe under the table.
2,0,0,You can't threaten the judge with his soul, George.
8,0,1,Plead Nolo.
3,1,0,Try to look likable for the jury.
3,1,0,It's not the hoodie that worries me.
2,0,0,I don't want to worry you, but they're seeking the death penalty.
2,0,0,When you're on the stand, try to avoid talking about your work.
2,0,0,You ok with life, without parole?
2,0,0,I don't think that is what they meant by assisted death.
2,0,0,His penchant for cheeseburgers definitely constitutes mitigating circumstances.
3,1,0,Don't worry--there's no life penalty in this state.
3,0,0,The bailiff warned us that the judge thinks you're trying to intimidate him, Mr. Reaper.
3,0,0,If you're acquited, can we discuss D.T.?
3,0,0,Do you believe in karma?
3,0,0,No need to look so grim. But if I were you, I'd ditch the hoody and be not proud.
3,0,1,I suggest a different outfit at trial.
2,2,0,Our only chance is a hung jury.
2,0,0,Life Imprisonment is intended to be a punishment, not a philosophy.
6,0,0,They want to ask you about the custom of beheading, not the costume you wear to do it.
3,2,1,I'd suggest you lose the hoodie.
2,0,0,Without a corpus in your habeas, we better plead guilty.
3,0,1,I know, but please just say, "Not guilty, Your Honor."
5,2,0,As your attorney I have to advise you against telling each member of the court the date of their demise.
2,0,0,There's precedent for identity theft .
2,0,0,The trial consultant's analysis should shed some light on the jury's reaction to your signature "hoodie" look
3,1,0,Didn't I tell you to lose the hoodie for the trial?
3,2,1,Best case scenario is they give you the death penalty.
3,1,0,Yes, I know you are guaranteed a jury of your peers.
3,1,0,Sorry, no habeas corpus without a corpus.
2,0,0,Don't worry. Their case relies on face recognition software.
3,1,0,Bad idea telling the jury ‘All will come to me in the end’
3,2,0,For the trial I said formal dress not normal!
3,1,1,Try not to laugh when they ask for the death penalty.
2,0,0,They won't give you the death penalty shoplifting a scythe.
3,1,0,Remember to tell the truth but don't bring up that death stuff
2,0,0,In my defense, you said you preferred not to leave your comfort zone.
6,0,0,I'm afraid your testimony will fall on deaf ears.
2,0,0,This place attracts a lot of movers and shakers.
8,1,1,You should plea 'guilty' and hope for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Let's just say it looks suspicious when their witnesses keep dying.
3,0,0,Now remember, you're a tech entrepreneur and you always wear that thing.
3,0,0,We have to find a glove that doesn't fit you.
3,0,0,Ironically, the prosecution is seeking the death penalty too
2,2,0,They've offered to take the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,To gain the jury's sympathy I advise you to be not proud.
4,0,0,We're going to win so for Pete's sake keep your head on !
3,1,0,I told you to wear the blue cloak.
3,0,0,I think we have a hell-a-va defense here.
3,0,0,I'm not going to lie. It is looking pretty grim.....
3,0,0,Frankly Mr. Zimmerman, I don't see how this helps your case.
2,0,0,What are you doing here now? You are expected after the judgement.
2,2,0,Remember to wipe that silly grin off your face when you are on the stand.
3,0,0,We can do this, but you've got to lose the hood.
3,0,1,No, the glove defense has already been used.
5,1,0,Good point. The death penalty would be a bit redundant.
3,1,0,Remember you didn't do a thing. You were just the welcome committee.
3,1,0,Judge Reynolds spares no one.
2,4,0,I feel good about the jury. We were able to strike all the Blue Oyster Cult fans.
2,0,0,The prosecution is seeking the You penalty.
2,0,0,I think we can beat the murder charge, but collecting souls carries a mandatory minimum sentence in this state.
4,0,0,Good news: you may get life.
3,1,0,Levitate to the stand and show the jury that you're not just another ass in a costume.
3,0,0,We're going to kill this.
2,0,0,You're dead in this case.
3,1,0,I understand you are cold, but a sweater would have been a better choice.
3,1,0,Trust me; loose the hoodie.
3,0,0,But you are the final argument.
2,0,0,Don't worry, defending serial killers is my specialty!
3,0,0,Unfortunately, proving you're not guilty on all 11,415,521,778 counts is going to be a challenge.
6,1,0,Look buddy, nobody cheats me.
4,1,0,Don't worry, a guy like you will kill it in prison.
2,0,0,Let me do the talking. Nobody wants to hear from you.
3,1,0,Well, they can't accuse you of being a two faced liar.
3,1,0,I advise that you don't take the stand.
4,2,3,You may get life.
3,1,1,And your profession is still viewed favorable to mine.
3,0,0,So, what's our closing argument?
2,0,0,That's not what I meant by "capping the testimony."
3,0,0,I can cut a deal but you will have to testify against Taxes
8,0,0,Because you're peerless, this charade is probably moot.
3,1,0,Maybe dress more liberally for the sentencing hearing.
2,2,0,If only we could remove juror #6
3,1,0,Couldn't get a jury of your peers . The morgue was empty
2,0,0,Try not to hang the jury, ok?
3,0,0,Look, the jury knows you're responsible for the deaths of billions. So if I can get a plea deal for reckless endangerment, we should take it.
2,0,0,Try to be less foreboding.
3,0,0,The IRS will find YOU if you don't pay your taxes
2,0,0,Your brother is not feeling well and he sent you?
2,0,0,You'll have plenty of time for soul searching.
5,1,0,Grim, you've done it again. You're in the wrong courtroom. This is traffic court and that outfit has to go.
3,0,0,The judge is not going to like it. I said grey suite not jump suite.
4,1,0,You death, me taxes. Together we'd be unstoppable.
3,0,1,Lets see how do I put this,I think the jury finds you off putting
2,4,0,I agree, the jury's lack of eye contact is worrisome.
2,0,0,Interesting idea, but it's not the way plea bargains usually work
7,2,1,Concurrent or consecutive sentences: does it matter?
5,2,1,The good news is the prosecution will have a difficult time finding witnesses.
2,0,0,Don't worry, we only have to give the jury reasonable doubt.
7,2,1,I hear you, but innocent until proven guilty just isn't going to work for us here.
2,0,0,If the scythe don't fit, you must acquit!
2,2,0,Taxes got life but you'll probably get time served.
3,1,0,How are you not in jail yet?
3,0,0,We got a writ of habeas corpses.
2,0,0,No, no, no! It's pleading THE FIFTH, not pleading the scythe.
3,0,0,Look, I don't care if you are Clarence Darrow, I don't want any help!
6,1,0,Look Mr. Reaper, the DA said "involuntary manslaughter" is still on the table. I suggest you take the deal.
2,4,0,I gotta be perfectly honest here. Your situation is pretty grim.
2,2,0,You can't use that alibi. They will see right through you!
3,1,0,Worst case scenario, you'll be sentenced to life.
2,0,0,They insist you remove your hood. Let me know when to look away.
4,0,0,Relax, this jurisdiction looks very favorably upon whistleblowers
2,0,0,And taxes. Two things, remember?
2,0,0,Don't worry. We'll file an appeal.
5,0,0,Are you sure the judge will be lenient because you're related?
2,2,0,Remember - we're going for Harmless Reaper.
3,0,0,Our defense is mistaken identity.
3,0,1,Ok good news: she gets the house, but you get the Anne Geddes Calendar collection
6,0,0,Fortunately, the scythe is inadmissible as evidence
5,0,0,Don't be offended. They say everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
3,1,0,Unfortunately, I'm having trouble getting in touch with your alibi.
3,0,0,I'm just not sure the jury will buy your self-defense claim.
4,1,0,Like I said, you can’t plead 'its my job.'
2,2,0,Plead guilty and you'll get life.
3,0,0,Relax. I got O.J. off.
3,0,1,They're asking for 10 to 20, but I think we can bargain them up to death.
2,0,0,I'm going to argue that this shouldn't be a death penalty case.
3,0,0,I think you should take the plea deal.
2,0,0,It looks grim.
3,1,0,Remember Eye Contact
2,0,0,You're facing the you penalty
3,2,0,How is it not a penalty?
2,0,0,My fee is a soul
3,0,0,I swear, I'm off weekends.
3,0,0,'The justice system sucks' is not actually an admissible plea.
2,0,0,The good news is the prosecutor's taken the death penalty off the table
2,0,0,I think it might be best if we just have you plead the fifth.
3,0,0,Calling yourself grime reaper doesn't help, either.
2,0,0,Look, it's not a matter of life and death — is it?
2,0,0,No more jokes about requesting the death penalty, OK?
2,0,0,Try not to stare at the jury.
3,1,0,ECHO ... Echo ... echo ...
3,0,1,All I'm saying is that the eyewitness identification would be much less persuasive if you had worn a suit and tie like I asked.
2,0,0,A lot of my clients have been profiled for wearing a hoodie.
3,3,1,You certainly don't seem too concerned about the death sentence
3,1,0,I'm here for you. This is Texas!
2,2,0,It looks like the prosecutor is going to offer you life
4,3,1,You having nothing to worry about. The witness never saw your face.
2,0,0,Remember, you are innocent until proven.
2,0,0,This is traffic court, Tax court is next door in courtroom C
3,0,1,You have to give them Taxes, it's our only chance.
3,1,1,I don't care how many millennia you have been around or how many places you have been, only judges wear robes here now.
3,0,0,Take the deal. You can do death row standing on your head.
3,0,1,It's nothing personal, but I think I'd like to represent myself from now on.
3,0,0,G R, do you have a change of clothing?
4,0,0,There's only one way out of this, drop the hoodie and show this jury you are a man of your word!
3,2,0,I'm not sure calling Pestilence, War and Famine as character witnesses was the best idea.
8,1,1,"Keep a poker face".
3,0,0,You had to wear the hoodie.
2,0,0,I don't think "when your time's up, your time's up" satisfied the jury.
2,0,0,You're wasting your time. He's a millionaire.
3,0,1,Thanks for leaving the scythe in the car.
3,0,0,With a little luck, we can cop a plea and get you life.
3,0,0,I'm getting the feeling you want the death penalty.
3,1,1,Try not to look at the jury. Ever.
2,2,0,I understand that you're the Grim Reaper, but the judge thinks he's God.
2,4,1,Try to show some remorse ….
3,1,0,The death penalty is not usually considered a reward here.
2,0,0,When you raise your right hand, point to the judge and strike him dead.
2,0,0,Let's lose the hoodie.
4,0,4,Nobody avoids taxes.
3,0,1,I told you.....no eye contact with the jury!
5,0,0,Did you get the license?
2,0,0,Why can't I wear exhibit A, It's mine?
4,0,0,They have a heluva lot of circumstantial evidence.
2,2,0,Relax. They couldn't find any DNA on the scythe.
3,0,0,The best we'll get is manslaughter.
4,0,0,I stronly suggest losing the hoodie, Mr. Reaper.
2,0,0,First listen to my closing argument.
2,0,0,You know, that hoodie isn't gonna work the jury.
3,1,0,Yeah, it's the truth, but saying "No one here gets out alive" does nothing for your defence.
3,0,0,The death penalty? You were only charged with speeding.
3,0,0,I think you should opt for the guillotine
3,0,0,I'll do all the talking, all I want from you is dead silence.
3,1,0,OK. So you'll take the Fifth.
1,1,0,How long have you been in mort-gage law?
2,0,0,I think you should take the Fifth
3,1,0,I've got to be honest...your case is looking grim.
3,0,0,She's sayin' it was just you, her, and Immortality.
3,1,0,Gassed or electrocuted ?
5,0,0,We're going to make them identify you on the stand.
3,2,1,When you get on the stand, try looking a little less grim.
2,0,0,That wasn't what I meant by "strike that juror."
5,0,0,I don't think fingerprints will be the only acceptable identification.
3,0,0,No, the bailiff won't bring you your scythe.
2,0,0,They ran face-recognition software on the surveillance footage, and for you it's looking pretty grim.
3,4,2,Probably not a great idea to mention the scythe.
4,1,0,We'll just lie; who cares if you get the death penalty?
2,4,1,So what makes you think you were profiled?
3,1,0,The "Force" is with you...
2,3,0,At least try to look friendly.
3,0,0,I assure you that the death sentence is off the table!
3,0,0,No, I don't think juror number five recognizes you.
3,0,0,I don't think they'll buy into the defendant having a Death wish.
3,0,0,Not good, but what do you have to lose?
2,0,0,Our best hope is for a hung jury.
2,0,0,Worst case: You get the death penalty. Which you can live with, right?
3,0,0,I recommend jury tampering.
2,0,0,I believe you but will they?
10,1,0,No, Mr. Reaper by saying "Corpus Delicti" the hot prosecutor was not flirting!
3,0,0,The evidence is merely circumstantial, there's no "smoking sickle"!
3,0,0,Looks like another hung jury.
5,3,1,I'm not sure how I could get you life.
2,0,0,Try to look conflicted, it will work better with the jury.
3,0,0,Your chances? Slim to none.
2,2,0,That's not what they mean by "Death Tax".
4,1,0,No, we can't seek the death penalty on a parking violation.
3,1,0,Eventually, you know, they'll want to de-pose you.
3,1,1,You of all people should appreciate the certainty of taxes.
2,2,0,Don't worry--without the scythe they have nothing.
3,0,0,Before we begin I need to know - did you do it?
2,0,0,You understand that this whole "Witness Protection" is not reversible, right?
3,0,0,I'm going to firmly assert, "If the hoodie doesn't fit, you must acquit!"
2,0,0,Getting visitation rights will be tricky
3,2,2,If you're just tapping people on the shoulder... I think we can get you off on a technicality.
3,2,0,We're down to 7 million first degrees and 3 counts of manslaughter.
3,0,0,At least you don't have to worry about the death penalty.
2,0,0,They'll be going for the death penalty so, eh, no worries.
3,1,0,You're losing face!
2,0,0,I'm going to ask you one last time. Did you kill that man?
2,3,0,Do you think you could do anything about juror number 3?
2,0,0,Why yes, it is a death penalty case but what do you care?
2,0,0,Your sunny disposition isn't gonna win this one for us.
3,1,0,This judge is reasonable. I think we can plea bargain the charges from 110 billion counts down to 80 billion or so...
4,3,11,It's probably unethical for me to say this, but I think we have a better shot if you take out jurors four and seven.
6,0,1,There may be some lingering resentment.
2,0,0,I understand you're cold natured, but . . .
3,0,0,Even without a hung jury, we'll probably still win.
2,0,0,You're opposed to the death sentence?
3,0,0,Fortunately, this state doesn't carry the death penalty. At most you'll get life.
3,0,0,now remember-just say ooooooh or eeeeee
3,1,0,I get it, 'Death and Taxes'!
2,2,0,Sorry, but the jury isn't literally hung.
5,1,0,I told you to put on a suit and tie and get a haircut. What's up with this?
3,1,0,The IRS will never collect- its either Death OR taxes.
4,0,0,I gotta say, the case looks grim.
2,0,0,We'll at least I can assure you.... you won't get the death penalty.
3,1,0,"I was just doing my job" is not going to be a winning defense.
3,0,1,The district attorney is going to ask for life. He says the death penalty is too good for you.
3,0,0,Do you know the meaning of a "hung jury" ?
2,0,0,Be charming when you take the stand. Just say your name is "Reaper" and drop the "Grim".
2,0,0,So you think we should go for the death penalty?
3,0,0,Where you get the hoodie?
4,0,1,As your accountant, I told you it was inevitable.
2,2,0,He's suing you for unlawful termination.
3,0,0,Just trying to tell the judge everything clearly
2,0,0,We won, but apparently cheating Death is a crime punishable by applause.
3,1,0,death becomes you but let's not rush it.
3,1,0,Remember, we want the jury to like you.
3,0,0,What do you mean you feel like a dead man sitting?
5,0,0,I'm sorry but I've got some grim news in regards to your case.
3,1,1,I don't think you will get the death sentence.
4,0,0,testing testing testing
2,2,0,This trial will be the death of me.
3,0,0,Would it kill you to blink once in a while?
3,1,0,That's not exactly the dark suit I had in mind for you.
2,2,0,You're late, and Taxes had to testify with minimal preparation. Everyone in the defendant's shoes usually gets a life sentence, but now I'm not so certain.
2,0,0,Well, I do appreciate the irony. But, I still doubt a mens rea defense will work--since you, of all people, should know that you had to pay your taxes by the 15th.
2,0,0,And in any plea bargain, you prefer the death penalty to community service?
3,1,1,I object...can I object?
2,0,0,In a word: No more high fives.
2,2,0,Lawyer: "Remember, they were dead when you got there."
2,2,0,The prosecution says you should be on their table.
3,1,0,Remember, it's not a hoodie, it's an expression of your religious freedom.
3,0,0,What do you mean, there's no escape?
3,0,0,When were you planning to tell me about your private e-mail server?
4,0,1,I think we have a good shot at avoiding a life sentence.
2,0,0,We can't lose; they don't have the Death penalty in this state.
4,0,0,Eternity seems a little harsh…Can’t we can plea bargain down to time served in hell?
4,0,0,Are you my shadow counsel?
2,0,0,My plan is to use the empty hoodie defense
2,3,1,I can't believe you were picked from a line-up.
3,0,0,You're not used to it?! Just plead the fifth. It's not the same as begging for your life.
3,1,0,In the event that it's even possible, be sure to never make eye contact with any juror.
2,0,0,In America, every person has a second chance
2,0,0,You've got to stop staring at the jury like that
2,2,0,Your character witnesses just aren't panning out.
2,0,0,I think we can dodge the death penalty on the grounds of "cruel and unusual".
2,0,0,Hey, at least we know the death penalty is off the table.
2,0,0,Perhaps you misunderstood the term "Jury Deadlock?"
3,1,0,In my estimation, it's unlikely you'll get life.
3,1,0,Yes, I know you're usually the penalty, but you've angered the wrong people this time.
8,2,0,Are you my new public defender?
6,0,0,Remind them you're a contributing civil servant as a Texas Executioner.
3,1,0,At least we don't need to worry about the death penalty.
5,0,0,Let's Face it, they're not gonna bite on invisibility alibi.
2,2,0,Ok, now try to look alive during the cross examination.
3,0,0,But they don't accept testimony from the deceased.y
3,0,0,The judge wants to know why you killed those 100 billion people.
3,0,0,Worst case scenario you get life.
2,0,0,I'd like a motion request.
3,3,2,The judge would like to plea bargain with you.
2,2,0,It's probably best if you don't point your scythe at jurors and say "you're next."
2,0,0,Don't worry, there's no prima facie evidence.
3,1,0,I don't think they'll push for the death penalty.
5,0,0,What do you mean that you and the judge have 'an understanding'?
3,1,0,I think you lost the jury when you ended with "Have a nice day."
3,1,0,Our case looks grim.
2,2,0,It'll be a hung jury anyway.
2,0,0,Usually the other side raises the specter of the death penalty.
3,0,0,Professional attire meant a suit and tie.
3,1,0,The outcome looks grim.
3,1,0,I know it hurts your brand, but we should consider the manslaughter plea.
6,1,1,I have to be honest, it's going to be very hard for you to get a fair trial here in Florida.
2,0,0,Off with your head? Sorry, no, it won't be that kind of verdict.
2,0,0,Which members of the jury panel will you preemptorily strike?
2,0,0,No one on the jury recognizes your face but they all know your name.
3,1,0,It's not looking good, is it?
3,1,0,You can take that off now. They 've taken the death penalty off the table.
2,2,0,We need to get the jury on our side. Look them in the eyes.
2,4,0,Oddly enough, I'll be paying a visit to Juror No. 5 this evening.
4,0,0,We'll talk about the tunnel next week.
3,0,0,You being the Grim Reaper is not a defense in this case!
4,0,1,Can't you just hang the jury?
3,1,0,Remember your in the witness protection program. Don't give your real name.
3,0,0,I really don't think they'll seek the death penalty
3,1,0,No, I already told you. I couldn't find any character witnesses.
2,2,0,I hear the jury is considering a life sentence...
6,1,0,I advise you to wear a suit next time.
2,0,0,I think I'd lose the hoodie - it comes across as anti-social.
3,1,0,The prosecution is going for eternal damnation but I'll plead it down to being a super delegate at the Republican convention.
3,0,0,Hopefully, this will be my first--and last--near-death experience.
2,0,0,I recommend not taking the stand.
3,1,0,I'll try my best, but that's a load of parking tickets.
3,1,0,Once again, that you only hired the hit man is not a viable defense.
2,0,0,Show them the upside of being dragged to the underworld.
2,2,0,Remember, try to smile with your voice.
4,1,0,Do I still get paid if you don't get a death sentence?
3,0,1,This may result in a redundancy.
2,0,0,They will claim you murdered about 56,000,000 people a year. We counter with an Insanity Defense
3,0,0,I guess this means that the death penalty is off the table.
2,2,0,Ever since the plague, public opinion is running way against you - our best bet is a plea bargain.
3,1,0,For the last time, pleading "death sentence" is not an option!
2,0,0,It's just as we feared. They're going for the YOU penalty.
2,0,0,Quit making eye contact with juror #3.
3,3,2,"Name" will be a problem. "Occupation" will be worse.
2,0,0,What do you mean "you want to change your plea to "not guilty""?
3,0,0,..and your claim is as the ghostwriter ?
2,0,0,I should have told you - it's called a 'metal detector.'
2,0,0,They're just not going to buy that you were only following orders.
3,1,0,Do you have your voter I.D. card with you?
2,0,0,When I have you testify, make sure you look the jury in their eyes.
2,0,0,The hoodie is only illegal if you commit a crime.
3,1,0,So as you can see, your Honor, my client, who shall remain faceless, could not have been at the scene of the crime.
3,1,0,Keep your mouth shut, that hood up and let me do the talking
4,1,0,Deny everything!
2,0,0,Why the blank stare?
4,0,0,No, I don't want you to get your sickle.
2,3,0,Now you want to apologize?
2,0,0,It was consensual, right?
2,0,0,"Their time was up" isn't a defence Mr Reaper.
2,0,0,I think he already holds you in contempt.
2,0,0,can you et the death penalty off the table?
2,0,0,Remember that you're here because Adam and Eve were disobedient.
2,0,0,Oh, uh-that's not what I meant by a hung jury.
2,2,0,I'll handle the witness; you handle the judge.
2,4,1,Remember, you were just harvesting grain.
3,0,0,On the bright side, your priors are inadmissible.
3,1,0,they will ask you to state your full name for the record
3,1,0,OK. Check that. Maybe don't look the jury in the eye.
3,2,1,This is my first death case.
3,1,0,We'll stipulate your scythe is a deadly weapon.
7,0,0,My suit had blood on it.
3,0,0,Brace yourself for the possibility of a Death sentence.
2,0,0,I know it's Halloween, but no one is presuming you innocent at this point.
3,2,0,'Now look, that makes two judges, four jury members and one bailiff. I think they get your message, OK ?'
2,0,0,We don't have a ghost of a chance.
5,0,0,Oh boy... You say you know the judges daughter how?
3,1,0,When you're on the stand, try to look affable and fun-loving.
3,1,1,On a side note, keep sending those ambulances, and I'll keep chasing'em.
2,0,0,Don't worry - they can't give me life.
3,0,0,Don't worry. They have no witness.
6,0,0,Judge, I assure you he did not mean to kill that innocent girl. It's just the nature of him to do such things.
2,2,0,Jack the Ripper is not the sort of character witness I had in mind.
3,0,0,When I said dress so the jury relates to your middle age life crisis this is not what I had in mind.
3,0,0,You might want to lose the hoodie.
2,0,0,On the bright side, they've reduced the taxes...
2,0,0,At least she won't be able to identify you.
2,0,0,Well good news bad news scenario. The good news is your not guilty.The bad news is you don't get a Life Sentence.
3,0,0,I'm ethically precluded from advising you what to do, but, yes, if their star witness were to die, the case would be dismissed.
2,2,0,I was just doing my job is not really a good defense in this case
3,1,1,Yes, Texas does have the death penalty.
5,0,2,If that's your innocent look, we're doomed.
2,0,0,I think you should let me do all the talking.
4,0,0,Take off your hood, you're being insensitive.
3,0,0,Don't worry, there's no death penalty in this state but you might get life... OK?
3,0,0,Nah nah nah nah nah are not mitigating circumstances.
2,0,0,The verdict is looking a little grim.
2,3,1,Whenever you answer, just try to sound sympathetic.
3,0,0,In re: Life v. Death
3,0,0,Don't worry, life is still on the table
3,1,0,And then you say, "Tobacco? What's that?"
2,0,0,Who says you can't take the scythe into chambers?
2,4,0,So, what happened to your last lawyer?
4,0,0,No, not self defense
3,0,0,I'm sorry, but they've taken the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,Yes, you do have to pay your death taxes.
3,1,0,No, you can't reap a hung jury.
4,1,3,Do me a favor, if the judge decides on the death penalty for you, don't giggle.
3,1,0,Your prospects of winning are grim....unless it's a hung jury
3,0,0,What did you expect, in that hoodie?
2,0,0,I see you are dressed for a s;am dunk!
3,0,0,...the good news is that I hear orange is the new black.
2,0,0,OK. Death after life.
3,2,1,I told you to wear a sweater vest.
2,0,0,As your attorney I must advise you there is no way I can request a hung jury or a deadlocked jury in my closing argument!
2,0,0,It doesn't matter who sent you. You still needed a green card.
2,0,0,There's no denying you were at the scene of the crime.
3,0,0,I don't really like 'Devil's Advocate.' I'm rebranding as 'Mordor's Helper.'
5,0,1,I understand but you guys can't double park seven horses in this city!
4,0,0,I'm hoping not to receive a you sentence.
5,1,0,Are you there ?
3,1,0,It looks like you are going to have pay those taxes
2,0,0,Human Blackhole transcends cosmic blackhole. If don't agree then check with OJSimson!
2,4,1,Well no, technically, it's not a jury of your peers..
3,1,0,This must be serious. You sent a partner instead of an associate.
3,1,0,I think you're being a little overdramatic—it's just a parking ticket.
2,2,0,Don't worry, giving you the death penalty would be suicide.
2,0,0,I told you not to wear black. It makes the jury think you're evil.
4,0,0,I'm a homicide lawyer, it's dark stuff.
3,3,2,Didn't I ask you to wear a tie?
4,0,0,We’ll sow doubt that you profile the elderly.
3,0,1,I've told you repeatedly, the death penalty is not a plea deal.
3,0,0,Nah, don't change! In your case, a hoodie is appropriate attire.
3,1,0,You do know "kill me now" is just a figure of speech, right?
2,2,0,If I get you out of this, can you promise me I'll never see you again?
7,0,0,What?! you don*t have a VISA card??
4,1,1,"Til death do us part" does NOT give you carte blanche.
3,0,0,Last week I was the Devil's advocate.
3,0,0,I am sorry but the "death penalty" isn't legal in this state.
2,0,0,Best not to mention that whole, "Black Plague" thing.
3,1,0,Try to look remorseful.
2,0,0,Try to put your best face on this.
2,0,0,Your fingerprints are on the scythe.
3,0,0,I hate to be the grim reaper, but your case is not looking good.
2,2,0,I think leaving your scythe in the cloakroom was a smart move.
4,1,2,Are you sure? Most of my clients try to avoid the death penalty.
3,1,0,No, I don't think using the untimely death of Mildred Potter as an alibi will help your case.
3,0,0,Don't worry. It's mortality as a whole that's on trial.
2,0,0,Let's just say, where you are going, its going to be very hot.
5,2,0,They're not buying our "first time offender" plea.
3,1,0,Don't worry, we've got a jury to die for.
5,0,0,I believe the case with is going well and would advise you not to testify.
3,0,0,Seriously? You wear a hoodie to court?
2,2,0,For the last time, you're not pleading the "scythe"!
3,0,0,Let's just say I had expected your taxes to be a pretty certain come April 15th.
3,1,1,The death penalty is still on the table. Our only hope is a hung jury. Can you help with that?
4,0,0,You come from where? "Braavos?"
5,0,0,Again - You're asking me to ghost-write for you?
2,3,0,I have to be honest. Things are looking pretty grim, Mr. Reaper.
3,2,1,Personally, I don't think you have a ghost of a chance.
3,1,0,That's not really a fitting punishment for jay walking.
5,0,0,The court don't have no mercy in this land, either.
3,1,0,Hopefully you can get credit for time served.
2,0,0,The jury doesn't care how you're dressed. Demeanor wins cases.
3,1,0,Really, what you do is indefensible, but I'll try.
3,0,1,Well, when you think about, the death penalty is not all that bad for you really.
2,0,0,Remember, look chipper and make eye contact.
2,0,0,Of course, they have solid DNA evidence. It WAS the Plague.
2,0,0,How many times do we need to go over this? "It was his time to go" is not a sound defense.
3,1,0,All things considered, I'd advise you not to testify.
3,1,0,Yes, it's called a "wrongful death" case, but could you try to take it a little less personally?
3,0,0,It was worth a shot, but I don't think the jury is buying you as "The Gracious Reaper".
4,0,1,The statute of limitations has expired on your case against Methuselah.
3,0,0,Death penalty? Big whoop.
2,2,0,I'm not sure 'Just doing my job.' is really the best defense here.
3,3,1,I think we can assume the death penalty is out.
3,0,0,"We're Killing It!
2,0,0,So what's our plan if the judge doesn't offer me the death penalty?
3,0,1,Don't point!
3,3,0,You're right again -- another 12 more jurors suddenly died.
3,0,0,Death, be not proud.
3,1,1,Yes, you... and taxes.
3,2,0,Sorry you have to go empty-handed. My client took the life sentence deal.
2,0,0,The judge will review our motion on the grounds that it was an authorized holiday.
6,2,0,OK, usually it's good to make eye contact with the jurors..............
3,0,0,So, how go things in The Hood?
3,0,0,We will appeal the sentence unless they come back with the death penalty
4,0,0,Remember, no matter what: don't let them see you sweat
4,0,0,To be honest, I don't think we'll do well with a writ of habeas corpus.
3,1,0,Keep the scythe hidden, and try to be a little less grim.
2,0,0,Remain silent, like you're not here.
2,0,0,You still have to pay your back taxes or it will be death, taxes and incarceration.....no, you can't tell the judge your name is Al Sharpton !
2,3,0,Not what I meant by your 'best suit'
2,0,0,The death penalty is off the table since you are not an MD, and thus not qualified to perform assisted suicide.
3,0,1,I understand that you were just doing your job, but 'prior bad acts' are admissable.
3,0,0,No, I am not going to let you testify.
3,0,0,Remember: if the hood don't fit they must acquit.
3,1,1,As your attorney, I need to know where your head is at.
3,0,0,The jury is still hopelessly deadlocked.
3,0,0,Am I in trouble because I can't remember my password?
3,1,0,Yeah, but they'll kill you on cross.
5,0,0,The government is willing to settle the patent infringement portion if they can continue to use your name on their drones.
2,0,0,Your hoodie is sentenced to ten years with no parole.
5,0,0,The word is 'nolo', not 'yolo'.
3,1,0,The judge said that feeling hollow inside is not an adequate defense.
3,0,0,Apparently everyone in this class action is dead.
3,0,0,"I was just following orders" isn't gonna fly.
2,0,0,The prosecutor's trying to persuade the judge that the death penalty's not enough.
4,0,0,We will fight this to death!
3,1,0,What do you mean, "they can't identify me because I'm faceless", that's HOW they identified you.
2,0,0,Dress different tomorrow.
2,0,0,I'd say...a ghost of a chance...but.. no worries about the death penalty.
3,0,0,The Judge is willing to make a deal.
2,0,0,Sorry, you've got to lose the hoodie.
7,0,0,The theory of our case is that he cheated death and he needs to pay for the cheating.
3,0,0,You got lucky it's a hung jury, they actually hung themselves."
3,0,0,I am confident they wont sentence you to yourself.
2,3,0,At least we got the death penalty off the table.
2,2,0,My advice is lose the hood.
6,0,0,If I've told you once, I've told you a 1,000 times, juries never trust a blank expression.
4,1,0,None of your alibi witnesses seem to be available
3,1,0,It's very important - for both of us- you learn to pronounce "mesothelioma."
3,0,1,Remember what we talked about. Try to be a little less grim.
3,0,0,And again, I beg you --Please don't laugh when he grants you a life sentence.
3,0,0,I don't think you can take the soul of the court. It doesn't have one.
8,0,0,I can't believe I got a life sentence... I'm Death
2,0,0,They're trying to decide if Habeas No Corpus counts.
2,0,0,Are you here just for the taxes?
3,0,0,We'll win if you can scare the piss out of the jury.
2,0,0,I thought we talked about not wearing the hoodie.
3,1,0,I'm going to win this case if it's the last thing I do.
4,0,2,There's a hole in your story.
3,4,4,If we lose this case, where does that leave me?
3,0,1,No, the State won't let you self-administer.
2,0,0,My recommendation for you is, Lose the hoodie.
3,1,0,You're not-guilty-self is going to be much more helpful here.
3,1,0,The it's-my-job defense has no legal precedent."
2,0,0,Remember here death hath no dominion.
2,0,0,He wants ten more years. Let's offer two good and three so-so.
2,0,0,"So what you're saying is, if we win this case, you and I are good". If we lose, I can expect to see you much sooner than later".
3,0,0,Oh, stop worrying about the hoodie. You're not the Black Death.
3,2,1,Their best offer is anger management 7 times a week.
4,1,2,Don't worry, nobody liked her.
3,0,0,I know you, your the return of a ghost hoped past
4,0,0,I don't believe you're going to incur much sympathy from this jury.
2,0,0,So what say we get a cuppa coffe after this?
4,2,1,At least they cannot give you the death penalty.
3,1,1,If the sickle is too little, we’ll get an acquittal.
2,2,0,Remember, you only did it to get out of the 'hood.
3,1,1,I'm going to argue that you are a victim of profiling.
2,0,0,Well, if it's any consolation, he can't take it with him.
3,0,1,We really need to stress to the jury that a guilty verdict would be against the best interests of everyone involved.
2,0,0,Normally I'd say lose the hoodie...
2,0,0,I know, I know, he was already dead when you got there.
3,1,0,Say what you always say. Tell them exactly what happens.
2,0,0,Ixnay on the eathday talk.
2,0,0,So you're saying, you came up with the title "To Kill A Mockingbird"...
2,0,0,I thought you of all people would know only two things in life are certain?
2,2,0,I'll do my best, but 187 trillion counts of murder is going to be tough.
3,3,2,It's not going to help to tell them you invented the death sentence.
6,0,0,Bad news! The state has just abolished the death penalty.
3,0,1,Our case is simple. Facebook has no right to reject you.
3,1,0,Remember, our relationship is strictly privileged and confidential. But after this is over I expect to never, ever see you again.
2,0,0,There's no way this jury will find you not guilty.
2,0,0,They've violated the habeas corpses
2,0,0,I don't think you should wear the Witness Protection Program garb until after the trial.
2,0,0,I say loose the hoodie.
3,0,0,I knew a public defender would be a death sentence.
2,4,1,'It was his time'? So we're going with that?
4,0,0,We'll make the jury buy that the act was consensual.
2,0,0,It's not good. Word is the prosecutor is going for 'murder everyone'.
2,0,0,So, you are sticking with - ‘God is your witness’?
4,0,0,It will be hard to argue against the death penalty, especially when wearing a hoody in front of the jury.
2,2,0,Didn't I advise against wearing the hoodie in court?
3,0,1,Probably better not to mention your boss by name or even location.
2,0,0,She wants you to remove your hoodie.
2,0,0,Sure, I can do your taxes first.
3,0,0,This could take a while.
2,0,0,Do we appeal the death sentence?
3,1,0,Hung jury, not hanged jury.
3,1,0,She wants the scythe, too.
3,1,0,It helps that you're active in the community.
2,0,0,Without the scythe or a pale horse they don't have a prayer.
3,0,1,I don't think that holding out for "life" in prison is a reasonable option.
3,0,0,So uh, is your cloak Gucci?
2,0,0,The anonymous mask is better.
3,0,0,Juries respond much better to business casual.
2,0,0,We're going to hold out for twelve jurors who were born again.
3,1,0,Are you sure you're disclosing everything?
3,1,1,It's looking grim.
3,0,0,Hard to believe this is your first trial.
3,0,0,Sooo...... how do you feel about lawyers?
4,1,2,Worst case scenario, you're looking at life.
3,0,0,They're asking for death without parole.
2,2,0,Yes--I'm pretty certain you needed to pay taxes.
3,0,0,Death Penalty or Life-Either way you're out in no time.
3,0,0,I thought we agreed you would lose the hoodie for the trial.
2,0,0,you never should have popped that pimple.
3,1,0,The recess is just until your face grows back.
3,1,0,I’m pretty sure we can’t ask for the death penalty.
3,0,0,Well, you can take the plea ... or you know kill everyone.
2,0,0,I think the best we can get you here is life.
3,0,0,Face it! The case against you is grim.
2,0,0,Don't worry, the jury will love you. You're an angel!
2,0,0,"But they said it was a killer deal of a lifetime?
3,1,0,Sorry, but I usually don't recommend the death penalty for petty theft.
2,0,0,Should we cop a plea?
2,0,0,I am not laughing in your face
3,0,0,I understand not afraid of capital Punishment.
2,0,0,We need to get the jury to like you.
2,0,0,You don't have anything else you can wear?
3,1,1,Our only chance is a change of venue to hell.
2,0,0,Remember: you tell the jury you were just doing your job.
2,0,0,Would it have hurt you to wear a suit and tie for once?
3,1,0,This may be a rough go. The judge is pro-life.
2,0,0,A tie might sway a few jurors.
11,0,1,Showing remorse is good but in your case showing anything is a bonus.
3,4,2,You're sure nobody saw your face?
2,2,0,I really didn't think I was doing that badly.
8,0,0,I'll plead guilty by death through me
2,2,0,You "kindly stopped" for her? What does that even mean?
2,2,0,Just try to not smirk or roll your eyes under cross examination.
3,1,0,Wear a tie, take the fifth.
3,1,0,By the way, I really wouldn't mind if you chose to go "pro se."
3,1,0,It's a slam dunk. This state has no death penalty.
4,0,0,oh man no omen!
8,1,0,No, I agreed only to act as your local counsel.
3,0,0,I'm afraid there's no dodging the tax evasion charges.
2,0,0,I don't think the jury wants to convict you.
4,1,0,It's a little bizarre, but it may help convince the jury that you were a victim of identity theft.
3,1,0,I told you to get a new suit !
7,0,0,Go ahead - I think you should try on the gloves.
3,1,0,You may want to lose the hoodie.
3,0,0,Honestly, I don't think you'll make it. This is the fifth time.
3,0,0,At this point your case looks pretty grim!
3,0,1,I'm afraid the worst option has your name on it.
2,0,0,You're sure you want to play the habeas corpus card?
3,1,0,So, you say you were at your club playing squash.
3,0,0,I'm not sure 'the death penalty arouses my loins' won you much jury support.
3,1,0,Yes. Definitely no witnesses.
3,0,0,When the judge asks for a plea, just say "all in."
2,3,0,Finding a jury of your peers is terrifying.
3,1,1,Should I have worn the blue one?
2,2,0,You're gonna be the death of me.
2,0,0,What say we ask for a change of venue?
3,0,0,Are you sure that you're not the killer?
3,1,2,Where are your character witnesses again?
3,0,0,We'll have to plea bargain.
3,2,2,Truth be told, our chances of winning this case are looking pretty grim...
3,3,1,I think we're OK, they're having trouble establishing a motive
3,0,0,How do you feel about Life Without Parole?
3,1,0,The verbal contract does state "til death do us part".
4,1,0,Weirdly, no one wants to challenge your testimony.
3,1,0,What about juror no. 666?
2,0,0,You're lucky there's no death peanalty.
3,2,2,Remember, you were only the ferryman.
5,0,0,No, the District Attorney won't take the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,"Your rhyming attorney says 'since you have no face, we have no case' ".
4,0,1,It's a deposition...not an inquisition
9,0,0,I'm counting on you. You're our star witness for re-instituting the death penalty.
4,2,4,No, I won't say "The defense rests in peace."
3,2,0,You do the final argument.
2,0,0,The judge still resents you for taking his goldfish.
2,2,0,The jury is watching you every moment. Try not to look so grim...
3,1,0,When I said you should hide your head in shame, I didn't expect you would take it literally.
3,0,0,Congress is not technically dead, it just doesn't do anything.
3,0,0,This is a deadly case
3,0,0,Grimm, can you take it easy with the chain rattling? You're scaring the jury.
4,0,0,We've got this. He was a known anarchist and the police have already stated that his death was "accidental"! Stop worrying! For goodness sake, he was on your doorstep!
3,0,1,Best case scenario, we get a hung jury
3,2,2,It doesn't exactly help when the penalty is named after you.
2,0,0,I thought I told you to dress less "hood."
7,0,0,Now it's up to the Commission whether we get out patent for making flesh invisible.
3,2,1,If the scythe does not fit, you must acquit!
3,0,0,You said you could get me out of this!" "Not exactly the way you expect...
2,2,0,There is a real possibility you could get the live penalty.
3,0,1,Sometimes I get lost just looking into your eyes.
3,0,0,They're gonna big-scythe you. Want fried with that?
7,0,0,I'm afraid the prosecution is seeking the death penalty.
3,0,0,Well what penalty did you expect to get?
3,1,0,Listen, Leroy. Quoting the Unabomber is not helping your case.
5,0,0,A jury of your peers is out of the question. Now just sit there and try not to look like death warmed over!
3,0,0,Do you think they'll find me guilty? They Smite
2,0,0,I don't think the jury is buying your not guilty plea.
4,1,0,Just to play it safe, let the judge see your face.
2,0,0,We're lucky. This judge is rather lenient with tax evasion cases.
4,1,2,I take it you don't care about the death penalty.
3,0,0,No, taking the stand now won't really help.
3,1,0,Any chance for parole?
2,2,0,'I was only doing my job,' probably won't help much.
3,0,0,To win this thing, we'll need to show the jury the sensitive soul behind that horrifying abyss you call a face.
4,0,0,It looks pretty grim, but there might be a bright light at the end of the tunnel.
4,1,0,He’s simply here, Your Honor, for a “meet and greet” with the defendant.
3,1,0,I don't think the second amendment covers your scythe
5,0,0,Yours is the grimmest case I've ever taken.
4,0,0,Don't worry, the witness didn't see a thing.
3,0,0,I can get this dropped to half an eternity, easy.
3,0,0,Really! Can't you miss one Halloween?
2,0,0,Trust me, you cant be identified.
2,0,0,Can I just plea without the bargain?
3,2,0,Well, the fact that you're already dead might work in our favor.
4,0,0,How can you tell me to face the truth, sir?
2,2,0,We probably can't argue mistaken identity.
3,3,2,Try to avoid eye contact with the jury.
6,1,0,Your chances would be better in a suit and tie.
5,0,1,Exactly what part of "suit and tie" didn't you get?
3,0,0,And then I'll say, 'if the glove fit, you must acquit.'
3,0,0,I don't think we can rely solely on your Second Amendment rights.
3,1,0,Fortunately, this State does not carry the death penalty.
2,0,0,I don't think the Doomsday Defense is working.
3,1,0,Sorry, sir, but I don't own a blue tie.
3,1,0,Take the plea bargain. Trust me.
2,0,0,It's looking good, still no available witnesses.
8,0,1,You should come out with us. Your poker face is awesome.
4,0,0,Here's the charge against you: Humanity accuses you of refusing to R.I.P.
4,0,0,So you're saying that your defense is that you have no face?
6,0,0,I don't think the Dead Man's Statute is a defense here.
2,0,0,Good news. It's the death sentence.
4,1,2,You might get life.
2,0,0,Capital punishment infringes upon your exclusive performance rights.
2,4,1,Eternity is the best sentence we can hope for.
2,0,0,No worries. There appears to be no witnesses left.
3,0,0,You could have at least worn a tie.
3,1,0,I really don't think we should use Satan as a witness.
5,0,0,Do I look nervous now
5,0,0,I hope you are here to testify.
3,0,0,Really? You couldn't have shown up before I got indicted?
2,2,0,There's no jury alive that will convict you.
3,1,0,It's tough, defending a serial killer.
3,0,0,I think we have a ghost of chance at least !
3,0,0,They are requesting you wear a glove.
2,0,0,I can't believe the nerve of this prosecutor . . . asking for the You Penalty.
3,0,1,Please don't look the jurors in the eye.
3,0,0,Ask Johnnie Cochran if we should play the race card.
3,1,0,I'm going for taking the death penalty off the table. We've got a good chance with 'time served'.
5,0,0,I think your 'hoodie' is spooking the jury.
3,0,0,We may have found a loop hole with this whole "till death do us part" verbiage.
2,0,0,The jury's deadlocked.
2,2,0,The good news is all one hundred and two billion sentences are to run concurrently
2,0,0,We don't want the jury to see your face so keep the hoodie on
3,1,0,We're hoping for a hung jury.
3,1,0,Death is different.
2,0,0,Technically the Death penalty might just mean probation in your case.
8,2,0,your hoodie will just prejudice the jury
2,2,0,You're going to have to face facts!
2,0,0,What do you mean, you want the death penalty? ("Want" should be ital.)
3,0,0,I admire that you're now pro-life. This doesn't, however, preclude you from doing your job. Your discrimination suit just won't stick.
4,0,0,No of course I'm not going to put a Trappist monk on the stand.
3,3,1,Just answer the questions clearly and directly, and remember, no pointing.
3,0,1,I told you to wear a suit.
3,0,0,So, are you saying you're NOT a hood?
6,1,1,The plaintiff is claiming a loss in future earnings
2,0,0,They're asking for life, which I'm going to argue in your case is irrelevant.
2,0,0,It doesn't matter, they've got your fingerprints.
2,0,0,Stop intimidating the witness.
3,1,0,You want the death penalty? This is tax court.
8,0,0,Just stay quiet and the committee with talk themselves to death.
2,2,0,Remember, you don't even know what a scythe looks like.
3,1,0,They've offered you a great plea--I think you'll really reap the benefits.
3,1,0,You HAVE to face it now Sheldon! The judge is giving me that look.
2,0,0,I don't think calling Satan as a character witness was such a good idea.
2,0,0,You let your ex-wife pick out your clothes for court?
3,0,0,You'll still get visitation rights.
3,1,0,If you want people to believe you're innocent, the hoodie has to go.
2,0,0,You do understand you're looking a life sentence.
2,0,0,My best advice: deny everything.
2,2,0,I thought I told you to wear a tie.
2,2,0,I don't feel like I am representing you in the best light.
2,0,0,Do you have a tie on under your hood?
2,0,0,No, you cannot speak in your own defense.
3,0,0,Legally changing your name will not alter people's perception of you.
3,0,0,Try not to look so grim when I put you on the stand.
3,1,0,The trial ahead is looking Grim.
2,0,0,You sure don't look innocent!
2,0,0,I'm sorry, but a life sentence is non-negotiable.
3,0,0,Maybe I should have ordered my anvil to go...
2,0,0,I think, in your case, we're going to have a tough time avoiding the death penalty.
2,0,0,That hung jury joke didn't make you any more likable.
3,1,0,I need you to say you feared for your safety.
4,0,0,Prepare yourself. They have no choice but to seek the death penalty.
2,2,0,You've got a bit of an image problem.
4,1,0,You can't hang the jury yourself.
3,0,0,Offshore. Underworld. Either way, you're fine.
3,0,0,And no more leading the witness.
2,0,0,You really shouldn't threaten the witness like that.
3,0,0,Hmm, a life sentence does sound unusually harsh, let's see what we can do.
2,0,0,Frankly, we're in trouble. Everyone on the jury is alive.
5,0,1,I plea bargained from attempted murder to practicing acupuncture without a license.
3,1,0,"Yes, I got it Mr. Brown - I was acting in self defense".
3,1,0,Is there anything missing from your testimony?
2,0,0,I think they're going to seek the Death penalty.
3,1,0,Let's put you on the stand and hope for a hung jury.
3,0,0,No, "death sentence" does not mean you have to make a closing argument.
4,0,0,Faceless or not, cyber crime is still a crime. I'd suggest we plea out and save your neck.
2,3,0,Getting a venue change to the underworld might be difficult.
2,2,0,You really are the client from hell
3,1,0,Now that denial and anger are out of the way, they should be ready to bargain.
3,1,0,Any potential character witnesses?
2,2,0,No, I do not think the other lawyer's nickname is scarier than yours.
7,0,0,It looks good for an acquittal. The prosecutor can't find any witness who saw the perpetrator's face.
3,0,0,Next we have to make the jury like you".
2,0,0,She's firm on the pet groomer.
5,2,0,Thanks for not bringing your scythe.
3,1,0,Like I said, this outcome is not dead certain.
3,0,1,You could be looking at life.
2,0,0,Remember, a life sentence is a bad one, not a good one.
3,0,0,I can get you life with a chance of parole after a century. Take it or leave it.
4,1,1,They're sentencing you to life.
3,1,0,I don't think taking the fifth is going to do it.
3,1,0,How could you not know you had to pay taxes?
2,4,1,And remember, saying "the devil made me do it" probably won't sit well with the jury.
2,0,0,Look on the bright side. There are no eyewitnesses.
2,2,0,what do you mean anything but the "death" sentence ???
2,0,0,Most people swear on the Bible, but you can just use ‘The Art of the Deal’.
2,0,0,Those law school loans are killing me!
3,0,0,Defending yet another shady figure. Good thing justice is blind.
4,3,0,They're blaming you for the hung jury too.
5,2,1,When they ask what you do for a living, plead the fifth.
3,1,0,We'll use your internet entrepreneur status in the character defense.
2,0,0,Well, your acquittal was a safe bet after we reassembled the O.J. jury.
2,0,0,No, a life sentence does not mean that you're exempt.
2,2,0,It looks good. So far it's Scrooge's word against yours.
3,1,0,It's not meant as an insult. Around here death IS a penalty.
3,0,0,Don t worry.The jurors will love your soft look.
3,0,0,Can you persuade the jury with your body language?
2,0,0,"So you
2,0,0,In the eyes of the jury, removing your hoodie might make you seem a little more human.
4,0,0,Look, let's wrap this one up before we discuss volume discounts, okay?
3,0,0,What's new in the hood?
3,1,0,What do you care how I dress, I'm doing the case pro bono!
3,1,0,We could use the death penalty as a loop hole.
3,1,0,I'd can't stay and handle your case because I've got an appointment in Samarra.
2,0,0,I'm asking for Double Indemnity.
4,1,0,We're sticking with mistaken identity.
2,0,0,So - you'd be okay with a life sentence, right?
3,2,1,I'm your perfect lawyer, I've got no soul.
3,0,1,He'll commute your sentence if you give him ten years.
3,1,1,No, he didn't mean 'hung jury' literally.
3,0,0,Do you REALLY think ANYBODY can identify ME?
3,0,0,You could be looking at a life sentence...
3,1,0,Gotta say, these are the most amicable divorce proceedings I've witnessed!
2,0,0,We will show the court you could not possibly have taken it with you.
3,0,0,I think a plea deal is the best bet for you to avoid the life penalty.
3,1,0,If we lose this, the judge'll recommend the life penalty.
3,1,0,Good work. They’re looking for a scythe instead of a 38.
2,2,0,Yes, but they can't prove that it's YOUR scythe.
3,0,1,For the last time, traffic violations don't warrant the death penalty.
2,0,0,your attire was spot on for the Jury verdict
2,0,0,Yes, I'm sure. I wiped all the fingerprints off the scythe.
3,0,0,Stop moaning. It's not the end of the world.
2,0,0,I recommend we settle.
2,2,0,We need to do better than "it's my job."
2,0,0,This case is a real killer
3,1,0,Whatever you do, don't look up.
6,0,0,Looks like you're missing your tee time, the judge is keeping the death penalty on the table.
3,0,1,We'll plead insanity, because you have no head.
7,0,0,You can't take him literally, he means all dairy workers.
2,2,0,I thought we agreed on the frilly pink blouse.
2,0,0,It's called a metal detector, and you need to stop whining.
4,0,0,They've got you dead to rights.
3,0,0,Look, I know you don't usually do this, but in this case I really think you ought to accept the plea deal.
3,1,0,Don’t do anything that might turn the jury against you.
3,0,0,We've got this. I think the jury likes you.
3,0,0,So, then, I won't be given liberty.
2,0,0,Would it kill you to wear a suit and tie?
1,0,0,On the other hand, you could look at a death penalty decision as a win-win.
3,0,0,Casper, they are going to ask you one more time and you have to answer. Can you or can you not walk through walls?
3,3,2,Tell the truth, you were just doing your job.
3,1,0,They found the scythe, but there weren't any prints.
3,0,0,I think you're right to contest the parking ticket. Death would be, in most cases, a valid handicap.
3,0,0,Do you remember if they ID'ed you in the lineup?
3,1,0,Try not to show any emotion.
3,4,1,I recommend that you plead guilty and demand the death penalty.
2,0,0,With a plea deal, we should be able to avoid the You penalty.
2,0,0,This is pretty serious. It's either going to be eternity in prison or the living penalty.
4,0,0,I told you to appear grim, not like the grim reaper.
3,1,0,What's wrong with my tie?
2,2,0,You're telling me you're not afraid of the death penalty?
2,0,0,In your case, a death penalty is redundant.
2,0,0,Try not to look so grim on the stand.
2,0,0,'I guess the death sentence isn't much of an issue for you.'
2,0,0,Between you and me, we can kill this case!
2,2,0,It's not like they can give you the death penalty.
3,0,0,I hope the jury supports the death penalty.
4,0,0,Are you sure you're sure?
3,1,0,I know, I know, Death waits for no man. But we gotta break for lunch at some point.
4,0,0,As my client, I have to be honest with you - the death penalty is a distinct possibility.
3,1,0,The jury would see right through you.
2,2,0,Here comes the jury. Try not to look so grim.
2,0,0,Can you give me 5 hours? I need to hit my billable requirement this month.
3,0,0,I feel pretty good about our chances for a change of venue.
2,2,0,It may be a case of mistaken identity
3,1,0,I contacted your list of character witnesses, but they all said "Go to hell!"
2,0,0,If you testify, they can ask about your prior record -- is that ok?
2,2,0,The best we can hope for is a sentence of life.
2,2,0,If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times: you reap what you sow.
2,0,0,Big Pharma wants an injunction against you. It's good for shareholders.
3,1,0,Don't worry - the death penalty is still on the table.
3,0,0,I strongly advise that you accept the plea bargain.
3,1,0,When I took your case I said be transparent, not invisible!
2,2,0,I should warn you that everyone is trying to cheat you
3,1,1,Does this mean life!
2,0,0,I told you that trip to Cabo would come back to haunt you.
8,0,0,The judge feels very very strongly for the death sentence on this case.
2,0,0,We should avoid the life sentence for you.
3,0,1,Being sick of talking heads is not a defense.
5,3,0,No, I don't think the robe makes you look "judicial."
3,0,0,Sorry, I'm drawing a blank on your name.
2,0,0,Would you please clarify the death clause.
7,1,0,I take it the prospect of a life sentence doesn't phase you.
3,0,0,I'm certain I can get you off the death penalty.
2,0,0,Sorry about the scythe, makes the judge nervous.
5,1,0,We need to save face on this
7,1,0,We know you did it, but when is it going to stop?
3,1,0,We could argue they were at your door.
2,0,0,No you plead the *Fifth*, not the Sythe.
4,0,1,The judge doesn't see why you need to be in the witness protection program!
3,1,0,Let me tell you about my repeat customer discount.
3,0,0,Too bad you can't sit in the back.
2,0,0,Do a lot of capital cases do you?
3,0,0,You want to plead the fifth? Why?
3,1,0,I have good news. The worst punishment going to hell.
2,2,0,No, I've already explained this: "I was just following orders" isn't a legitimate defense.
2,0,0,I never thought I'd be litigating MY OWN wrongful death case!
3,2,1,Bad news. Your priors are admissible.
2,0,0,Don't take the stand in your own defense.
3,1,0,Have you signed a book deal yet?
3,0,0,I fired your wardrobe consultant.
2,2,0,Look, it was a politician. You did us all a favor.
3,0,0,So I see you pay your taxes in flesh.
3,0,0,They're giving you life.
3,1,0,How come the Judge never overrules YOUR objections?
3,1,1,We may want to reconsider our self-defense plea.
2,0,0,If you were merely a witness to his death we could make a plea bargain, but his family is sure you brought about his demise.
3,1,1,We can get you off the pestilence charge on a technicality
2,0,0,Your hoodie and your fingers still gives you away.
2,0,0,The devil you say!!
2,2,0,The situation looks grim.
5,0,0,What. What? You planted the key in Steven Avery's trailer?
2,3,1,Yes, Mr. Gupta should not have entitled his book "Cheating Death.'
3,0,0,I just don't see how we can argue it was an act of god.
3,0,0,I told you yesterday the judge does not approve of hoodies.
3,1,0,No, not going well...not well at all.
2,0,0,I'm going underground until this blow's over.
2,2,0,You realize that the death penalty isn't available in civil cases, don't you?
6,2,1,I would consider "aggravated stalking" a win.
2,0,0,The other party is taking a less literal view of the agreement's 'drop dead date.'
3,0,0,Lawyer fees are eternal
2,0,0,What''s being decided today is the extent of your life, not the jury's.
2,2,0,It would be going better if you'd stopped tweeting during the trial.
4,2,3,I think we should enter a plea of inevitable.
3,0,0,Don't worry, I'm gonna kill this guy on cross.
3,1,0,Stop looking at the jury.
2,0,0,I don’t think “It was the salmon mousse” will work as a defense.
6,0,0,What about those I should have gotten already but are still sitting in your death row cells?
3,1,0,Well, it seems you have some priors.....
3,1,0,Try not to look so smug.
4,2,0,At this time, I'd like to call the court's attention to my client's long history of charitable works in the community.
2,0,0,I'll put you on the stand to prove you're innocent if you'll change out of the clothes you wore when you committed the crime.
3,1,0,She wants to keep the house.
2,0,0,Good news....death penalty's off the table.
4,0,0,I heard the prosecution was scared to death.
5,2,0,No worries, prior bad acts are excluded
5,0,0,Best-case scenario? The death penalty.
3,1,0,The scythe didn't fit.
4,1,1,There latest deal is eternal misery in the burning fires of hell, plus life.
4,3,1,"Frankly, our chances of finding someone to testify on your behalf are pretty slim".
2,0,0,How are things in Braavos?
2,0,0,Apparently Ingmar Bergman's motion is still under court review.....
2,0,0,Stabbed by hooded farmer is no longer considered natural causes.
3,0,0,I asked you to dress solemnly, not gravely.
3,1,0,I say we go for heaven
4,1,2,We're looking at life without parole. They're looking at death without a scythe.
3,3,1,Maybe try smiling
3,0,0,Death AND taxes, death AND taxes. Why is that so hard for you to get?
2,2,0,It could be worse, it could be the death sentence...
7,0,0,I stacked the jury with Millennials.
4,0,0,Ironically, you could be sentenced to life without parole.
3,0,0,We'll appeal on the grounds that it's not only cruel and unusual punishment, but sort of ironic, too.
3,0,0,You should have told me about the scythe.
3,0,0,Let's leave jury selection to me.
2,0,0,I told you, nobody's going to take you seriously if you dress like that.
3,1,0,I think the best option is to plead guilty and ask for the death penalty.
3,1,0,At least you don't have to worry about getting the death penalty.
3,0,0,Don't worry. They can't give you the death penalty, suicide is illegal.
7,0,0,I can plea bargain for you to avoid yourself.
3,0,0,Our chances are Grim to none and Grim just left town.
1,0,0,And don't say "Read my lips!" again.
3,0,0,Just tell the judge, you take the fifth! I live in Wisconsin
2,0,0,If you cop a plea, I can probably talk the prosecutor down to the death penalty.
3,0,1,Yes, pleading guilty will get you life. Why do you ask?
2,0,0,We can't use "it's my job" as your defense.
3,0,0,I can't make any promises .. your rap sheet is the longest I've ever seen ... and jurors are turned off by the hoody.
3,1,0,It would help your case if you smiled!
4,0,0,I wouldn't recommend an ex post facto defense. You don't want to open yourself up to biblical punishment.
2,0,0,The good news is that they won't ask for life.
7,0,0,Always wear a shirt and tie in the courtroom. The hoodie could bias the jury.
4,0,0,Relax. God is taking care of this.
3,0,0,Are you sure you want to go through with this appeals process?
4,0,0,I might be able to get them to accept five to ten - if you'll throw in an extra five years for the judge...
2,0,0,I'm afraid you're going to get the Death penalty.
3,1,0,Have a snickers when court recesses...you're not you when your hungry.
4,0,0,Just once more, I'd like to see your pretty little face.
2,2,0,The best we can hope for is the death penalty.
5,0,0,A hoodie in the courtroom? Are you trying to get yourself killed?
3,1,0,So getting you a Life sentence would be a good thing.
3,2,0,I'm with the I.R.S. And you are...?
2,0,0,You said we'll fight it to the death, but I didn't realize who I'd be representing.
3,1,0,He's offering you life.....I'd take it.
4,1,2,Now remember, he was dead when you got there.
3,1,0,I'll open with Dante.
8,1,1,I'm afraid the jury doesn't like the look of you either.
4,0,0,Your appearance isn't helping.
3,0,0,OK... You'll will get 20 % every time someone says, prints, or by any way communicates the phrase, 'Death & Taxes'!
2,2,0,Couldn't you have worn something else?
3,0,0,No...you cant plead "Guilty by reason of being Death"
3,1,0,They're calling it a wrongful death.
3,1,0,Life without parole. I wish I had better news.
4,0,0,My advise is that you present "closing argument"
2,2,0,Has anyone seen your face?
3,0,1,Tomorrow I think you should go with the orange jumpsuit.
3,3,2,The caselaw is unsettled as to what a life sentence means in your situation.
2,5,0,Now try to not look so grim.
2,0,0,We're trying to avoid the death sentence.
3,1,0,I don't think we convinced then it was justifiable homicide.
2,0,0,Let's keep the death penalty on the table.
2,0,0,The Jury is awarding pain and suffering damages...for themselves.
2,0,0,Seriously? You have a life insurance policy?
3,1,0,Just don't mention what you do for a living and you'll be fine.
3,0,0,Your testimony may have grim reapercussions.
4,0,0,If all else fails we are going for a death sentence.
3,1,0,OK, I get you 30 years and you give me 30 years and we'll call it even.
4,0,0,The DA will let you plea bargain for life.
3,0,0,When this is all over could you do me a favor?
2,0,0,Sorry, this is New York. You can't demand the death penalty
3,0,0,Unfortunately the beer recipe must be licensed from the monastery for lawful reproduction
3,0,0,No need to hide your face
2,0,0,Don't worry, we'll get you an orange hood
4,0,0,'We don't normally have a reputation for ambulance chasing.'
4,0,0,That's a hung jury they are reporting. Hung. No hanged.
8,0,0,If you testify you're dead.
2,2,0,Your chances of acquittal are grim.
2,2,0,I specifically asked you not to wear a hoodie to court.
3,1,0,I'll waive my fee, if you give back my soul.
3,0,0,I don't care that NOW your best friend is Scalia, . . . it won't help us in this case.
3,0,0,What do you mean you left the scythe in the taxi?
2,0,0,Okay, how about Jazz Hands?
2,0,0,I don’t think the jury is going to buy our grim reaper defense.
3,0,0,Yes, I know, you already are dead man walking.
2,2,0,Look, I don't want you coming across like just another empty suit.
2,0,0,Well, if we lose, you should be able to slip through the bars.
3,1,0,They're calling a fingerprint expert for the scythe.
3,0,0,That's pretty grim news, that I'll reap what I sow.
2,2,0,At least you'll have your own row.
7,0,0,Plead guilty and they'll put the death penalty back on the table,
3,0,1,Forget about it. He's NOT going to give you life.
3,0,0,Plea bargain? I don't think so.
3,0,0,Three words of advice if you want to win this: Be not proud.
2,0,0,So there's no other kind of "force" you're aware of using as an alibi?
3,1,0,No, you can't be judge, jury, and executioner.
3,0,1,I don't think they'll go for involuntary manslaughter.
4,1,0,After this, I'm getting my taxes done. Wanna come?
2,2,0,I recommend avoiding eye contact with the jury.
2,0,0,Try to smile
2,0,0,Good news - They've agreed not to seek the death penalty
3,0,0,Face it, the grim truth is you're guilty.
2,2,0,I really don't think claiming self-defense is a good idea.
3,1,0,I'm glad you ditched the scythe, but couldn't you have worn a suit?
3,0,1,And try not to ask the judge where he got his robe this time.
2,0,0,It would help your case if you could ditch that hoodie.
3,0,0,Unfortunately, they can still charge with tax evasion.
3,0,0,I'm afraid that your chances of winning are grim.
3,0,0,We've got to make reaping look cool.
2,0,0,Don't volunteer anything about horses or Sleepy Hollow.
2,0,0,Well, Justice is blind, so I guess the whole invisibility thing is moot.
2,0,0,just smile and look innocent
3,0,0,This North Carolina, they will be seeking the death penalty.
2,0,0,'Seriously? That's your only suit?'
2,0,0,OK. I'll ask for the death sentence.
3,1,0,Deal. Pro bono, pro life.
2,0,0,As your attorney I'd advise you to lighten up a bit.
3,0,0,You do understand that it is against the law to ride your horse through the center of town.
3,0,0,Death, thou shalt die!
3,0,0,They're deliberating the Death sentence.
3,0,0,I'm going to do everything I can to at least get you out of having to pay taxes.
3,1,0,We're seeking the death penalty.
2,0,0,I told you to wear a suit and tie!
2,0,0,I have told you, automatism it is our only defense.
3,0,0,releasing all the Panama Papers....too much?
2,0,0,How shall I introduce you to as, to the Judge and Jury, "Meet Joe Black?" As to the charges against you: "Your Honor, may I ask the charges be dropped due to mistaken identity?
2,0,0,Turns out Double Jeopardy does not prevent them from executing you again. Bummer.
3,1,0,How did you manage not to escape detection?
3,0,0,We're doing okay, but you're gonna have to testify.
3,1,0,Good news. The jury is deadlocked.
6,0,0,They weren't able to get any prints off of the scythe.
2,0,0,Are you sure you didn't do anything to Scrooge?
3,1,0,Remember to smile and make eye contact with the jury.
2,0,0,Well, at least we don't have to worry about fingerprints.
2,0,0,Sorry, but this is the front row. Your seat's in death row.
3,0,0,Don't worry, World War II is past the statute of limitation.
3,0,0,you cant win for losin'
2,0,0,Black lives matter!!!
2,0,0,The death penalty is our best chance to get you home.
3,5,3,Just so I'm clear, your alibi is you were killing someone else at the time of the murder?
2,0,0,I'm going to recommend the death penalty
3,1,1,Don't appeal the lethal injection. You'll still be home for dinner.
3,2,0,I really thought his time was up!
3,0,0,If I were you, I would take care of Juror No. 5.
5,1,0,I asked the judge for community service.
3,0,0,I'm not putting you on the stand; they'll see right through you.
3,0,0,Just be yourself, you have nothing to hide.
3,0,0,So, you give up your Pending Hits list ... in exchange for the death penalty.
3,1,0,This is a civil case. We can only ask for monetary damages.
2,0,0,No, that penalty was not named just for you.
2,0,0,Spoiler alert! We don't have the death penalty in this state.
5,0,5,Not now--I'm in the middle of a big case.
2,3,0,I need to warn you that you could get life.
2,0,0,We need to soften your look, it's killing our case.
2,0,0,And what's the worst that could happen, death row?
2,0,0,I don't think we'll have to worry about punitive damages.
2,0,0,For the last time, I can't plea loitering up to a capital offense
3,0,0,The jury doesn't like you. You need to testify that you blacked out.
3,0,0,I don't think the Sicilian defense is going to work.
2,0,0,You're an at-will employee, so unfortunately there isn't much more I can do for you.
2,0,0,I don't think your alibi is going to hold up.
2,0,0,Just say that it's a family name.
3,0,0,I've talked them down to 100 billion consecutive life sentences. Take the deal.
4,0,0,I think it's time we introduce your sting.
2,0,0,Ironically, he's the hanging judge.
2,0,0,Things are looking grim.
3,1,0,Don't look so grim. I'm sure I can get you off with just the death penalty.
3,0,0,I realize the hoodie is part of your brand, but in this social context it's counterproductive.
4,1,2,Are you sure nobody saw your face?
6,0,0,Lets' not mention your "profession."
4,0,0,They've taken death off the table.
3,3,3,You're being sentenced to life.
2,2,0,It would be good if you smiled more.
2,2,0,When you’re called to the stand, don’t shake anyone’s hand.
3,0,0,I'm afraid the jury can see right through you.
3,3,1,you're not the judge, jury, nor executioner
3,0,0,From now on you tell me everything!
3,1,1,You of all people should have realized the certainty of taxes
2,2,0,Your looking at a life sentence.
2,2,0,So you will plead guilty as charged for doing your job?
2,3,0,Face it, the outlook's pretty grim
3,1,0,Let's opt for the death penalty. It'll give us grounds for appeal.
2,0,0,No, facing the jury is a bad idea.
2,0,0,Remember, it was self-defense.
4,0,0,Things are looking a bit grim.
2,2,0,I'm dead serious...
2,4,1,Trust me, they can't sentence you to you.
3,0,0,Short of a living will, their argument is immaterial.
3,3,2,Is there anyone who can corroborate your whereabouts who isn't dead?
4,1,3,For now, we'll leave getting the hung jury to me.
2,0,0,ff
2,0,0,Darn! That hoodie's going to influence the jury in a negative way.
3,0,0,well, at least you're not the devil.i would not like to negotiate any business deals with him.
2,4,1,I'm afraid that could be construed as witness intimidation.
2,0,0,Did you take his life?
2,0,0,You say my wife hired you?
2,3,0,Just don't point at anyone.
3,0,1,Yes Grim, you have a Constitutional Right to testify, however I still urge you not to do so.
5,0,0,You're free to go. There's no Death sentence in New York.
3,0,0,Listen Grim, Keith Richards is being granted his Restraining Order and the Stones are petitioning for immortality...
3,1,0,Have you got a nice suit? This is a tough jury.
2,0,0,Lawyer: did you kill this man Death: No Donald Trumps views on America did
3,2,2,Bad news. The scythe has your prints all over it.
3,0,0,And this train that keeps hitting us... how does it make you feel?
5,0,0,All is not lost, just try to stop thinking on the dark side.
4,1,0,They're offering a life sentence.
3,0,0,...And the last possibile outcome is that you receive the ultimate punishment--the Life Penalty.
3,1,0,You understand that life is not an option, in prison or anywhere else.
2,0,0,Will the unveiling be done at Halloween?
2,0,0,Personally, I like the hoody but it doesn't represent the 'nice guy' image we need you to have. Also, I think your name could be a problem for some of the jurors.
2,0,0,No worries, our strategy is to save face.
3,1,1,I thought we talked about this. The jury doesn't like hoodies.
2,0,0,Don't ask for the Death penalty
4,1,2,I'm dead if I lose this, right?
2,2,0,The court's landmark decision in United States v. Death led to the break-up of the world's largest monopoly.
5,0,0,They've reduced the charges to only 45 billion counts of first-degree murder.
2,0,0,win or lose , it's how you wore your hat
2,2,0,No, the death penalty would be redundant.
3,1,0,To this jury, you're not death incarnate, you're just a white guy with a hoodie - you'll be fine.
2,0,0,You are making the jury uneasy!
2,0,0,Not all is good in the hood.
2,0,0,There is no such thing as a writ of habeas corpse
2,0,0,I'm not the one on trial here.
2,0,0,You're lucky we're in California.
3,1,0,I am worried about the way you are dressed before a conservative judge. He normally rules against men wearing nail polish.
3,0,0,Listen Pal, I'm telling you the Ghost of Christmas Past would work better for this case.
3,3,0,Not bringing the scythe into court was a good call.
3,0,1,Your best option is to take the death penalty.
2,0,0,This isn't about saving face.
4,0,1,Worse case scenario, they give you life.
3,0,0,I recommend not mentioning your work the elderly.
6,0,0,Yeah, but after the "Raise your right hand" part, I thought you really loosened up.
2,0,0,We'll convince the jury you were a victim of mistaken identity.
2,0,0,As your legal counsel, I suggest you stop saying 'The GR is in the House'.
2,0,0,Mr. Reaper, I don't think that shouting 'I'm coming for you next!" is the best way to deal with these serious allegations.
2,0,0,We don't have a ghost of a chance the evidence, is over whelming, but I will try my best.
5,1,0,Just be yourself.
3,0,0,Hood or handles, your choice.
2,3,0,I don't think we're going to get much traction arguing that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.
3,0,0,No, sorry. The death penalty does not mean you get to choose.
3,1,0,But it just isn't happening at the other campaign rallies.
2,0,0,You forgot your tie again.
3,0,0,Sorry, it looks like you're getting the death penalty again.
3,0,0,If you are lucky the judge might make you do some community service.
3,1,0,Normally, I'd counsel you to take the life sentence offered. But it does not become you.
3,1,0,I'm thinking the death penalty would be win-win.
2,0,0,Just look at the bright side. If you get a life sentence you can go to the beach.
3,1,0,You would be too grim on the stand.
2,0,0,It's looking grim... I can't get you off the hook
2,2,0,Relax. This isn't my first wrongful death case.
2,1,0,The courtroom artist's going to struggle with you.
5,3,10,Just don't laugh when they talk about the death penalty.
2,1,0,If we lose it will be deja vu.
2,0,0,The word is he's a hanging judge.
3,1,0,I say its worth the risk. If the Scythe is too short, they can't possibly convict you.
3,0,0,Nice try, but a writ of habeas corpse won't cut it.
3,1,0,It's a hung jury...literally.
3,0,0,I don't think symphony is a good strategy here. Try looking less grim. Go get an iced tea. :::::::::::::::::::,,,
3,0,1,When I put you on the stand, don't look so grim.
3,2,1,We're screwed - this judge is pro-life.
3,0,0,Yes, our brief was brief. But funny? No.
2,0,0,You can't object every time I say 'habeas corpus.'
2,2,0,Just try to sound sympathetic
4,0,0,I don't like to reschedule on my plastic surgeon. It's rude.
2,0,0,I want your answers upbeat and lively.
2,2,0,I hope the prosecution doesn't try to show that there is a pattern here.
3,0,0,Sorry. I couldn't find any character witnesses.
3,0,0,I'm not sure 'temporary invisibility' is a valid plea.
3,1,0,I can't promise that you won't get life
2,3,0,Well, in your case, it is kind of a win-win.
3,1,0,Don't say anything about your plans for tonight.
2,0,0,What evidence, Mr. Death? Just a big sharp sickle found near the body!
3,1,0,I can't believe the outcome of this case is a life or death matter for you.
2,2,0,You don't have to worry about the death sentence.
2,0,0,You've got to stop pointing at the jurors
3,1,0,D.A.claims your alibi "sounds hollow" !
2,2,0,Did they see your face?
6,0,0,Tell me was it the Salmon Paté at lunch?
2,0,0,If you plead guilty, they will take the death penalty off the table.
4,1,2,I don't say this lightly, Greg. You killed it up there on on the witness stand.
3,1,0,They think that you should have had the foresight to not look in the rear view mirror.
2,3,0,I think we should go with the insanity plea.
2,3,0,Spin it how you like, no one believes you're the life and soul of any party
3,1,0,It's a you penalty case.
3,0,0,Smile a lot.
3,0,0,Considering you are being accused of killing everyone who ever existed, yes, I'm a little concerned.
2,2,0,Should I ask for the death penalty?
2,2,0,To pick a jury of your peers, we need bottom feeders: foreclosure buyers, eviction specialists and conservative think tank linguistics artists who praise the need "tax relief."
3,0,0,You're absolutely certain you want a tax attorney?
3,0,0,Let me live and this hour is half price.
4,1,2,The worst you could get is Life
3,1,0,The ruling is final; you will be replaced by 2017
8,0,0,The scythe may send the wrong message.
2,2,0,No, I'm afraid we can't use Faust as a character witness.
3,2,1,I have a feeling the sentencing should be right up your alley.
2,0,0,This will most likely be my last death penalty case.
2,0,0,I woke up with this feeling that things are looking up for me today.
7,0,0,So you don't think it's at least a little ironic that you're here for tax evasion?
3,1,0,My objection was overruled. Your turn.
2,0,0,As your lawyer, I suggest you not testify in this wrongful death suit.
2,3,0,You reap what you reap.
6,0,0,I think I can get an acquittal if we can come up with a rhyme for "scythe."
5,1,0,I think there's a hole in our case.
4,0,0,Let me explain again. Nothing in Law is ever final.
3,1,0,I recommend you plead the fifth.
2,2,0,I can get you a deal if you can live with it.
3,1,0,Well, he is known as "The Hanging Judge".
3,0,0,They couldn't see your face in that hoodie.
3,1,1,In your case, the death penalty is a winning situation.
3,1,0,Did my mother -in -law send you
3,0,0,Don't worry, the jury likes you!
3,0,0,You're not helping your case by laughing at the judge when he brings up the death penalty.
6,0,0,It's all circumstantial. They can't PROVE it was your scythe.
3,0,0,You're only death's maître d'? Clever, but I don't think the jury will see it that way.
3,0,0,How could you even tell that the business suit you were supposed to wear to court today was one size too small?
3,1,0,Though in your case, 'life' might be a good thing.
3,1,1,I don't think you need to worry about the death penalty.
2,0,0,I told you orange clashes with my skin tone!
4,0,0,If the judge grants class action you're done for.
3,1,0,I know you're facing the death penalty, but in your case I think we can risk a jury trial.
4,0,0,But you're not qualified to BE President.
2,0,0,Legally, our insanity defense makes sense. Existentially, we're opening up a can of worms.
4,0,0,I still do not understand why this has become a capital case.
3,0,0,I'll need you to put on a good face in front of the jury.
2,0,0,I never do this, but I'm suggesting you go for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Most of my clients think of it as a penalty.
3,0,0,I just worry that the hoodie makes you look a little suspicious.
3,1,0,You know, this whole case hinges on the jury being able to see what you're really made of.
2,0,0,Remember--try not to look so grim.
3,3,1,I'm worried the cloak makes you look unsympathetic.
4,0,0,You are fortunate that 140 billion are getting thrown out due to the statute of limitations.
2,0,0,I think if we plead now, we can avoid the you penalty.
2,0,0,Any words of optimism
2,3,0,They want to sentence you to life.
3,1,0,Some bad news, your alibi is alive.
4,1,2,Death be not proud--so it's okay to take the fifth
2,0,0,The jury doesn't seem to like you.
2,2,0,"I'm the only judge around here," said Death to his lawyer.
3,1,0,So, am I defending you as the Grim Reaper or the Grim Rapper?
2,1,0,They're not buying that it was an accident.
3,0,0,Can I, Death, really be sentenced to...Death?
2,0,0,Good news. It's a hung jury.
9,0,0,I'm afraid the sentence is death.
3,0,0,I'm afraid the best we can hope for is a hung jury.
3,1,0,I think you and I have a different definition of hung jury
3,0,0,If you don't lose the hood, people will take grim part seriously.
3,0,0,Stop looking at the jury. You're creeping them out.
2,2,0,Face it, you're dead.
3,1,0,Yes, I'm certain that these are my taxes...why?
3,1,0,How do we plead if everything you say is a lie?
3,0,0,I know what you think, but I'm taking the plea.
5,0,1,Could you LOOK any more guilty?
2,1,0,Look right at number four when you say 'death penalty' and he'll come around.
4,0,0,Whew...I can't wait for this week to be over...
3,0,0,Maybe it was a better idea to pick up dry cleaning first.
2,3,0,I'll let you do the closing argument.
3,0,1,Ironically, they want to give you life.
2,2,0,Didn't I specifically tell you to wear dress attire and definitely no hoodies.
2,2,0,I think 'It's my job' won't work as a line of defense here.
5,1,0,Once again, let me start by asking you to *not* visit the judge.
3,1,0,"Yes ironically a "hung jury " would be in our favor.
2,3,0,Sorry, but this was a tough case.
2,0,0,Your witness failed to show up again, Death.
4,1,1,If I’m going to get you off, you have to lose the hoodie.
2,2,0,When you glance at the jurors you need to look less grim.
2,4,0,It won't be easy finding a jury of your peers.
10,0,0,I told you to wear a suit and tie when we're in trial, remember?
5,0,0,Are you sure you aren't hiding anything?
3,1,1,Try not to be too dark.
3,0,0,I'd say we have a pretty cut-and-dry case of profiling here.
2,0,0,Our defense is that you were hoodwinked
3,0,0,Justice may be blind but the jury can see you.
2,0,0,Yes, as the plaintiff in an identity theft case, you will have to testify.
3,0,0,I told you to wear a tie and jacket.
3,2,1,I thought we agreed on business casual.
6,0,0,I agree, but they're not going to compromise despite how surreal it'll be.
2,0,0,What are your thoughts on the death penalty?
2,2,0,I've been hoodwinked!
3,1,1,No, this would NOT be an appropriate time to tell the judge his sentence.
3,0,0,I need your optimism here.
2,0,0,Try and put on a good face regardless of the ruling.
2,0,0,Let me get this straight... You're willing to swear, under oath, that you were framed by a guy named Bergman?
4,1,0,Just keep your poker face.
8,2,0,Isn't the death penalty technically suicide?
3,0,0,Cheer up, your chances are pretty grim.
4,0,0,If you get life, you can walk.
4,2,3,I don't think you're getting custody.
6,1,0,The hoodie is killing us!
2,0,0,We just keep hammering home that it would be cruel and unusual to sentence you to life.
3,1,0,It might work to your benefit if we say you own a startup company.
4,2,0,Yes, I definitely recommend taking the 5th!
7,0,0,No more hand motions across your throat, it's hurting our case.
2,0,0,You can't go along passing yourself off as Mark Zuckerberg without repercussions.
4,1,0,We're not going with- "If you're the Angel of Death, it's what you do" defense!
3,0,0,Sorry. The judge said 'No' to chess.
3,0,0,I told you, we're not in France. Besides, they don't do that anymore.
3,0,0,Don't worry, I worked for Robert Shapiro in the 90s.
3,1,0,They call me the Grim Briefer.
3,1,0,You don't have much color and a neck tie would have been nice
3,1,0,Now they've got some character witness who says you hustled him at chess.
3,0,0,For jury selection, we're going to want to find people who are more afraid of public speaking than they are of you.
5,0,0,Let's face it....your going down.
2,2,0,In the ultimate irony, they're going to sentence you to life.
2,0,0,If the jury comes back with a guilty verdict you'll be looking at 25 to life.
3,1,0,He wants a stay of execution.
3,5,3,Finding a jury of your peers was hell.
6,0,0,Your complexion is sallow. Get more fresh air and exercise.
3,1,0,Don't worry, the worst you can get is death.
6,0,1,Stick to the story. You are personally opposed to the death penalty.
3,0,0,I think the jury bought our guilt by "professional association" argument.
3,0,1,You're making jury selection rather difficult.
2,0,0,Trust me. Direct eye contact with the jury can work in our favor.
3,0,0,You want to offer the Judge 10 MORE years?
2,0,0,Of course we will appeal if your given a "life" sentence.
2,0,0,Look, I've done all I can, but the jury needs to hear you testify.
3,1,0,We're going to plead insanity.
3,0,0,No, I don't think it's a good idea for you to take the stand."
3,0,0,It's not great, Mr. Reaper, but at least we got the "taxes" part tossed.
2,2,0,You really gotta stop making eye contact with the jury.
3,1,0,I don't think I can sell the jury on, "Come on baby(Don't fear the reaper.)"
2,0,0,They want to know who issued your scythe license.
2,0,0,God made me do it - a bit hokey but does rhyme with acquit.
2,0,0,I'd advise you to lose the hoodie before the jury is seated.
2,2,0,Guess who's turning state's evidence against you--your good buddy, Taxes.
3,0,0,Mr. President Elect, The 2014 IRS audit has just started.
3,0,0,You understand that I'll get 50 percent and that you can't take your share with you.
2,0,0,We'll try to get you the death sentence, anything to avoid life.
2,0,0,At least the judge can't give you the death sentence.
3,0,0,This defamation suit against Deep Purple was a mistake.
3,0,0,Waaaait a second...have you been saying REAP all this time??!
4,1,0,Maybe I should not have hired a lawyer who was in the witness-protection program.
3,0,0,I don't think you have a ghost of a chance.
4,0,0,Dead or not, Issa will still go after you.
2,2,0,One thing is certain: you're going to have to pay your taxes, Death.
3,1,1,I'm with the NRA. We're taking your case pro bono.
2,0,0,Please tell me you're here to be my pro bono client.
3,1,0,Sorry. No body, no habeus corpus.
3,1,0,Soon you will be free to show your face.
3,1,0,I thought we agreed on a navy suit.
2,0,0,I'm not going to lie to you, your future looks Grim
3,1,0,Now try to look cheerful.
6,0,0,Let's call it a scythe.
3,0,0,I know the prints don't match.
4,2,0,The way I see it, your a deadman.
2,0,0,There's no easy way to say this but you've got terrible breath.
3,0,0,Life in prison or death penalty, does it really matter?
3,2,0,o.k. - just try to look innocent like we practiced.
2,0,0,Worst case? Life.
3,0,0,Only you would wear a hoodie into a courtroom.
4,0,0,Listen, the jury will side with the police if you insist on the hoodie.
3,1,0,Do not pull out the scythe when you're being cross-examined.
2,2,0,It's important to make eye contact with the jury.
2,2,0,‘No Lives Matter’ won’t hold up in court.
5,0,0,Since you're being charged with a capital offense I think I can get you released on your own recognizance.
3,1,0,Bad news, the prosecution is asking for a life sentence.
3,1,0,Remember, the scythe was next to the body when you arrived.
3,1,1,If you plead guilty, I think we can get you life.
2,0,0,How would you feel about a plea bargain- Life sentence without parole?
2,0,0,No, you just have to wait until the next recess like everyone else.
3,0,0,I know that you have your rights, but let me do the talking.
2,0,0,Chill out. He wrote a book and three short stories.
2,4,0,No, we can not ask for the death penalty, you were arrested for trespassing.
4,0,0,I'd say not to worry, because this is Texas and they need you, but on the other hand, this IS Texas.
3,0,0,I don't know why you chose me, I'm a tax attorney.
3,1,0,I say, cop a plea and go for Eternity with chance of parole.
4,0,0,It doesn't look good, I'm going to need payment up front.
2,0,0,Ummm…that's not exactly what "habeas corpus" means here.
3,1,0,You're missing all of your 1099-DIE forms.
2,0,0,You can't just hang the jury.
5,0,0,Yes, I realize that hoodies are really in style now so it could have been someone else.
3,0,0,This being a capital case, there may be a conflict of interest here.
3,0,0,So--you can really make these parking tickets go away?
3,0,0,The hoodie's not working for us.
3,0,0,You have to stop killing the testifiers.
5,0,0,I'm guessing this has something to do with Operation Car Wash!
5,0,0,So I'm guessing you're not the guy from the Innocence Project?
3,0,0,What do you mean you don't care that this is a death penalty case?
2,0,0,The truth is, all nine of them are trying to cheat you.
3,0,0,They found you guilty on all 3 billion counts.
3,1,0,Ok, my case is that unless they can come up with the scythe, there's reasonable doubt
4,0,0,So , after the Archbishop who did you see?
3,0,0,Plead insanity and say you lost your head.
2,0,0,Best case scenario: we get life....
3,1,0,I thought we agreed that you were going to wear a suit today.
2,0,0,Remember, it's not just you. It's taxes.
3,2,2,I think you're misunderstanding habeas corpus.
2,0,0,We think Grim is prejudicial so we're going with Natural Reaper.
3,0,0,Let's take the plea deal
3,0,0,Listen, everyone's a little thrown off here. The prosecution is unsure whether to try you as a serial killer, the judge can't figure out whether the death penalty even applies and my 80 year old mother who like to watch me work is plain scared.
8,0,0,when are you allowing strangers to this contest ? you haven't change the countries authorized
2,0,0,.....remember now, do not bring up your involvement with Death.
3,0,0,You're looking at life, max. Assisted suicide is illegal in this state.
3,0,0,Don't worry. They can't find you on Facebook.
6,1,0,I'm gonna go ahead and suggest that you not testify.
2,2,0,Would it have killed you to wear a tie?
2,0,0,Sorry, but you don't stand a ghost of a chance with this jury.
2,0,0,As for my expenses ... I can make a deal with you.
2,2,0,I don't care who you are. I still have to execute your case.
3,1,0,He said it's looking pretty grim for you.
4,0,0,I thought you said you'd only charge an arm and a leg!
2,0,0,I thought you understood me when I told you not to wear your hoodie to trial.
5,0,0,What did you say your rate was again?
2,0,0,I'm not sure if our "Grim Reaper" defense will hold up in this murder case, but, we'll give it a shot!
2,0,0,The jury is not likely to award you his soul in punitive damages.
3,2,1,The death penalty would be too ironic.
3,0,1,Life without parole is your best bet
2,0,0,The airhead defense is better than the Fifth.
2,0,0,I'm going to assume you're familiar with the death penalty.
2,2,0,Take the plea and we'll have you out in half an eternity.
3,1,1,Relax. You're not going to get life.
3,1,0,Can you arrange for a hung jury?
3,1,0,Your check bounced
4,1,3,I'm sorry, but "its my thing" is not a defense.
2,0,0,Don't worry. No one saw your face.
2,0,0,Why do the court think I'm responsible for Wall Street shorts?
4,1,1,I didn't realize Hell had a law school.
2,0,0,Look Mr. Death I accepted parsnips for your dui but this is a pandemic I'm going to need cash.
2,0,0,We need to do this right or you'll get life!
3,1,0,It looks like a hung jury.
2,0,0,I'm sorry, I've already taken the Fifth Century !
3,0,0,I will check their I.D. next time.
3,1,0,Take it easy. We have a good I.D. defense.
3,0,0,At least the death sentence is off the table.
5,1,0,Well, the IRS is certain you did not pay these taxes.
2,0,0,Remember, your scythe is cutting wheat.
2,2,0,We're changing your name.
3,3,2,That isn't what I meant by 'business attire.'
2,0,1,I think we can get it reduced to manslaughter.
2,0,0,I think we're gonna shoot for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Don't worry...the death penalty is off the table.
4,0,2,I don't think you can invoke the 5th Parallel.
2,0,0,You don't give away a damn thing, do you?
3,0,0,I don't know who to bill !
4,1,0,Perfect! And I'll handle the tax issues.
4,0,0,Would you like to flip a coin to decide your fate, Jerry?
3,0,0,And what happens if you do get the death penalty?
3,2,0,If we're lucky...they"ll offer a death sentence
2,0,0,No, what I asked was, Did you, Reaper?; not Did you rape her?
3,1,0,We might be over playing the "pain and suffering" bit ...
3,0,0,Just remember- You saw nothing, you heard nothing.
6,0,2,I'm going for the death sentence. It's your only way out.
3,1,0,I don't think 'it's inevitable' is a winning defense.
3,1,0,Good news. One of the jurors is an undertaker.
3,0,0,You're making a specter of yourself.
2,3,0,The evidence is pretty damning.
3,1,0,Before I start I have one last question. What happens to me if I lose?
4,2,3,Try not to look proud.
2,0,0,You cannot expect to escape The Chair by using the Unabomber Defense!
3,1,0,It's working. You're scaring the jury.
5,1,0,So much for that Witness Protection Program, huh?
2,3,0,We might have a problem getting the death penalty off the table.
2,2,0,I told you to ditch the hoodie.
3,0,0,Let's get you clean shaven.
2,2,0,This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I asked you to dress modestly for court today.
4,1,0,Being under Texas law, you can look forward to...well...yourself.
3,1,0,Will you be picking the jury or shall I?
6,0,0,Well 'Death', if that is your real name, 'I am a lawyer.' It's you who should be worried.
2,0,0,Face facts, man, if you show your face, you'll be faced with a felony.
3,0,0,I don't think the Twinkie Defense is going to work.
2,0,0,That selfie you took on the river Styx really killed your alibi.
3,0,0,Listen Mr. Reaper. I think it's best that we continue to refer to you by your middle name.
3,0,1,When the judge says "death", that means a penalty, not an occupation.
2,0,0,One more positive ID and we're in big trouble.
2,0,0,Let's face it - you haven't got a leg to stand on.
3,0,0,Next time if you want to skip the trial and get straight to the juicy bits go over to Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
2,0,0,What do you mean, your mind has gone blank?
4,0,0,It all comes down to facial recognition.
2,0,0,Fortunately, a life sentence is out of the question.
5,2,6,I'm afraid they'll give you life.
5,0,0,So...the proverbial empty suit is now the empty hoodie?
3,3,2,I have to say things look pretty grim.
3,1,0,I think you should be quiet and take the deal, if convicted you will get natural life plus ten years, that could be an eternity in your case!!
3,0,0,hey bro
2,0,0,You keep telling me I'm going to lose but I have confidence.
5,2,0,The death penalty is the least of your worries.
4,0,0,Yes, I'd bone D.A. Erin Reagan, too. Wait ... what do you mean by that?
3,1,0,I think you should have gone with a navy blazer.
3,1,1,Just remember, if the sentence is life, we can always appeal.
3,1,0,You should probably consider actually letting this jury live.
5,1,0,You're telling me this now?
3,0,1,With any luck, the prosecutor will go for the Death penalty.
2,0,0,When I said dress up for court, I didn't mean as the Grim Reaper.
2,2,0,At least they can't sentence you to death.
3,1,0,You know, a suit and tie would have made a better impression.
3,0,0,Permit me to play Devil's advocate.
3,0,1,I'm sorry to say this case is taking a grave turn.
3,2,2,Claim you were unfairly profiled.
4,0,0,1. Maybe second chair on a tax evasion case is just too symbolically challenging for this jury? 2. "Supreme" appointment or not, that still doesn't explain how you got this nomination hearing before the election?
3,0,0,You don't have to tell them where your sting is.
3,0,1,Self defense? Each time?
2,0,0,How about this? I get you off and you let me live until Apple's no more.
4,0,0,Stop telling the Judge to refer to it as "The Me Penalty"
2,2,0,Just plead 'Guilty'. It's only the death penalty...
4,0,1,You promised the next time we're called in front of the Senate, I could wear it!
2,0,0,Getting life is not something to be happy about.
3,3,1,Sorry, it looks like they're not going to exclude your priors.
3,0,0,Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not going to put you on the stand.
2,0,0,I think our best move here may be to claim self-defense.
3,0,1,Look, just try to appear upbeat. This jury looks sympathetic.
3,0,0,What are you in the dark about? They said you used deadly force!
3,1,0,I'm basing your defense on no proof of intent.
2,0,0,Good news; you're getting death.
2,0,0,You know you are not doing yourself any favor by wearing a hoodie to court.
2,2,0,Their case is mostly circumstantial.
2,0,0,You're giving me a devil of a time.
3,0,1,Relax..you're in good hands. I got Taxes off on a technicality last week.
3,0,0,If the editor is found guilty for not responding to submissions of cartoons in a timely manner, you can have him.
3,1,0,You Honor, I've told him a hundred times that this is pro bono, but he keeps insisting that someone is going to pay for all this.
2,0,0,We'll petition for a change of venue to 13th century Florence.
2,0,0,We're going to argue for diminished responsibility, Mr. Reaper, on the grounds that your actions were controlled by another agent, Fate.
3,1,0,I think we're in trouble. They're going to call Taxes to the stand.
3,0,1,We are going to ask for the death penalty and have you remanded into your own custody.
2,0,0,Technically, any sentence is a Death penalty.
3,0,0,Your creative interpretation of the RICO Act could be much more efficient.
2,0,0,I'm sorry, but "its my thing" is a defense.
3,0,0,you gotta stop with the pop-in
3,2,1,I'm sorry, they will not allow you to execute yourself.
3,0,0,I'm gonna put you on the stand. Can you smile?
3,1,0,You got this. They're all afraid of you. Everybody in the room is afraid of you.
5,0,0,Deal? If we pass this, can I live to see it happen?
2,0,0,Another drone design flaw in the making
3,1,0,The sentence might be life.
4,0,2,If you don't take the plea deal, the prosecutor's going to seek the life penalty.
3,1,0,Take the deal. It's only two days in heaven.
3,2,1,I'll tell the judge you were only doing your job
3,0,0,Ironically they're seeking the death penalty.
2,2,0,They are going to ask for the you penalty
5,0,0,I'm the ambulance chaser
3,0,0,We just handle your trusts and estates.
5,3,1,Stop worrying. The worst you can get is 'life'.
3,1,0,His early death was a simple case of mistaken identity. Occupational hazard, right?
3,1,0,I thought we said less ghastly.
3,0,0,I keep explaining to you that we can't ask for the death penalty in a civil case.
3,0,0,If "The Devil and Daniel Webster " is any precedent, I have you beat.
2,0,0,They aren't too lenient with habitual offenders...
3,1,1,The prosecution will try to get you to grin. Don't.
2,0,0,That outfit makes you look guilty
4,1,0,Take care of jurors 3, 5, and 8 and we're home free.
2,0,0,The person that you visited died? That was your alibi!
2,0,0,But they're just about to announce the verdict...
2,0,0,In your case, a hung jury is likely
8,3,0,Yes, the judge and jury are aware that your arresting officers and the district attorney all passed away this week.
4,1,0,Go with me here. What's the worst that can happen?
3,2,1,Congratulations, it's a hung jury.
3,0,0,They got you on intent.
8,0,0,What do you mean the tie makes me look guilty?
2,0,0,The judge is hoping you will take the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,No magistrate in the country will convict you—you were just supervising.
3,1,0,Don't worry. If they don't dismiss the class-action after these hearings, we're simply going to ask for some class members to appear in person.
3,0,0,Is this a higher or a lower court?
3,0,0,They've got you at the scene. They've got you on motive. Let's leave the reaper home again tomorrow, OK?
5,0,0,Death and Tax Evasion.
3,0,0,Make sure you put that bag of Skittles away in your pocket before you leave this courtroom.
3,0,0,All we have to do is raise reasonable doubt.
2,0,0,Sorry to disappoint. This is not a capital punishment state
3,1,0,If we lose this case, can you at least wait 20 years before you come for me?
3,1,1,The good news is they're requesting the death penalty.
3,0,1,Would you prefer a life sentence or a death sentence?
3,0,0,'He said that if you harvest one more juror, he's going to hold you in contempt."
2,0,0,Great idea! Your defense is really going to kill them.
2,0,0,We couldn't find any character witnesses.
3,0,0,The "alleged" destroyer of worlds, OK?
2,0,0,They’re just prejudiced. They think that every faceless man in a cloak is guilty of soul theft.
3,1,0,Please don't take this the wrong way, but I feel that your representation in my death penalty case is not in my best interest. I am going to ask for a new lawyer.
3,0,0,Anything less than the death penalty and we'll appeal.
3,1,0,This is a murder case. You need to show more emotion.
2,0,0,I'm sorry to have to be the one to break it to you, but this state no longer has the death penalty.
9,0,0,Come on are you going to follow me everywhere. O.k. I've learned my lesson, texting and driving are bad.
3,0,1,Remember, let me do all of the talking
3,0,0,Like I always advise TNY Ghost Writers,.......Take the Fifth!
3,0,0,Try to be a little more approachable in front of the jury.
4,0,0,I'm worried about jurors number 5, 7 and 8. They look quite ill, wouldn't you agree?
3,1,0,All things considered, LIFE without parole is pretty generous.
3,1,0,Relax. No jury would dare find you guilty.
2,1,0,I should tell you, the judge is not happy about those 100 billion dead bodies.
2,0,0,Next time you Object, try saying it in your spooky voice.
2,0,0,Naturally, it would be awkward if they sentence you to death.
6,0,0,"They're offering 25 to life." Submitted by Douglas Monaghan, Floral Park, NY
3,0,0,We’re going to argue that all your actions were motivated by a sincerely held religious belief.
2,0,0,Here's the deal: The DA will drop the terrorism charge... but they're not budging on Genocide 1
3,2,1,Habeas Corpus? Seriously?!?
4,0,0,What's your definition of habeas corpus?
3,1,0,Because you're a family friend I'll do it pro bono
3,0,0,I'm saving you talents for the penalty phase.
2,2,0,I told you there would be Grim Reapercussions!
2,0,0,"W'll plead justifiable homicide.":
4,2,0,No, you're doing the closing.
2,0,0,I said dress trim, not grim.
3,0,0,Scythe doesn't matter.
3,0,1,Maybe you could kill less people.
3,0,0,I'm going to petition for more jury challenges.
4,0,0,There is no option to plead "repent! The end is nigh!"
3,0,0,If we don't like how it's going, let's strike the jury.
2,0,0,I assume the death penalty is not an issue.
2,0,0,I would advise you to just pay the fine and quit using your current exfoliant!
2,0,0,Your scythe? I don't think arguing the second amendment will work.
3,1,0,Remember - during cross-examination, stay grim.
2,2,0,You of all people should know a continuance is out of the question.
7,0,0,Are you ready to face the music?
3,2,0,Would it kill you to wear a suit?
6,1,0,He said, 'Will the accused please face the court.'"
3,1,0,We probably should have plead out.
2,0,0,no, you may not tell the Judge that his time has come.
3,0,1,And remember, only answer the question asked.
3,0,0,You want my advice? Smile a little, look alive, try and show some remorse--otherwise you're lookin' at Death!
3,1,2,Try to look less guilty.
3,0,0,I'll waive all legal fees if you agree not to see me again for a long, long time.
2,0,0,After careful consideration, I agree that a zero percent contingency fee is an excellent idea.
8,1,0,The burden is on the prosecution to produce a body.
7,3,1,Hey man, If you had just paid your taxes, we wouldn't be here.....
2,0,0,If asked, say docent. It's less threatening.
2,0,0,Plead the insanity defense: it's the best way to beat the serial unauthorized abduction charge.
3,0,0,No, Shkreli does not have a copyright on that sentiment, but I must advise you not to tweet it during the hearing.
5,0,0,actually, I was thinking we should wait until I have presented my final argument.
3,1,0,Request a death sentence?Clever.
3,1,0,You're in luck, they're seeking the death penalty.
10,1,1,Let's challenge Juror number four. Her grandma died recently.
2,0,0,it would help your case if you appeared remorseful
2,0,0,Life imprisonment.
4,0,0,No, murder for hire starts next week. This one is conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
2,0,0,Nice Tie
2,0,0,Congratulations, they've denied his writ of Habeas Corpus.
4,1,2,I think our best hope at this point is a hung jury.
7,1,0,No, look, we went over this already -- you *don’t* want a hung jury.
11,1,0,So this is what you are going with,what are you? who are you?
2,0,0,I'll try to get you life.
3,0,0,I'm confident. Everyone on the jury is over 80
5,0,0,Yeah, I think it's a possibility that they may consider the death penalty.
3,1,0,I recommend you take the plea bargain
2,2,0,I'm not sure the death and taxes argument constitutes reasonable doubt.
2,2,0,Judge Harry ordered you to leave your scythe outside the courtroom?
2,2,0,We'll have a better chance if you lose the hoodie.
11,0,0,Don't keep looking at the jurors. It's not helping your case.
3,0,1,Perhaps I should deliver the closing argument instead.
4,1,2,I'm sorry, but it looks like you'll be sentenced to Life.
3,0,0,Because there are no witnesses, the evidence against you is strictly circumstantial.
4,1,2,Try to be less grim.
3,0,0,We'll argue that trying this case as a capital offense is redundant.
3,1,0,Remember to let the jurors see your loveable side.
2,0,0,Technically, that would be jury tampering.
3,1,0,What game of chess?
2,0,0,– hey Death, think we gonna win – why? – they can't find your fingerprints
3,1,0,"Profiling" will not be an adequate defense in this case.
2,0,0,Joint custody is acceptable but I will not budge on the gardening tools.
3,0,0,Well, really, it's not cruel OR unusual for you, is it?
2,2,0,Who's calling who an empty suit?
3,3,1,I think the hoodie might give the jury the wrong impression.
2,0,0,I still need some documents proving that it is indeed your playground.
4,0,0,I rest my case?
3,0,0,I know we're not supposed to get personal here, but my wife would like to know how her mother is doing.
1,0,0,By the way, where do I send your bill?
3,1,0,How do you want to plead?
4,0,0,face it, without your testimony, we're going to lose this case.
3,0,0,You really need to start giving me a heads up about that kind of stuff.
2,0,0,They think you are a serial killer.
3,1,0,Worst case scenario, you get a life sentence.
5,1,0,Death, be not proud-especially when you take the stand...
6,1,0,No, it is not a sentence that is written by you.
2,0,0,"Well...yes, the death penalty is on the table, but as your lawyer, I'd advise against that!
3,0,0,Thanks for agreeing to leave the scythe outside the courtroom.
3,0,0,Relax. The onus is on the Crown to prove that scythe was intended for anything but trimming the lawn....
3,0,0,It's the third time that you did this when I asked about my bill.
3,0,0,''You were identified by the security camera's face recognition.''
2,0,0,We're going to have to call your mother.
4,1,0,I was thinking maybe life without parole
2,0,0,This is where I usually say 'keep a stiff upper lip'.
4,0,0,This is no time to try and save face.
2,0,0,The courtroom is all about theatre. So, break a leg." "If the jury looks at you, you're a free spirit." "It's hard to find a jury of your peers." "So I'm off the hook, right? A long and healthy life?
3,0,0,Just so we are clear, you want me to argue in favor of the death penalty. Is that correct?
3,0,0,I'll take the fifth on that and anyone who disagrees.
3,0,0,I don't think they'll believe you're not taking the stand because you have a migraine.
3,1,0,You won't have a chance if you sit thru the trial just looking so guilty.
2,2,0,Let's face it... Anything you get is a death penalty.
2,0,0,Let's face it: your only hope is a plea for manslaughter.
4,0,0,That's not what I meant when I said, "wear something that makes you look serious".
2,5,1,I should be able to get you off with a death sentence.
3,0,0,I think I can have the charges dismissed on mistaken identity.
2,0,0,You've been through how many attorneys??
2,0,0,"Are you here for the vacancy"?
3,0,0,I think I can get the charge reduced to involuntary manslaughter.
2,0,0,Defending taxes would be easier than this.
4,4,8,Stop it. They'll just keep bringing in a new judge.
2,0,0,The outfit's not helping, OJ
2,0,0,'This might be tricky, they have you at the scene'
8,0,0,It is time for a new defense strategy. I think you are sending the jury the wrong message.
3,1,1,Look, I'll try for appeal, but they've got you on 55 million murder charges for last year alone.
3,1,0,Obviously,the death penalty is off the table.
3,0,0,I'm grateful for the option, but the Trump court has yet to determine the specifics of "fate worse than death."
3,0,0,Yes, yes, I adore Dickens too, but we're not here to argue it's his masterpiece.
3,2,1,You needn't look so grim.
2,0,0,You're my first client to ask for the death penalty.
2,0,0,If we play our cards right, I can get you life.
2,2,0,When I said 'delete your profile', I meant Facebook.
3,0,0,Okay, so my first question is "Why don't you tell no tales?"
3,0,1,The defense rests in peace.
3,0,0,Don't worry, just plead guilty and you'll get a life sentence.
3,0,0,I don't think the death penalty will be invoked.
3,5,2,No! Just saying"It was their time" won't work.
4,0,0,You should be worried. Judge Hatcher just lost his wife.
3,0,0,You've killed how many?
2,0,0,Larry, the grim reaper look isn't a great choice to wear to your hearing this morning.
3,1,0,Good news, you're eligible for the death penalty.
5,0,0,Relax, all the jurors are death-qualified.
3,0,0,You're a dead man with that plea.
3,1,0,I'm gonna recommend the death penalty.
2,2,0,Credibility..may be an issue.
3,0,0,So wait, you're saying you're not a Dementor?
2,0,0,OK fine, there may be no eyewitnesses. But haven't you ever heard of circumstantial evidence?
3,1,0,Strange how we keep getting hung jurors.
4,1,1,Don’t worry – just last week I got Pestilence off on a misdemeanor.
3,1,0,But the scythe does fit.
2,0,0,Yes, but, 'Death comes for all' is not a legal defense.
2,0,0,Don't worry, I'm going to challenge the facial recognition technology they used.
3,0,0,The jury wants to know if the death penalty is off the table in your case
3,0,0,You need not have dressed up for my wrap-up.
3,1,0,What do you mean this IS your most professional look?
4,0,1,You're looking at life, pal.
3,1,0,The DA nixed the chess match deal.
3,0,0,Next time don't walk around the suburbs in a hoodie.
2,0,0,Remember: You’re the EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGED Reaper.
2,2,0,Your outcome is looking grim.
2,0,0,Think positive!
3,0,0,That vanishing cream company will pay through the nose.
9,1,1,The judge thinks he saw you in a Bergman movie. Yes or no.
8,1,0,Good news. They're going for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Somehow I just don't think that ' Guilty, With An Explanation' will work .
3,1,0,Keep your mouth shut.
3,1,0,What made you think the sickle would get through security?
3,0,0,I've told you: there's no capital crime in divorce court
2,2,0,I strongly suggest you take the Fifth.
3,1,0,They can't acquit, the hood actually fits
3,1,0,Stop pointing at the jury and telling them that one day you will be coming for them.
3,1,0,Don't look so grim, you reap what you sow!
3,0,0,The good news is we don't have to worry about the death penalty.
2,0,0,Are you certain you paid your taxes?
3,0,0,Don't worry. The preponderance of evidence will prove the defendant lost that chess game to you.
2,0,0,Right now it's a divorce case. Come back later.
2,2,0,The jury isn't buying it -- cheating death just isn't a crime
3,1,0,No, no . . . _you're_ going to be executed.
3,0,0,I don't think they'll go for a "life" sentence in your case.
3,1,0,How would you feel about a sentence of life without parole?
3,2,2,Actually, it doesn't matter if you are death destroyer of worlds - she still gets the house
3,0,0,Bit late for a call for reform of capital punishment
3,1,0,No. They're not sentencing you to "just be yourself."
2,0,0,I Think that I think that you must me more forthcoming than that.
2,0,0,I am worried that the jury may have found your alibi quite hollow.
2,4,0,You do know they are asking for death?
2,0,0,When I said "hung jury," I was only speaking figuratively.
2,2,0,Let's take the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,I think you'll like him, he's a hanging judge.
6,0,1,My last lawyer seemed more optimistic!
3,0,0,If you insist on testifying on your own behalf, downplay the grim thing and talk up the reaping.
2,0,0,So, your plea is justifiable homicide?
3,0,1,You're early--the penalty phase comes after the verdict."
2,0,0,Don't look so grim.
3,2,0,I think a saffron robe would look friendlier.
3,0,0,Problem with all your alibi witnesses...
5,0,0,"For the record, is 'Gangsta in the Hood' your legal name?
2,0,0,I knew she never saw my face...my eyes are green not blue
3,0,1,Nothing is certain, Mr. Death, but taxes.
2,0,0,If you're found guilty, it will be a life for Death decision.
4,3,0,The judge believes he can try you in absentia.
3,0,0,In this case nothing can be said to be certain, except death and possibly taxes
3,1,0,If a jury can find O.J. innocent, I'm sure you'll be fine.
4,0,0,No, you can't request the death penalty just to 'get out of here'.
3,0,0,Could I possibly ask you to use 'Your Honor' instead of 'You're next'?
3,1,0,It's admissible as a dying declaration
2,0,0,Sorry, but being withdrawn and feeling invisible are indefensible!
2,0,0,It's looking grim. You'll probably get life.
3,0,0,Mr Reaper, I wouldn't advise taking the fifth if I were you...
2,0,0,They're offering manslaughter, and I think you should seriously consider it.
2,0,0,Sorry, but i think the Judge will find you lack testamentary capacity.
3,0,0,Plead the 5th amendment.
2,2,0,No, no...it's the other way around: stare at the prosecutor, not the jury.
3,1,1,I'm sure you'll have the last word on this.
4,0,0,That's not what I meant by 'professional dress.'
2,2,0,I don't suppose you could manage to show up in a pure-as-the-driven-snow color tomorrow?
3,1,0,According to my file, the prosecution rests tomorrow.
3,1,0,Don't worry... I have a Plan B.
2,2,0,I'm your third lawyer. What happened to the other two?
2,0,0,This time on the stand, try not to look so grim.
3,0,0,Sorry, the death penalty doesn't apply here.
2,0,0,No, hung jury is actually NOT a good thing
2,0,0,OK. They’ve assembled a new jury. No more frog curses.
3,1,0,Sorry, this crime doesn't qualify for a death sentence.
7,0,1,Wear gloves when you place your hand on the bible.
3,1,0,We'll plea-bargain for death.
2,2,0,What do you mean who's taking over the case once I'm gone?
3,0,0,I told you to wear a suit today.
3,0,0,Well you're not making jury selection any easier.
3,0,0,You look awfully grim.
3,1,0,Yes, senatorial confirmation is scary but I still think you should give them your name.
3,2,0,I agree, losing the scythe should help your defense
3,0,0,It's going well. This jury isn't going to vote against you.
2,0,0,No, I have not seen any Ingmar Bergman films.
2,0,0,Don't worry - 'until death do you part' is now negotiable.
6,0,0,You seem familiar, but I can't quite place the face.
2,0,0,The judge wants to know where you got the robe with the hoodie.
3,0,1,At least I have a nose.
3,0,0,I'm sorry, the judge refused to accept your plea of death
2,0,0,Judge Zachary is offering leniency if you could maybe alphabetize the list.
3,0,0,As your attorney, I recommend you take the plea deal.
2,0,0,You're asking for it.
3,0,0,There is one big hole in our case.
2,0,0,The hung jury joke might have been a bad call.
5,2,0,Now, let me get this straight ... you prefer to settle out of court and bargain with the devil?
3,2,0,I know there's nothing wrong with a hoodie, but could you try to wear a suit when you testify?
3,0,0,You're facing life.
3,1,0,I know that is the name you prefer and have always gone by but I feel it prejudices the jury.
3,0,0,This does end well for you
2,2,0,I really don't think they'll believe you're a monk.
2,2,0,If it's any consolation, they named the penalty after you.
3,2,0,It's looking pretty grim.
3,1,0,You call that your smile?
4,2,3,You realize, if this goes badly, you may get life.
2,0,0,Unfortunately, some of the jurors are against the death penalty.
3,1,0,Yes, things look grim.
3,1,1,Does the Angel of Death have any ideas? Because I'm out of ideas.
3,0,0,So this is what your firm meant when they told me that my case looked grim.
2,0,0,The good news is the Death Penalty is off the table.
3,1,1,When you identify the perpetrator, don't point.
4,2,3,We've got an excellent case--they have no witnesses.
2,3,0,They think you could be useful on death row.
3,0,0,Eventhough the jury see themselves in you, my advice remains for you not to testify.
3,1,0,No, I do not think you have one of those faces people trust.
3,1,0,Lucky for you, we don't have the death penalty here.
2,0,0,You'll get the last laugh.
2,0,0,Luckily, capital punishment doesn't apply in your case!
3,0,0,When the DA asks you your occupation, say you work for a collection agency.
3,1,0,Contrary to your objections, I still intend to argue for life.
3,0,0,What do you mean I'm not getting into heaven?
2,0,0,Losing the scythe is a good start. Now about the hoody.
2,2,0,Not to worry- if the motion fails, we can file a writ of Habeas Corpus
4,0,0,No, I don't think "More Cow Bell" will help
4,0,0,You have to face the facts.
3,1,0,"Self-defence" may be a very tough sell.
4,0,0,I'm telling you for the last time, the jury is not going to be impressed that Beelzebub has given you excellent performance evaluations for the last 6000 years.
6,2,0,Just try to look innocent.
3,0,0,I just think the death penalty is too controversial.
3,0,1,Well, congratulations, you got the death penalty. But you can expect they're gonna give it the ol' college try anyway.
2,2,0,The worst sentence you could get is life.
3,0,0,Remember, call it the "Estate Tax."
2,0,0,The tip is included, if I remember.
6,1,0,Somehow, your hoodie doesn't read "Jeff Zuckerberg" to this jury, Mr. Reaper.
4,1,1,Permission to treat the witness as hostile?
2,0,0,For God's sake - plead guilty! What do you have to lose?
3,0,1,I think the death penalty is off the table
2,0,0,As your lawyer I advise you to plead the fifth.
3,1,0,I swear I have New York values and I didn't vote for Cruze
2,0,0,Whatever you do ... don't act proud.
2,0,0,Sir, you'll need to relax. He hasn't gotten the death penalty yet.
2,0,0,I was told there'd be no math.
4,0,2,Again, you have no priors, right?
3,0,0,You've been indicted on 8 billion counts of homicide.
4,1,4,I'm so sorry. You're facing life.
4,1,3,Where's the jury?
3,0,0,Me? But I paid for all day parking.
3,1,0,The optics aren't working in your favor.
3,0,0,Whatever happens, you don't want to appear too...what's the word I'm looking for...
4,0,0,"The judge isn't going to allow the hoodie".
5,0,1,I've always wondered....how do you eat?
2,0,0,I have a really hard time believing this win is good for me.
3,0,1,A white robe would look better in the witness box.
2,0,0,You have the right to remain silent.....but NOT invisible.
3,0,0,Is this the subcommittee hearing on Death and Taxes?
3,0,0,Try to look sorry.
2,0,0,Perhaps don't mention the 107 billion people you've killed.
3,2,1,He was already dead when you got there?
3,3,0,I think keeping the scythe out of sight would be a very good idea.
2,0,0,How ironic if you were to get a life sentence.
2,0,0,Trust me on this. Loose the Hoodie!
2,0,0,I urge you take the plea. They could give you life.
3,0,0,I know, but this is a civil case, not a death penalty trial.
2,0,0,Don't smile at the jury
8,0,0,...it may be too late for a cover up or face saving measures .
3,3,1,You didn't tell me you had actual skeletons in your closet.
9,1,0,Personally, I like your outfit. Not sure about the jury.
3,0,0,I guarantee, nobody saw my face.
2,0,0,Sorry! Scythes aren't allowed in the courtroom.
8,0,0,.... well, then again, you may be too easy to identify.
4,0,0,Remember to plead the Fifth if they ask you about your work with terrorists.
3,1,0,This time, don't hang the jury until after they announce the verdict.
4,2,0,Don't worry. The prosecutor is an empty suit.
3,0,1,I am confident I can get the death penalty off the table.
3,2,1,Professional courtesy doesn’t exempt you from taxes.
4,0,1,Scalia? He's the one in the middle, next to Roberts.
2,0,0,Not good,. She ID'd you.
2,0,0,We'll get him next time.
2,0,0,It couldn't hurt to meet with the stylist.
3,0,0,I told you it would be impossible to get a cancer patent.
2,0,0,I think you can get a reduced sentence if you'll admit to that whole WWII thing.
4,0,0,I think the Workers Comp judge isn't convinced your injury is preventing you from performing your job- his cousin just died.
3,0,1,I'm also a tax attorney
4,0,1,I'm afraid you got life.
2,2,0,Don't worry, I'm excellent at playing the devil's advocate
3,1,0,When I get close to you, I can hear the ocean.
2,0,0,Would it kill you to smile once in awhile?
2,0,0,Don't worry - the wages of sin are clearly specified.
3,0,0,There's precedent here. The judge has a heart murmur.
4,0,0,Remember, you're only here as an expert witness on mortality.
2,0,0,Not a word.
4,2,1,You're early. Sentencing is tomorrow.
2,0,0,You probably could get a hung jury but not the way you're thinking of.
4,0,0,We all know you did it so don't give me the sad puppy-eye look because it just doesn't work for you.
8,0,0,So, the counter-intuitive ensemble.
3,1,0,I don't know, I've never asked for the death sentence before.
3,0,0,Now, that's grim.
5,0,0,Leroy, its time we face the facts.
3,0,0,We like to refer to it as "paying backward".
3,0,1,A hung jury is a win for us.
2,0,0,We wouldn't be if you had worn a suit.
3,0,0,Remember, their fate was determined before you came upon the scene.
2,0,0,How many did you say St. Peter stole?
4,1,0,I'm thinking the hood defense--If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.
6,0,1,They want to impose the Life Penalty.
3,1,0,The judge won't accept the "trying to find yourself" defense.
7,0,0,Not to worry, nobody will know you're in "Witness protection"
3,0,0,Sorry, Bill Belichick took the look.
3,1,0,Face it. The verdict may be grim.
2,2,0,Mr Reaper, if you know anything about that scythe, now would be the time to tell me.
4,1,0,No, that won't fly; it really was worse than taxes.
3,1,0,Let's not kid ourselves, the IRS is a tough opponent.
5,1,0,I suggest a plea of not guilty by reason of inevitability.
3,1,0,Look, Death, the hoodie’s not helping your case here.
3,0,0,For our next court appearance, please make yourself more presentable
2,2,0,Be advised, the pen is mightier than the sickle.
3,0,0,For the last time, I'm not going to say "If the gloves don't fit, you must acquit!"
3,1,0,Maybe if you pull the hood back you'll appear less demonic to the jury.
2,0,0,I don't care if you just came from the WPT, this is a court of law and you should dress appropriately.
3,1,1,I have never seen such a blatant case of profiling.
2,0,0,Frankly, it's not looking good.
2,0,0,Looks like we can get them for damaging your livelihood.
4,2,0,My fault -- I did tell you to dress in business attire.
3,3,2,Did you have something to do with the hung jury?
2,2,0,I realize "he had it comin", but let's stick with self-defense.
4,0,0,Laughing when the judge says death sentence? Not our best move.
3,0,0,Look, if you really want to help, jurors 3, 7 and 12 could do with an "early release".
3,1,0,You WANT the death sentence?
5,1,1,Cheer up, you could get life.
3,3,1,I think I can get you life. Will that be weird?
2,0,0,A scythe? I thought you said Skype!
6,0,0,So when you get up there this time, try not to look so grim.
3,0,0,Not good. The jury thinks you're a hoodie.
3,0,0,He says he wants you to stop issuing warrants.
2,6,3,Are you absolutely certain you don't have any more skeletons in your closet?
3,0,0,I think you can take down your hoodie now.
4,0,0,What do you mean YOU want to make the closing statement?
2,0,0,I told you to wear your blue suit. You know this state does not have the death penalty.
6,2,1,It will be easier now that we succeeded in getting a separate trial for Taxes.
6,0,0,Okay ... I'll put you on the stand, but leave the Judge alone.
4,0,0,Don't worry Senor. Now that you are a client of Mossack Fonseca Wealth Management you can focus on your day job and we'll take care of your tax affairs.
3,0,0,I don't care what Shakespeare meant, stop saying 'the first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.'
2,2,0,Yes, everybody knows death is certain. But so are taxes, and that's why we're here.
3,2,1,First impressions are important to a jury. As your lawyer, I strongly advise a suit and tie next time.
3,2,1,Juror 6 is looking a little woozy. Please tell me that's because not of you.
3,1,1,You're dead.
2,0,0,I’ve already told you this, a hung jury is just an expression.
3,1,0,If we get an acquittal, you will have cheated, well, yourself.
5,2,7,Your priors are going to be a problem.
3,1,0,They found the scythe.
3,1,0,The whistleblower defense might have worked...but that was before you went and killed Scalia.
2,0,0,She wants the house, 3,500,000,000 souls, and the dog.
6,1,0,When we reconvene, be sure to bring the ill-filling glove.
4,2,0,Let's plea bargain for the death penalty.
4,0,0,I think you got the death penalty
2,0,0,If only Ted Cruz had won the election.
2,0,0,Call Lucifer and tell him to arrange a continuance.
5,0,0,We gotta show that 'Be not proud' is not in the public domain.
5,0,1,You've an appointment with me?
3,0,0,Mr. Reaper, there's just not much we can do to soften your image.
3,0,0,As your defense attorney, I'd recommend establishing eye contact with the jurors.
2,0,0,So...you were homeless in Hollywood after college!?! What ever happend to your fiance? (Reaper) I think you KNOW what happened to her, don't you...that's why i'm here. So GO TO HELL @#$%&*!?!
3,1,1,I'm not going to lie to you, things look grim.
3,1,0,I told you business casual!
3,1,0,All I'm saying is that the hoodie looks menacing, Karl. Would it have killed you to put on a suit like I asked?
3,0,0,I'm sure we can get it bumped down to three trillion counts of murder instead of five.
4,0,0,Sentencing is Monday. Do you have a different outfit you can wear?
2,0,0,As your attorney, I can only say that your suit will just make you look more guilty.
2,0,0,They want to give you life.
2,0,0,Surrender the scythe; you walk.
2,0,0,...has a fool for a client.
6,0,1,The judge says no hoodies.
2,0,0,Just to let you know, the judge is giving you the evil eye.
3,1,1,When you said underworld, I thought you meant mob related.
2,2,0,We have to prove this guy had a death wish.
2,0,0,Guilty until proven innocent, in your case.
3,0,0,It was a senseless death - we'll just plead insanity.
2,0,0,"I'm afraid you're going to have to face the music".
3,0,0,Kris Kringle won his case!
2,0,0,Ya know, that outfit doesn't exactly exude innocence.
2,0,0,It wasn't me.
2,0,0,We're just going to plead the fifth.
4,1,0,At least capital punishment is out of the question.
2,0,0,Our defense is going to be that you were "paranormal" at the time of the robbery.
4,1,0,This is the first time anyone has tried the "necessary evil" defense, so we'll see how it goes.
2,0,0,Business casual works for most clients, but in your case it might not have been such a good idea.
2,0,0,Don't worry - nobody cheats Death.
2,3,0,When I told you to take the fifth, I didn't mean dimension.
2,0,0,Telling the jury that they are welcome to the dark side is not a good idea!
3,0,0,Headless horseman defense will not work
3,1,0,A death sentence will not change your life in any way.
3,1,0,Bad news. They're going for the life sentence.
2,0,0,Your arguments in opposition to physician-assisted suicide appear self-serving.
4,0,0,Are you arguing for, or against?
2,0,0,Smile. It will help you connect with the jury.
7,0,1,The offer is"Death without the possibility of parole".
2,0,0,With your background, I recommend you cop a plea.
3,1,0,You can't give up now. My wife just took out a million-dollar life insurance policy.
2,0,0,First time offenders get the born-again treatment.
3,0,0,I guess it's time to break it to you - I don't think the jury believes you are Darth Vader.
3,0,0,There's so much evidence against you, the jury wants to give you the death penalty AGAIN!!!
2,0,0,Relax. Last year I got the Four Horsemen off with nothing more than probation.
3,1,0,Somehow I don't think this is the best way to avoid suspicion, governor.
2,0,0,Some good news: they don't have fingerprints.
2,2,0,Well you tell me. ..You're the expert in the death penalty.
6,2,0,If you cooperate, they'll take you off the table.
2,0,0,Frankly, this is my first death penalty case.
2,0,0,You're worried about the composite?
3,1,0,I want to win one of these before I die.
4,1,0,Just say that you weren't there.
2,0,0,No, no, you still have your mojo without your scythe.
3,1,0,Darn it, I really shouldn't have jaywalked.
3,0,0,We move for dismissal. Of the three invisible men at the scene of the crime the police brought only my client in for the line up.
3,1,0,You may be a good teacher, but you still killed all your students.
3,0,0,I'm pretty certain we'll beat the murder charge, but there's no escaping the back taxes
3,0,0,I believe you've met judge and jury.
2,4,1,Don't worry, I was the Devil's Advocate all through law school.
3,1,0,I'm sure the prosecution will not go for the death penalty, it would be redundant.
3,1,0,Fortunately, the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,The best I can get you is life without parole.
2,2,0,I don't mean to rain on your parade, but the death penalty is serious.
3,1,0,You're my legal aid attorney?
3,0,0,Don't tell the judge the pain is gone.
2,0,0,Yes, I'm all for the death penalty, but this is traffic court.
2,0,0,Let's go over your testimony. The last time you saw her she was still alive...
3,1,0,Not sure they'll think the death penalty plea will make it even.
3,0,0,As my defense attorney, you say the only option for jaywalking is lethal injection or hanging?
2,0,0,Must you be so doom and gloom about everything?
3,1,0,And please stop telling me things are looking grim.
3,1,0,I'm thinking hung jury.
3,1,0,Please stop pointing at the jurors.
3,0,0,I told them your scythe was a farm implement but they are insisting that it's an offensive weapon
2,2,0,Here's the offer - you plead to one count of murder, and no contest to the other 6,999,999,999 counts.
3,0,0,Just tell the jury that, "the devil is in the details"!
3,1,0,I guess you don't have a problem with the Death Penalty here.
6,0,0,They must convict, if the hoodie fits.
6,1,0,As you might expect, the outlook is pretty grim.
3,0,0,They call you, Robin Hoodie.
2,0,0,Statistically speaking, your odds are pretty good.
4,0,1,Don't worry, I've never lost a case on facial insufficiency.
3,1,0,Your chances look grim.
2,0,0,I think I can get this judge to give you life.
4,0,1,Coincidence? You've identified at every crime scene!
3,0,0,And please don't laugh so loud when you hear the verdict!
3,0,0,The defense calls Al Cowlings to the stand.
2,0,0,We're getting killed.
3,1,0,Try not to give the jury a blank stare.
5,0,0,My client pleads the privilege against self-recrimination.
3,1,1,Sorry buddy, I think you're getting life.
2,0,0,But if you take it off Jamal, you're DEFINITELY going to lose.
3,1,0,I hate to tell you this, but you don't have a "chance in hell"of being acquitted.
3,0,0,The prosecution is pushing for the life penalty.
3,1,0,It seems counter-intuitive but a death sentence is not actually in your favor.
3,1,0,Please stop referring to it as the "you penalty".
3,1,0,Really ? This again. I told you I am not going to call you Mr. Grim Reaper. Just Mr. Reaper. It works better with juries and I think is just sounds more professional.
2,0,0,Let's face it, you can't win this one.
3,1,0,Off the record, does that come in a pinstripe?
2,3,0,They don't exactly 'give you' the chair.
3,0,0,I've represented worse.
3,1,0,I though we agree you would smile
2,0,0,Our problem is the jury will find it hard to sympathize with you.
3,0,0,I have to be honest, it's looking pretty grim.
2,0,0,It doesn't look good. The judge was a huge David Bowie fan.
2,0,0,Is it OK if I were to refer to you as 'my client'?
6,1,2,And remember, no mention of your contacts in the underworld.
2,0,0,Okay fair, he did say a commuted life sentence, but...
3,0,0,They got Al Capone, but I think we're good.
3,1,0,The jury's here... look innocent.
8,1,0,I'm doing this work pro malus.
3,0,0,I hear that you're the master of jury tampering.
2,0,0,They're offering you the death penalty. I recommend you take it.
2,0,0,Try not to look so grim; we will file an appeal.
3,0,0,A dark suit without a hood would have worked better.
3,2,2,Look if we lose it's not going to kill you.
2,0,0,No, death without parole isn't an option.
4,1,0,Can you come back tomorrow, after closing arguments?
2,2,0,They said you'll be given a fate worse than you
2,0,0,In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except taxes.
3,1,0,Mr. Reaper, there is still the outstanding issue of your bill.
3,0,0,So, we're going for the death penalty, not eternal life on parole?
3,0,0,Why the long face---we're winning, aren't we?
2,0,0,They gave you death, but just don't come for yourself.
3,1,0,Being dead is usually a good alibi.
3,2,0,Finding an unbiased jury might be a problem.
3,1,0,Remember to look the jury in the eye.
5,1,0,Mortal coil? Not me, lawyer client privilege!
2,0,0,The judge's ruling is that you cannot bring the scythe with you into the courtroom. It made all of the attorneys nervous, even me.
2,0,0,This is traffic court, so I'm afraid the death penalty is off the table.
4,0,0,Look, I know it works for Zuckerberg, but...
3,0,0,I'm sorry, but "I was just doing my job" is not a valid defense.
2,0,0,You see, I usually try to keep my clients off death row.
2,0,0,Remember, if the hood don't fit.....you must acquit......!
4,1,2,Soooo, no matter which way the jury goes, we're OK. Right?
5,0,0,Try telling the jury I'm the ghost of holidays past.
2,0,0,Sorry, but it looks like you're going to get Life.
3,0,0,Ok i admit when the marriage vow said 'Til Death Us Do Part' i didn't think i would be paying you $300 an hour to make it happen!
2,0,0,Our defense is obsessive-compulsive disorder.
2,0,0,I'd say getting the death sentence is a win-win.
3,0,0,So you've received the death penalty before?
3,1,0,Well, you could accept the plea deal to become a Life Coach in Canada.
3,0,0," I know it's your job, but I don't think that will work with the jury".
3,0,0,We're basing our defense on hoodie prejudice, OK?
4,0,0,Look, the evidence clearly states that you bargained for a one way ticket, not round trip.
8,0,0,And what is the impact you hope to create among the jurors? Will your current look inspire that, do you think?
3,0,0,Our biggest disadvantage? While very explicit the video shows all of you but your face.
2,0,0,You're right, I don't think the Most Wanted poster is what gave you away...
2,2,0,I'm sorry but this state no longer has the death penalty.
2,0,0,I told you, dress like you are going to church, not to Hell.
4,0,0,They offered you a life sentence
3,0,0,No guarantees, but I'm pretty sure I can get you 20 to death.
3,1,0,Yes, Community Service, but...
2,0,0,They're going for your penalty.
3,0,0,No juror's gonna find you guilty!
3,0,0,Sure, mortality is inevitable, but it's not a defense.
2,0,0,Don't worry. I'll kill him on the cross-exam.
8,2,0,I know you want the death penalty but this is traffic court.
2,0,0,Requesting the death penalty would seem self-serving.
3,0,0,Look into my eyes and tell me the truth!
2,0,0,If it breaks our way you could get life.
2,0,0,The Big Guy upstairs sends thoughts and prayers....the guy downstairs sends me.
3,1,0,Try not to look so grim.
4,1,0,I recommend that you take the Fifth.
2,0,0,It would be counterproductive to tell the judge you know where he lives.
3,1,0,The good news is we're in Texas.
2,2,0,Well, a life sentence would be pretty ironic.
3,0,0,Following orders of Sauron is not a good defense.
2,2,0,The hoodie is not helping us.
4,2,0,I guess no matter what, it's a Death sentence.
2,0,0,I'm sure you will be happy to hear it's a hung jury.
3,0,0,I talked to the prosecutor, he's not going to seek the death penalty
3,0,0,I'll try to get you time served and a millennium in Purgatory.
3,2,2,We're good, as long as they don't bring up your priors
3,1,0,It's important the jury doesn't know where you're coming from.
3,1,0,Well you knew what they say about death and taxes...
2,0,0,Don't be so grim. We're winning.
2,4,0,Remember: she was dead when you got there.
3,0,0,Just let me do the talking, please.
2,0,0,Yes, it's a penalty. And this is another reason you should let me do the talking.
3,0,0,Mr. Reaper, didn't I suggest a wardrobe change for court?
2,0,0,Cool it. That vacant stare gives me the creeps.
3,1,1,No, that would be cruel and unusual in this state.
4,0,0,Poker face, not blank stare.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, but they want you to do life.
3,1,0,I though I was off the table.
4,0,0,When they told you we would do this "pro bono," who were you talking to?
3,3,3,It's inevitable. You're gonna have to pay taxes.
3,0,0,Now, don't say you can't remember.
3,0,0,Is my Facebook profile picture going to be a problem?
6,0,1,Your CPA is dead? Now you tell me?
2,0,0,Frankly, I don't think the outfit is helping us.
3,4,2,Of course, you have the final say.
2,0,0,We need for you to reap the benefit of the doubt from the jury
8,0,0,I think we're losing. You have an empty suit.
3,1,0,This issue has been briefed to death.
3,0,1,They're demanding complete transparency.
2,0,0,Try not to come off as arrogant, evasive, or dead.
3,2,2,Just think, this trial has us both staring at death.
2,1,0,Do you still have that buddy that can help you cheat death?
7,0,0,Was Immortality still in the carriage when you dropped off the hitch-hiker wearing the Tulle Tippet?
2,2,0,I'll do the talking. You do the pointing.
2,0,0,From beyond the grave Mr. Drumph insists, "I'll sue!"
2,0,0,Don't give me that look; prison's an upgrade.
2,0,0,They can't invoke the death penalty, that would be double indemnity.
2,0,0,Don't worry, they can't sentence you to you.
3,0,0,Well for starters, instead of leading the dearly departed to the afterlife, you took him to an After Hours Strip Club.
4,0,1,Remember to give the jury your killer smile.
3,1,0,I don't think you can plea bargain for the death penalty
2,2,0,You must testify that he died of supernatural causes.
2,2,0,I think the death penalty is our best option.
2,0,0,This doesn't look good.
3,4,2,I don't think I can get you life.
4,0,0,Better bring the pitchfork tomorrow.
2,0,0,Should I bother having my parking validated if we lose?
3,0,0,You think we need to talk about reconsidering MY defense strategy? Well, I think we first need to talk about reconsidering YOUR outfit.
12,0,0,Not now, I'm busy.
2,2,0,I just don't think an assisted suicide defense is going to work in your case.
2,2,0,I don't care if it was his time, do not kill any more of the jurors.
3,1,0,No eyewitnesses, but you still don't look innocent to the jury.
3,0,0,So, you're hoping for the death penalty?
2,0,0,Don't take the deal. Life plus 80 is a heck of a lot worse than a sentence of death for you.
3,0,0,No - you don't need a shave!
3,1,0,I have repeatedly said there is no dress code here!
4,0,0,Can't they call you by your first name, Angel? Always with the "Mr. Of Death."
5,2,0,You didn't tell me about your record.
2,0,0,You want a change of venue to where?
4,0,0,They are pushing for the Death Penalty
3,0,0,Given the current field, I do believe you're on solid legal footing.. but, still- I strongly recommend waiting until 2020.
2,3,0,Just remember when the time comes I'm doin this pro bono.
3,0,0,Okay so you can go lethal injection or your scythe?
2,0,0,If you don't tell them it was God's will, they are going to pin this rap on you.
2,0,0,I'm going for a hung jury. Whether if you want me to use rope or fallacious arguments is completely your call.
3,0,0,I have to warn you, this could become pretty grim.
3,0,0,What do you mean, look on the bright side?
2,1,0,Do you have to be so dramatic? It's only a parking ticket.
2,0,0,No, you may not "take out" Juror #7.
5,1,0,OK, no scythe is good, but I told you to wear a suit and tie.
6,1,0,Is this about your mother again?
2,0,0,You're saying your wife accidentally fell on your scythe?
2,0,0,You'll have to get yourself off death row.
3,2,1,Now remember, you're in "Resource Management".
3,0,0,We just need to leave room for reasonable doubt. If the cloak doesn't fit, you must acquit!
3,2,1,If they find the sickle.....we're in a pickle.
3,3,0,I'm pretty sure I can get the terrorism charge dismissed, but the TSA and the judge aren't buying your "farm implement" excuse...
7,1,0,The judge says metaphysical flights aren't deductible unless your Boss signs off on them.
3,0,1,My best advice? Be not proud.
2,0,0,We'll plead solo.
3,1,0,Going with reasonable doubt. You good with reasonable doubt?
5,0,1,I'm pretty sure we can wrangle joint custody of the kids, but she's probably going to get the pale horse.
2,0,0,I've had this judge before. Copyright infringement on the phrase 'Death Penalty' is totally winnable.
2,0,0,We've got to claim something besides mistaken identity
2,0,0,We have to prove that you were no where near 'political civility' over the last twelve months.
3,2,0,Nice to finally meet you face to hole.
3,0,0,Frankly, it looks grim.
5,1,0,Character witnesses are going to be a problem.
3,2,1,Do your prefer Grim or Mr. Reaper.
3,0,0,Mr. Reaper, the hoodie is not helping.
2,2,0,I'm going to need you to stop hanging the jury. Thanks.
2,2,0,the judge insists that we habeas him a corpus.
3,0,0,Remember, we're angling for the death penalty
3,2,2,Don't worry, I rehearsed: if the sickle doesn't fit, you must acquit.
2,0,0,Don't worry, they aren't seeking the death penalty.
3,2,1,The judge has decided to move the trial away from Sleepy Hollow....
3,1,0,Given your history, citing diminished responsibility might not be the best way forward.
3,0,0,Well, it is a matter of life and death, but...you already know that.
3,0,0,Look on the bright side, you might get to meet Aaron Hernandez.
10,0,1,I don’t care if it’s your “brand.” We’re trying to beat a wrongful death charge and you’re not helping.
2,2,0,You realize it will be hard for you to deny these accusations.
2,2,0,So, . . . Explain to me again how you made partner. . .
3,0,0,the good news is no one got a clear look at the suspect's face.
2,0,0,You're not afraid of the death penalty, are you?
3,0,0,I want to remind you that I am not being paid on the contingency that you are found innocent
3,1,0,in Under no circumstances do I want you to look directly at the jury.
2,2,0,We're going to call it a 'butter knife.'
3,1,0,What do you mean by natural causes?
4,0,0,It's a death penalty case. There is no statute of limitations.
2,0,0,It all depends if Jimmy Hoffa's body is where you say it is
3,1,0,We might have some trouble explaining the scythe found at the scene of the crime.
3,0,0,Sorry, I couldn't find anything else to wear
2,0,0,They offered us a plea deal: Parole without life.
2,0,0,It was his time" may not be the best defense.
2,0,0,Be prepared to reap only what you sue.
3,1,0,You'd be dead if it weren't for me.
2,0,0,Didn't I tell you to wear your blue suit and tie to court today?
6,4,1,I can get you eternity, with 10 years off for good behavior.
3,3,2,When I said professional attire, I meant suit and tie.
5,0,0,Objection!
2,0,0,What will actually happen if I don't file by April 15?
6,5,1,Now they will read each of the 107,343,279,045 counts.
2,0,0,So your defense plea is that, he was on your doorstep trying to cheat you?
3,0,0,I don't think "I was profiled because I was wearing a hoodie." is a winning defense.
3,0,0,Try smiling.
2,0,0,The name of the penalty is purely coincidental
6,1,0,Well, who else can we pin it on?
3,1,1,Ironically, they want the death penalty.
3,0,0,Yes, I get it, our case is dead.
3,1,1,Hey, it's called reasonable doubt.
6,0,0,The bad news, it's the death sentence. The good news, they can't find anyone to do it.
3,1,0,Okay, when the new judge arrives, please let me do all the objecting and pointing of fingers.
4,0,0,I'll promise the jury you won't come calling anytime soon.
3,1,0,It's hard to put a good face on this.
2,2,0,I told you... the death penalty's off the table!
2,0,0,Just be thankful this state abolished the death penalty.
2,0,0,I just don't think a hoodie conveys the right message.
2,2,0,I never thought you'd be on trial for insider trading
3,0,0,Ironically, this isn't a death-penalty state, so you don't have to worry about that.
2,2,0,My wife told me this case would kill me.
3,1,0,You will need to explain why the death rate is still one each.
3,0,0,I don't think they'll accept the death penalty as a plea bargain.
2,0,0,Do you think the glove will fit?
2,0,0,Just so you know, that getup is not helping your case.
3,1,0,Yea, it will be a hung jury.
2,2,0,Remember, it's important to make eye contact with the jury
3,1,1,I'll get the case dismissed for your inability to face your accuser.
2,0,0,A plea of self-defense won't fly well in your case.
2,0,0,Just look the jurors in their eyes and they will see your point.
2,3,0,How many?
3,0,0,This isn't what I meant by business formal.
3,1,0,They're asking for the death penalty, but I don't think they've thought the logistics through properly.
2,0,0,Don't be so grim. There were no eyewitnesses!
2,2,0,Do you have any cloaks in soothing pastels?
3,0,0,I love your half glass full attitude, it makes me feel so alive
2,0,0,Let's go over this again; Your defense is "mortality"?
3,0,1,This is not what I had in mind when I told you to dress for a somber occasion.
3,0,0,Victims wearing hoodies typically do not fare well.
3,0,0,A recommendation for mercy might be a tough sell.
3,1,0,The judge is in poor health. He'll listen.
2,0,0,That's a hollow argument.
3,4,0,Don't give me that blank look.
3,1,0,We'd like to request a brief recess to, uh, kill your Honor.
3,0,0,Not guilty? But you're still wearing the hoodie?!
3,0,0,It's obviously a case of mistaken identity.
2,0,0,They want you to try on the glove.
3,1,1,Did you go over all your aliibis?
2,0,0,They won't take the death penalty off the table, the sentence may be suicide.
3,0,0,Don't give me that look
3,1,0,Its a pretty big list. Can't you just pick out the famous ones?
3,2,1,You were advised to wear a suit and tie
2,2,0,In spite of the preponderance of evidence, I think you are coming off really well.
3,1,0,They're leaning toward the death penalty.
3,1,0,You should have told me you once worked for the IRS.
2,6,3,No- I decide which jurors to eliminate
3,1,0,Don't count on a sympathetic jury.
3,2,2,Remember, he was dead before you got there.
3,1,0,Might help with the jury if you had a nickname other than "Grim." How do you feel about "Scooter"?
3,2,2,It was her idea to put it in the vows: "Till Death do us part."
3,0,0,Wait, your the Grim Reaper? I'm not sure i'm on the right side of this case anymore!
3,0,0,I can't emphasize this enough: Eye Contact
3,3,2,If we win don't hug me.
3,1,0,It's do or die, not open and shut.
2,0,0,Think of it as a vacation, and rest up for all the extra work you'll have waiting for you when you get back.
5,1,0,If your priority is the scythe, I'm afraid she's gonna take all of the pale horse.
2,2,0,How many victims ?
2,0,0,Your new sickle holster is amazing. I couldn't even tell you are carrying.
6,0,0,No, his last name is Issa, not Torquemada.
3,0,0,Remember, I asked you to wear a suit to make a good impression.
2,0,0,Help me out. I'm dying here.
10,0,0,Remember, you didn't see nothing, hear nothing, or do nothing, you weren't even there.
2,0,0,On the bright side, the transition will be a breeze.
2,2,0,Try to look a little less mortified.
2,0,0,You got to face up to it...
8,0,0,You're right. It didn't kill me to object
2,1,0,Yes, you can plead self-defense if you're not bothered by loud laughter.
4,0,0,We can't ask for a continuance. This is a tax case.
3,0,0,I hope you're not losing your head over this trial.
2,0,0,If you agree never to bother the judge, you’re free to go
2,0,0,You do realize you're looking at life here?
2,2,0,You went to Vassar with Bob? His brother, Jim used to live in my building. Small world.
6,1,0,What's the catch?
2,0,0,Would you be willing to do community service?
2,2,0,You're killing me with this "for all eternity" talk.
2,0,0,Ok, but I don't know they'll agree to a death penalty plea deal.
5,1,0,Why in the world would I want to plea bargain for life imprisonment?
3,0,1,Look, we're in lower Manhattan-it'll be a jury of your peers.
2,0,0,So, how is Terry? In case you wonder, this is a reference to Terry Prachet.
3,0,0,Try not to look so grim. Juries notice things like that.
2,0,0,Take the plea or it's life.
5,0,0,You are looking at the 'you penalty.'
3,0,0,The prosecutor is going to push for the death penalty.
14,1,0,Please just stop with the, "I am death," speech. Okay?
8,0,0,They're going to ask for the Death Penalty, Let's accept it quick before they figure it out.
3,0,0,hello
3,1,1,They can see the guilt on your face."
3,0,1,In order to beat the prosecution, we need to get you ahead.
2,2,0,Watch out for Juror #4. Her grandmother just died.
2,0,0,At least this state no longer has the death penalty.
2,0,0,I don't know if the death penalty applies in your case.
3,0,0,They're trying to paint your intent as especially grim.
3,2,1,I'm glad you took my advice and left the scythe at home.
3,1,0,Just don't react when the judge mentions the death penalty.
3,0,0,I think we should take the plea deal. They've got a pretty strong case
3,1,0,Stop, stop. . . he said griM, not griN.
2,2,0,If I put you on the stand they'll see right through you.
4,0,0,Look, I'm sorry but they don't HAVE the death penalty in New York.
3,0,0,If it's life, I'm going for cruel and unusual punishment.
3,1,0,Evidently, Face Time is dead.
3,0,0,Were down to the heart and soul of the trial.
2,0,0,Don't worry, you're safe! They used facial recognition software.
3,1,0,The souls were nonexempt
2,0,0,I will take the 5th amendment!
4,1,1,Yes, your best chance at this point would be a hung jury.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, but you are not allowed to plead the fifth commandment.
3,0,1,Now don't forget. If we overcome the optics you have a shot at getting away with murder.
3,0,0,A recess because you "have a 2:00?" Seriously?
4,0,0,Remember to smile and look the jury right in the eye.
4,0,0,Don't look so grim,We can always appeal.
2,2,0,You have nothing to lose.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but the judge thinks you're a risk to the community.
2,0,0,When you're on the stand, whatever you do, don't touch the judge.
3,1,0,Just stare at the judge and we'll be fine.
3,0,0,123456788
2,0,0,This is going to be about reasonable doubt -NEVER take off the hood.
3,0,0,Of course I'm qualified, in my last case I was the Devil's advocate.
3,0,0,I know, I know, they told me they were out of lethal injection drugs.
3,2,1,We'll try and downplay your employment history, OK?
2,2,0,No, I'm only 30, I've just billed 99 years of work to my clients.
3,1,0,The best I can get you is life.
3,1,0,You;ve gotta stop pointing at the jurors and shouting 'You're next!"
2,0,0,I don't think 'monkish folderol' will be an effective defense.
3,0,0,On the flip side, you did invent the death penalty.
3,1,0,You will take " life in prison"!
2,0,0,So, I just need to touch your robe to get out of here?
3,1,0,Not one character witness will speak in your defense?
4,0,1,Just remember, they cheated you.
2,0,0,The bad news...you got Death...the good news...you are Death.
3,0,0,Funny? I find nothing funny about the Judge wearing a robe.
2,0,0,No one else saw you either.
4,0,0,It's immaterial to try to get life.
3,1,0,Your membership in Grimm Reapers Matters is not helping
5,1,0,But you never actually killed anybody, right?
3,0,0,Your smell of death is not good for our case.
2,3,0,They are having a tough time gathering a jury of your peers.
2,0,0,Too late, your low profile is not helping us at this stage of the process.
7,4,4,The judge asked if this is your first offense.
2,4,1,Take the plea. Otherwise, you're facing the You penalty.
3,3,0,Don't worry. They'll be happy to make a deal.
2,2,0,Good news. I got you the death penalty.
2,0,0,Forget it. There's no way you're getting life.
3,0,0,They're bailiffs at every door, there's no escaping, Death.
2,0,0,Your chances for acquittal look really grim.
3,1,0,Don't worry, we've got a killer strategy.
2,0,0,Our client should be here shortly.
2,2,0,Take the plea.
3,0,0,But , you've already received your sentence.
2,2,0,Stop saying, "Reap 'em and weep."
2,0,0,For the last time, there is no death penalty in this state.
2,0,0,What's the worst you could get - Life?
3,0,0,He took a plea, if you want I'm you'll have to sit at the defense table!
3,1,0,I told you the scythe wouldn't make it past security.
2,0,0,At least they can't hang you.
4,0,0,The only two things in life that are certain are death and taxes. That's why we want to hire you.
3,1,0,Don't worry, I've defended much worse
3,1,0,things are looking a little grim. that's not good in this case.
3,0,0,I've changed my mind about a pro Bono defense.
3,1,0,I dunno, can you make the jury like you?
2,2,0,Don't worry. They may find you guilty, but you won't get the death penalty.
3,0,0,You think black holes are for real?
3,1,0,But the most hurtful part was being accused of lacking judgment.
8,0,0,Not now! I'll finish this paperwork if it kills me...
3,0,0,Look on the bright side; the death penalty is probably out.
4,0,2,You've got stop saying 'It was just his time.'
4,0,0,We're gonna need you to cry
3,2,1,I wanted to let you know that I have really enjoyed this internship.
4,0,0,The jurors don't like your body language.
5,0,0,Lose the hoodie before the judge gets here.
5,0,0,What? You said to wear a killer suit.
2,0,0,I don't think anyone gives a damn about identifying my lawyer.
3,0,0,Ask for an appeal? Isn't that just a touch hypocritical?" "I don't think 'Just doing my job' will hold up in court.
4,1,0,So, you're claiming the guy was dead when you got there?
2,3,0,Don't mention your occupation while you're on the stand.
4,0,1,In your case, you'll receive the life penalty.
3,1,0,Let's just agree that the death penalty is a moot point
2,0,0,I told you to ditch the hoodie. It scares people.
3,1,0,The penalty is death, but we'll argue for time served.
5,0,0,You know, Donald, you have an aura about you.
2,0,0,Tell the judge I'm not entirely comfortable with the courts choice of my representation.
3,1,1,I already sold my soul.
2,0,0,I can get the death cases thrown out, but tax evasion....
3,0,0,When you asked me if I was pro bono, this is not what I had in mind.
2,0,0,I expect some difficulty seating an unbiased jury.
5,4,1,That's not what a hung jury means.
2,0,0,You might offer to play a game of chess to delay sentencing.
2,0,0,The jury is back and they look grim, Mr. Reaper.
4,1,0,I think we may have a problem finding impartial jurors.
3,0,0,Fine, but let me handle the jury selection.
3,1,0,I still don't see how your looks will help us win.
2,0,0,Are you the court-appointed attorney?
2,0,0,Trust me, the devil is in the details !
3,0,0,It's not looking good. The prosecution has you on 100 billion counts of homicide.
2,0,0,You're telling me it doesn't look good?
3,0,1,This outfit is not helping our case!
3,0,0,If you plead guilty, you will get life.
3,0,0,Don't forget to make eye contact.
3,0,0,You should have gone with the suit and tie.
3,1,0,I don't know if the death sentence is viable in Judge Judy.
3,2,1,Just tell them the Devil made you do it
7,3,0,"Death comes for us all" is not a good defense.
2,2,0,Could you not have worn something else to the hearing?
2,0,0,It wouldn’t kill you to smile a little more around the jury.
5,1,7,You just killed your chance for an acquittal.
3,0,0,Make eye contact with the jury.
3,0,0,Bad News - they just took the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,This puts a new spin on "Dead Man Walking"
5,0,0,The death penalty is not on the table.
2,2,0,I can promise you one thing, you won't get life.
2,0,0,Don't get discouraged. They're just not used to seeing a hoodie in court.
3,1,0,I suggest an Alford plea.
2,0,0,I can get you life.
4,0,0,Why didn't you wear your Justin Bieber mask like I told you to?
2,0,0,It's going to be very difficult to afford to avoid the death penalty.
3,0,0,Personally, I'm against it.
2,0,0,Look, I've been doing this for a long time, and I don't think dressing up in a coat and tie is going to help you with the jury.
2,3,0,Don't be so grim.
3,0,0,Well? Did you do it?
3,0,0,I'm sorry vicarious liability doesn't apply in murder cases
2,4,1,Try not to intimidate the witnesses
2,2,0,The plaintiff is having trouble facing you.
4,1,0,I'm so sorry, I know what a life sentence means to you.
2,0,0,So, I don't think we'll be able to get the death sentence off the table...
2,0,0,Let me guess, imaginary death panels, right?
5,0,0,Don't you think the death penalty is a bit harsh?
4,3,2,When you take the stand, try to be up-beat.
2,0,0,Witness: "I can't say for certain. It was either him or taxes."
10,1,0,Mr. Reaper, as your counsel, I am advising to stop claiming that you oversee all "encryptions".
2,2,0,Let's face it. Your future looks rather bleak.
3,0,0,In all the years as a defense lawyer, you are my first hallow case.
3,1,0,I'll go after her on Benghazi and the emails. If that doesn't work, you're up.
3,0,0,I think your number of priors are working against you, guy.
2,0,0,There is no legal president for striking a plea deal for the death penalty.
3,0,0,Perhaps advocating for the death penalty is a little premature.
2,2,0,You promised to wear a tie.
8,0,1,I tried but they won't take the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,They're going for the You Penalty
4,0,0,Something tells me he won't be sentenced to life.
3,1,0,I suggest a little fire and brimstone in your closing remarks.
3,1,0,We discussed this. You're not testifying.
3,0,0,Are you sure you want to go through with this case?
5,0,0,We can get you time off for good behavior.
3,1,0,Quit putting the death penalty back on this table.
3,1,0,Don't mention your occupation.
2,2,0,No, the death penalty is not off the table.
2,2,0,Jurors like humility. Don't keep saying that you're certain.
3,1,0,That would be a *hanged* jury.
3,1,0,You are lucky. Death has not been outlawed in this state.
5,1,0,No, there is no glove you can try to put on.
2,2,0,Yes, I remember specifically asking you to wear a suit.
2,0,0,No - they don't give the death penalty for jay walking in this state.
2,0,0,So, you're okay with the death penalty?
4,1,0,I think I can get it knocked down to 107 billion counts of manslaughter.
4,0,0,Frankly, it doesn't look good.
5,0,0,I know, but I've got a date to the prom tonight.
3,0,0,How can you plea the 5th when you don't even have a face?
2,2,0,The chances of a conviction are grim.
2,2,0,Leave it on: nameless and faceless relates more to Everyman.
3,2,1,No, you MAY NOT hold the scythe when you get on the witness stand.
3,2,0,Remember, we're trying to highlight your cuddly side
2,2,0,Stop saying things look grim.
5,1,1,No, despite what you may think, a hung jury does not mean you can go back to work.
2,0,0,"He Who Must Not Be Named" won't fly.
3,0,0,How does life without parole sound to YOU?
2,0,0,I don't care what you saw on Law and Order -- they're just not going to take a manslaughter plea.
2,2,0,You want life? Listen, I'm a good defense attorney, but not that good!
2,0,0,The criminal justice system doesn't like black hoodies.
2,0,0,I suppose not seeing you smirk can help.
3,0,0,Remember what we talked about...eye contact, eye contact, eye contact!
3,1,0,Trust me! If the court can turn a corporation into a person, it can turn you into one, too.
2,0,0,Great news--the prosecution wants you to get life.
3,2,1,We have to do some real work here to overcome your bad press.
2,0,0,I'm telling you it's a fair trade. I put this guy on death row, you give me 15 - 20 more years.
2,2,1,What do you mean you're confident it will be a hung jury?
2,0,0,Now I want you to give them your sunny-ist smile
3,1,0,Look, I can buy you some time, but you're gonna have to pay those back taxes.
3,0,0,When you testify, try to convey your repentance.
3,3,1,I made a deal with the jury they couldn't refuse.
3,1,1,The death penalty is off the table. But they're seeking 30 years to life at the circus.
3,0,0,The prosecution is going to ask for a larger court room so that they can present their 40 truckload list of alleged victims.
3,0,0,I must warn you. Trying to collect on your own life insurance is very tricky.
2,0,0,Tell me again how you were identified in the police line-up.
3,0,0,So, you are saying that a Hung Jury is my only chance? - I think I can take care of that.
3,0,0,Life, of course.
9,0,0,"Okay, now remember - our strategy is the inevitability of taxes." 'taxes' is in italics.
2,0,0,That's not what I meant by Opt-Out
2,4,2,So you weren't identified in the lineup?
3,1,0,I don't think we have to worry about the death penalty.
6,4,1,It's ok, we're claiming it's required by your religious beliefs
3,0,0,Is it too late to ask you where you went to law school?
3,0,0,You mean everyone at your law firm wears hoods?
3,1,0,The jury sent out a note asking what the death penalty would mean in your case.
3,0,0,I'll defend you but you have to stop staring me in the face.
3,1,0,Remember. You have the right to remain silent.
5,1,1,This looks tough. Do you have any character witnesses we could call?
2,0,0,They'll think your guilty if you look so grim.
2,2,0,I say we go for one count of hospice.
2,0,0,Chances look grim, Reaper.
3,0,0,You'll either get a life sentence or the death penalty. So it's a win-win.
7,1,0,You better prepare yourself for the death penalty.
2,0,0,Now I know that nothing is as certain as tax evasion
2,2,0,You should have paid your taxes.
2,0,0,You are in a "juxtaposition" this state banned the death penalty
4,0,0,Worst case scenario? You could get a life sentence.
2,0,0,They've offered life without parole.
2,0,0,I suppose it's inevitable that you became a tax lawyer.
2,0,0,You may be able to walk out of here with just a point of the wrist.
2,0,0,Visiting the judge in his quarters won't help your case.
4,2,1,No, I don't think we should go for the death penalty. Why do you ask?
2,0,0,The death penalty? OK, why not?
3,0,0,We can get a reduced sentence if you snitch on the big guy.
4,0,0,It's OK, smiling at the jury is overrated, anyway.
2,2,0,If you're asked, just say that you met Dante in college.
2,0,0,Sure it is all circumstantial but you have to admit you have been present at an awful out of murders
3,1,0,They don't understand that you would welcome the death penalty.
3,1,0,I'm afraid your DNA results are not encouraging.
2,0,0,Well, I guess they didn't go for the insanity defense.
2,0,0,25 to life seems like a pretty fitting sentence.
4,0,3,Perhaps you don't understand. In your case the death penalty is considered a punishment.
2,0,0,As your lawyer, I can't help you if you insist on wearing a hoodie
3,0,1,Look the jury in their souls.
2,0,0,Listen, J.J. Abrams will cameo you in the last 90 seconds, is that cool?
2,0,0,Don't look so glum. If you get life, I'm sure we'll win on appeal.
2,0,0,Don't worry, I'm experienced in wrongful termination.
3,1,0,We can appeal, but I don't think a different judge will grant you the death penalty.
2,0,0,I'm glad you didn't bring your scythe.
2,0,0,We just took the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,Perhaps we should discuss a plea bargain.
3,0,0,We should go with the "If the scythe don't fit, you must acquit defense."
2,0,0,They want you to take off your hoodie
6,3,0,You can relax, it's just the death penalty.
4,1,0,Take it! You'll be out in a 100 years with good behavior.
2,0,0,Bad news. They've taken the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,We can't plead insanity for ALL of them
2,2,0,When you say I'd better win this case, what exactly do you mean...?
2,2,0,Let's use the Star Wars defense.
5,0,0,Gross negligence to deliver a timely death is a slap on the wrist. You're looking at 6 months, minus Eternity already served..
2,0,0,It simple,tell them why you were in Samara and get rid of the hoodie
3,0,1,I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you don't look like a public defender.
2,0,0,On second thought, maybe the smile is a bad idea.
3,1,0,I think we can plea bargain for the death penalty.
3,1,1,I assumed you didn't have fingerprints.
3,0,0,You did "what" with the pitch fork?
2,0,0,You sure nobody saw you on the crime scene?
2,0,0,Was the shark at the dentist's?
2,0,0,Yeah, I'm gonna need you to pull that elbow back a little.
3,0,0,Don't look so grim Leonard-its only a minor traffic violation!
2,2,0,This is the one case where I advise leaving the hoodie on
5,0,0,You shouldn't have used facebook to announce your arrival
3,2,1,Even if we don't win, we've got a great shot at a miniseries.
3,0,0,You're right--it's pointless to try to get the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,In witness protection people won't recognize you.
2,0,0,No, this is not a death penalty state.
3,0,0,Now turn and face the jury.
2,0,1,There is no death penalty in this state.
2,0,0,Just plead the Sith
3,3,2,How many skeletons do you have in your closet?
3,1,1,I'm pretty sure they're not going to let me enter an appearance as "devil's advocate," what's your second choice?
6,0,0,I know that I told you to dress as though going to Church.
3,0,0,Is life good for you?
4,0,0,No! We're petitioning for sole custody, not soul custody!
2,0,0,Good News is, New York has no death penalty.
2,0,0,Trust me. This is not the end.
3,1,0,This is not what I meant when I said I needed a dramatic closing.
5,1,0,Another continuance, right?
3,0,0,Y'know you are going to have to face up to this some time.
2,2,0,I tried to tell you. "Friend of the corpse" is not a thing.
2,4,1,If the trial goes as planned, I should be able to get you the death penalty.
3,1,0,I hope you don't think I'm doing this pro bono just to get on your good side?
3,0,0,Can you drum up some character references?
3,1,0,So we're going to challenge eyewitness identification?
4,0,0,What do you think my odds are?
4,2,1,I don't think 'but that's what I do' is going to fly with the jury
2,0,0,Rumor has it they are concerned about executing the death penalty
2,0,0,When you're up on the stand, try not to look like you're dead.
2,0,0,I have to tell you, this is the first case I've had in which the plaintiff has demanded that a perfectly healthy person be removed from life support.
2,0,0,The judge isn't budging. No sickles in the courtroom.
3,1,0,Unless you're thinking of penalizing yourself, they're bluffing.
3,1,0,I knew the public defender would be the death of me.
3,0,0,I thought we agreed no hoodie.
2,0,0,Reject the premise of existence.
2,0,0,Well at least you won't have to worry about getting the death penalty.
2,0,0,I have no objection to the death penalty.
3,1,0,The eye witness could be a problem.
2,2,0,You should know better than anyone that when you don't pay your taxes, this sort of thing becomes inevitable.
3,2,1,For tomorrow, I'd suggest the light gray pin-stripe with a red tie.
3,1,0,You're looking at the death penalty.
3,0,1,Yes, it's called a 'wrongful death' suit, but don't take that personally.
2,2,0,Its 'Death and Taxes', not 'Death or Taxes'.
3,1,0,The average age of the jury is 85. What do YOU think the chance of your getting a favorable verdict are?
7,0,0,He’s impressed by your attempt to conjugate the Latin verb habeo, but rules that you cannot present your Writ of Habeam Corpus.
2,0,0,Looks bad, we've got a ghost of a chance of winning this case.
3,0,0,Be more optimistic, I intend to cloke you in an insanity plea!
2,0,0,I'm sorry, but I don't think there is any way you can avoid the death penalty.
3,0,0,Don't be such a pessimist.
4,0,0,I think you misunderstood me when I said we need to bury the evidence against you,
4,1,0,With a little luck, you’ll get life.
2,2,0,You've got a little something between your teeth.
3,2,1,Hi, I'm the devil's advocate.
2,0,0,that's not how the death penalty works
3,1,0,I think we should be focusing on bigger issues, but the answer to your question is ‘yes’ – if you're cleared of all charges, they will very likely return your scythe.
2,0,0,You do realize that my client is charged with loitering, don't you?
3,0,0,This isn't a good time to bring up your taxes.
3,0,0,I'm trying to convince them to give you the death penalty.
3,1,0,They'll have a hard time convicting without a scythe.
3,0,0,You're going to loose the jury with the hood and Grim Reaper crap.
3,0,0,No, I don't think they'll buy it was a mutual mistake
3,0,0,You had to know the guards would take your scythe.
3,0,0,Who do they think they are giving ME the death penalty?
3,2,2,Wear a suit and tie tomorrow, okay?
3,1,0,Look, we can plea down to misdemeanor possession of a scythe, but I can't do anything about the murder charges.
3,0,0,Wait, you WANT to be on Death Row?
2,0,0,Remember, don't make eye contact with the jury.
2,0,0,It was revenge for loss of face.
2,0,0,I don't think the death penalty will be an issue for you.
4,0,0,He's asking for three more weeks but I think we can get him down to next Tuesday.
6,1,0,Yes, I'm certain. I handle taxes, and you handle…you know, …what you handle.
2,2,0,They have eyewitnesses. There's no way they confused you with someone else.
2,0,0,No. Even if you plead guilty, they can't give you life.
2,0,0,No fingerprints on the scythe - they haven't got a case.
2,0,0,I think that you are carrying this "Hoodie" look a little to far.
3,0,0,... And as your attorney, I still have to advise you against "pleading the scythe."
4,2,0,I can only prove your innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt.
2,0,0,Take my wife - please.
2,0,0,Yes, but there's a difference between looking serious and looking grim.
3,0,1,Anybody see you?
2,0,0,Do you have to wear a hoodie, Mr. death?
2,0,0,They've decided to take the death penalty off the table.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, looks like it's going to be the life penalty...
3,0,0,In this courtroom, you are, at best, jury and executioner.
4,1,3,You're looking at life.
3,1,0,Unfortunately, this is not a death penalty state.
2,0,0,Try not to sound emotional.
3,0,0,They found your DNA on the scythe.
3,1,0,You could get life. It's unfortunate, but you have to appreciate the irony
2,0,0,If this trial was in Manhattan, we might have a chance, but here in Brooklyn, they've outlawed death, so you're out of luck.
3,0,0,Hipster coffee under a bridge? The apocalypse has begun.
3,0,0,Even if they don’t buy the argument that your presence was just ‘circumstantial’, Grim, do you really care if they give you death?
2,2,0,It is going to come down to whether the mask fits.
3,0,0,I know there is nothing certain except death and taxes so please let me finish.
2,0,0,Well, your alibis' not being able to show up does create a bit of a problem.
3,1,0,Sorry, evenen though you're Death, you still can't escape taxes...
3,0,0,What have you got to lose? Go for the death penalty.
3,0,1,Don't blame me. I told you to lose the hoodie.
2,2,0,I'm afraid you're sentenced to life. But it is without hope
2,0,0,Remember, no killing the judge.
2,0,0,Just face the jury with that blank look on your face.
2,0,0,It's the season's finale!"
2,2,0,We can negotiate a plea to avoid a life sentence.
3,1,0,Fortunately the judge has a macabre sense of humor.
3,2,0,You sure you want to enter a guilty plea...You'll be sentenced to 'Life'.
3,3,2,What the hell. Plead guilty.
3,0,0," The best we can do is Life without any chance of parole".
2,0,0,Wait a minute...you want the Death Penalty?
2,4,1,It will help with the jury if you appear a little less grim.
8,2,0,Sorry, but I can't hear you over the echo
3,1,0,Good news! Their eye witness testimony might be a problem.
2,0,0,Without the scythe I don't think they'll buy it.
3,1,0,Seriously, let me do the talking. No one has ever beaten Death.
3,1,0,Duck? No, I ordered chicken.
3,0,0,Are you sure you're not keeping anything from me, Mr. Spectre? It could affect the outcome of our case.
3,0,0,Any idea why your key witness is missing?
2,0,0,Reading the indictment, I was chagrined to learn your first name isn't 'Graham', Mr. Reaper.
2,0,0,Could have been worse. You could have gotten back-to-back life sentences.
3,0,0,Can you arrange a hanged jury?
3,1,0,Worse case scenario, it won't be cruel and unusual for you.
3,1,0,Stop snickering. The death penalty is a real thing.
2,0,0,There is no 'other' venue!
3,0,0,I think we'd do better with this jury if you could lose your head scarf.
3,1,0,I told you that black hoodies don't play well with juries.
4,0,0,The whole AARP chapter filed a no contact order against you.
3,0,0,The jury wants the death penalty. That's as good as an acquittal for you!
3,1,0,Apparently you can't stand your ground with a scythe.
2,0,0,And remember, nobody likes a negative Nelly.
3,1,0,it's not looking good...
2,0,0,I'm going to move for summary judgment.
2,2,0,I thought you'd buried the evidence
3,0,0,It he DNA tests on the scythe were negative.
7,1,1,You're right. The hoodie does make you less threatening.
4,0,0,What the judge is trying to say - you cant go round killing people willy nilly.
2,2,0,I see where you're coming from and I don't like it.
3,0,0,Please don't make eye contact with any of the jurors....that is, if in fact you actually have eyes.
3,1,0,Five 99-year sentences, running consecutively, sounds harsh, but I doubt you're in more than 70 years tops.
3,1,0,Try not to touch anyone else on the way to the stand.
3,0,0,Your priors make things a bit tricky, but this is a clear case of tortious interference with trade.
4,1,1,I thought I told you to put on a suit and tie.
3,1,1,Juror number three is pro life.
3,0,0,I said dress appropriately... You have killer written all over you!
3,1,0,We've discussed this already, that would be considered Jury tampering.
3,0,0,I don't think the jury is buying that the scythe belonged to "a friend".
2,2,0,So you say that your career interests have led you to seek a spot on death row?
2,0,0,I doubt that postponing the execution in your case will help.
4,0,0,You can always take the 5th.
12,1,1,Don't worry, it's a jury of your teenage peers.
2,0,0,You have no standing in a right to life case.
3,2,1,Could you stop glancing at the judge and then checking your watch? It's not helping us.
2,0,0,You are the last client I will take on before my retirement.
9,1,0,So - you're saying Ingmar Bergman can vouch that you were on the beach on the day in question?
2,2,0,What do you mean you can't do life?
10,1,1,I hear the jury is pro-life.
3,1,0,No... I'm afraid it's life... without parole!
2,1,0,The vows clearly said you can just leave.
3,0,0,I won't lie to you but it's looking pretty grim.
3,1,0,You should be happy the charges were reduced to manslaughter.
2,2,0,You're being charged with 100 billion murders.
2,0,0,How do you feel about a life sentence?
3,0,0,I think I can plea this down to 1,000,0000,0000,000 years.
3,1,0,No, I don't think carrying out the death penalty will be part of your community service.
2,0,0,Our empty suit approach seems to work.
3,1,0,A hoodie! Couldn't you wear something else?
2,2,0,You're in luck--all their witnesses have mysteriously died.
6,1,1,Remember, I'll do the talking.
3,0,1,Yes, I do see the irony of having to appear in tax court.
3,0,0,They're charging you on a 100 billion counts
3,0,0,Keep it on, they won’t look at you as a terrorist.
3,0,0,No I don't think "Self Defence" would be a good angle.
4,2,1,It seems all witnesses for the prosecution have recently suffered fatal accidents.
2,2,0,And why, exactly, should we appeal the death penalty?
2,2,0,Well, looks like you're getting life.
2,0,0,Now don't forget to shake hands with the prosecutor.
3,0,0,Good news. Charges are being dropped for all crimes that took place before the 15th century.
2,0,0,Just doesn't work without the scythe.
2,0,0,Okay, you can take the stand, but don't talk them to death!
3,1,0,You should be more worried about the tax evasion charge.
3,1,1,We won't settle. They can't leverage the death penalty.
3,0,0,Fortunately they don't have your fingerprints
2,0,0,You'd already sold the scythe on Kijiji, right?
3,0,0,Uh, what are you doing here?
3,0,0,So we have to convince the state you are neither cruel nor particularly unusual.
2,3,0,I agree, speaking in public is scarier than death
7,2,0,If convicted, the penalty is death which, in your case, would be moot.
3,1,0,You got anything in there that could pass for charm? The jury hates you.
3,0,0,You know, you're really not making my job easier with this routine, Mr. Shkreli." "I plead the 5th.
2,0,0,Grin what?
3,0,0,So... Who handles it if you get the death penalty?
5,3,1,Yes, you are death. But the IRS is going to argue you still have to pay your taxes.
2,0,0,Should I plead "not guilty"?
2,0,0,Actually, in this jurisdiction, it's the judge's responsibility to issue the death sentence.
3,0,0,We're going to tell the court you weren't there.
4,0,0,A plea bargain?
2,0,0,Not to worry", it's called double indemnity.
3,1,1,Given the number of victims, I don't think we can expect much leniency.
3,0,0,Let's hope they can't find the Scythe.
2,0,0,The verdict could be grim.
4,0,0,Stop saying you want a 'hung' jury.
2,0,0,I don't see any peers in the jury pool.
2,0,0,I'll do my best, but you may be looking at life.
3,1,0,We'll argue the death penalty is a conflict of interest.
3,0,0,Are those Warby Parker glasses? I want to get a pair soon too
2,0,0,If we plea bargain now I can get you life.
3,0,0,Are you sure you've told me everything...?
3,0,0,So you say you were with Scrooge at the time?
3,1,0,I'm not sure that your claim that you are the Grim Reaper is going to clear you of a murder one charge.
3,0,0,I have a feeling you're losing confidence in me.
3,1,1,I just want to confirm - You only came to me because you need a lawyer.
3,0,0,so, in this case, the prosecutor is willing to make a plea bargain.
3,1,0,Look. Accepting payment obligates you to transport.
2,0,0,'Tag, you're it' is not a very good defense.
3,0,0,No, I'm sorry this is not a death penalty state.
2,0,0,Under no circumstances are you to breath on me.
3,1,0,There's not much we can do. You were clocked going 90.
3,0,1,Relax. I specialize in getting my clients the death penalty.
2,0,0,Let me show you how a real soul-sucking job is done.
3,0,0,I think you will get life.
3,1,0,No, Grim, I told you - you're just a humble farmer. The sickle had beat juice on it.
3,1,0,I know you're trying to make a point here, but we really should have settled out of court.
2,0,0,Yes, I suppose you would like to see a hung jury.
3,1,0,It's going to look like you don't want to face your accuser!
2,0,0,It might help if you smiled at the jury.
3,1,1,Your Honor, my client utilizes an agricultural hand tool, professionally.
2,2,0,Relax. You look nothing like the police sketch.
3,1,1,Don't worry, I think I can get you the death penalty.
3,0,0,No offense, but I can make a very strong anti-death penalty case for you.
2,0,0,We're going to ask that your prior record be ruled inadmissible.
2,0,0,Better let me do all the talking
5,0,4,If asked, you used the scythe for harvesting wheat.
2,0,0,They can't make the terrorism charges stick.
3,1,0,Could you try looking a little less grim?
2,2,0,You know, this time, it's not your place to judge.
3,1,0,Just remember. We're pleading ex post facto.
6,1,0,Yeah, I can move for a change of venue but to where?
3,0,0,Look, on New Year's Eve with everyone celebrating, a sickle is a dangerous weapon!
3,1,0,Don't worry. All they care about is the Panama accounts.
6,0,0,This is New York; they abolished the death penalty.
3,1,0,The DA says he won't plea bargain with death.
3,0,1,We cop a plea, I'll get you life.
2,0,0,I don't think " He was just doing his job" will cut it with this jury.
2,0,0,We'll prove the Grand Jury your actions were perfectly commensurate with your duties...
12,0,0,Are you listening to what I am saying?
3,0,0,I don't believe that the Uniform Code of Grim Reaper Conduct is recognized in this jurisdiction.
3,1,0,The prosecution took the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,Not to worry. Celebrity defendants never get convicted.
2,2,0,Remember, don't approach the bench.
3,0,0,Let's face it ... never mind.
3,1,0,Remember, keep your answers short and I'll lighten things up on redirect.
2,2,0,So we'll petition the court to vacate the ruling.
2,0,0,It doesn't send a good message to the jury that you're embarrassed to be my lawyer.
4,1,2,Bergman still won't settle - insists you're 'public domain'.
2,0,0,You need to go now, the Death penalty is off the table.
2,2,0,The brothers will accept $50,000 and you agree to be called simply "The Reaper" from now on.
2,2,0,Just doing your job, right?
3,1,0,The judge denied your Writ of Habeas Corpse
3,1,0,Would it kill you to lose the hoodie?
3,0,0,I'm going to ask that you pay my bill before you testify.
2,0,0,It's going to be hard to find an unbiased jury.
3,1,0,"This is not going well".
2,1,0,For the last time, stop referring to the jury as a "death panel."
4,1,2,Court's split 4-4. You don't look surprised.
2,0,0,Hang on, I've got a killer objection to make.
5,0,0,I'm glad you took my advice to leave the scythe at home.
3,0,0,Ironically, the death penalty is still in the table
3,0,0,And finally, try to smile at the jury.
2,0,0,I made you a killer deal.
2,2,0,The worst they can give you is life.
9,1,0,Can I tell the jury that you are willing to commute their death sentence.
4,1,0,Not a problem. Your scythe tested clean.
2,0,0,If you get the death penalty, don't laugh.
3,0,1,Would it have killed you to put on a tie?
2,0,0,as your attorney, i advise... never mind.
2,0,0,Witnesses! That's what this case is missing and that's why we're going to win!
3,1,0,Now you'll have to show a face to the case.
3,0,0,Maybe you should look in the mirror. The death penalty looks inevitable in this case.
2,0,0,We have a good judge. The tax collector just got off.
5,0,0,Mr. Reaper. This is a court room. Yes, justice and truth were the first victims. However, threatening the judge with the fires from hell and eternal damnation will not help your case.
3,0,0,My life is on the line here. Don't you make any self-incriminating statements.
2,4,0,You don't agree with a stay of execution?
2,0,0,I know you made a career change, but reaping someone else's crops is still considered theft.
3,1,0,Keep a poker face, the jury will be watching.
3,1,0,I can't touch that Bible. You know that, right?
3,1,0,Between you and me, it's hard defending someone who brings a scythe into the courtroom...
6,0,0,By showing remorse, we can avoid the death penalty.
3,0,0,You may be my Ghost Writer, but I'll telling the truth!
2,0,0,Chances
2,0,0,For the last time, we're not calling Blue Oyster Cult as a character witness!
2,0,0,I've got to warn you... hoodies don't usually go over well here.
2,0,0,How about we file for a writ of habeas corpus?
3,0,0,There's no way I'm putting you on the stand.
6,0,0,Don't be so grim, I still have two more kids to put through College
3,1,0,Do you appreciate the irony of my plea bargaining in exchange for 'life'?
4,0,0,I think maybe we should consider the pleas bargain.
3,1,1,Look, the most important thing is that you not lose face.
3,1,0,Yes, I suppose the death penalty would be redundant.
3,1,0,They want to know if Grim Reaper is an alias?
3,0,0,We're done for. They found evidence of your involvement with GMO distribution.
3,0,0,Sometimes, it is like looking in a mirror
3,0,0,You're lucky they abolished the death penalty in this state.
2,0,0,You mean you are not Mark Zuckerberg?
3,0,0,I think you should lower the hood. We want to convey sincerity.
2,0,0,I just don't think pleading the 5th is going to work here...
2,0,0,Now remember, it's because you were wearing a hoodie.
12,1,0,Think of it this way, encountering juror bias is not unusual, but simply a matter of degree. In some cases, like yours, it just seems to be a tad more pronounced.
3,0,0,I'm sorry, but the death penalty was abolished here in 1965.
2,0,0,Will you have to recuse yourself because of my brush with death?
3,1,0,Sorry, "It was their time" is not a valid defense.
3,0,0,The good news is the prosecutor is taking the You Penalty off the table.
2,0,0,Enough with the dead lawyer jokes.
3,0,0,I definitely think that removing your hood will improve our case.
4,0,0,Have you ever worked on a capital punishment case before?
4,0,0,Ok, so we agree that our strategy is to get the death penalty off the table.
4,0,1,I'll assume you will be seeking the death penalty.
3,0,1,It's an all white jury. Lose the hoodie.
2,0,0,Sorry, but I don't think we can ask for the death penalty in a bankruptcy case.
3,0,0,No, Silly, this is not a death penalty case. It's about the scheduling of the TV show "lucifer."
12,0,0,I would prefer to go to hell. My wife is already in heaven
2,1,0,Good news is the EMTs brought your victim back, so the charge is reduced from first degree murder to attempted murder. Bad news is with your prior record, you're looking at a pretty stiff sentence.
3,0,0,Insanity is okay, but inevitability will get you life.
2,0,0,You may have dressed for the occasion.
3,0,1,Try not to point at this new judge.
2,0,0,OK, with the next witness, please say "I'll see you later" with a bit less enthusiasm.
3,1,0,In your case the death penalty is beyond ironic.
2,2,0,I will try to get them to call you just Mr. Reaper.
3,0,0,Does that hoodie come in blue?
3,1,1,We plead not guilty on the grounds of mistaken identity
2,0,0,I told you, I got a very good feeling about this. I mean, you look just like death warmed over.
3,1,0,But really, would the death sentence be so bad?
2,0,0,They have never had someone ask for the death penalty before.
2,0,0,Your wife will drop all charges if you continue to have no contact with her.
2,0,0,Let me understand this, you want to remain faceless in you eye witness testimony?
3,1,0,I told you this job was soul-sucking.
4,0,0,I don't think wearing a conservative suit and tie would have killed you… You know what I mean.
2,0,0,I find your argument to be somewhere between rather grim and somewhat empty.
4,0,0,I am sorry, but it is hard to come up with a defense when you are wanted everywhere for manslaughter.
2,0,0,I told you the scythe wouldn't get through the metal detector.
4,2,0,I'm feeling good about a hung jury!
2,0,0,I appreciate your efforts but I've decided to represent myself.
3,4,4,The judge has disappeared. Anything you want to tell me?
2,0,0,Here comes the jury. Put on your best face.
2,0,0,Don't answer that, you risk life!
2,1,0,A suit and tie wouldn't kill you.
3,2,1,Frankly, the hoodie isn't helping.
2,0,0,your community service has been taken into consideration.
2,0,0,It might make you feel better if you just play along.
6,1,0,You understand what I mean when I say 'a hung jury would be a great outcome for us,' right?
2,0,0,Okay, you know you're supposed to plead the Fifth, right?
2,0,0,I do believe I'm having a near-death experience.
2,0,0,You're off the hook if you get the death penalty Joking aside!
3,1,0,Well, it's better than yesterday's SS uniform.
3,1,0,No matter how many souls you've already taken-- deny, deny, deny, & plead "not guilty."
3,1,0,Gee Rob, I'm glad it's not your sense of humor that's on trial here.
5,0,0,If you get too close to the judge up there, expecto some major patronum.
3,0,0,Honestly, I don't think anyone will believe she broke the infidelity clause.
2,2,0,I don't think we can plead lack of intent.
5,0,0,I think I love you, Harvey.
3,1,1,Don't worry. Without the scythe, they don't have a case.
2,0,0,You're the one that went with the Public Defender.
3,1,1,You realize you're getting life?
4,0,0,I’m sorry, I can’t object every time someone implies that murder is bad.
3,1,0,Don't worry. The life penalty is not legal in this state.
3,3,1,Remember, a smile goes a long way.
3,0,0,Surely you'll get something less than the death penalty."
2,0,0,you'l have to get a suit, only the judge can wear a robe in court
3,0,0,Just keep that sweet, innocent look.
3,0,0,Whatever the verdict, know that I'm honored to have represented the most prolific serial killer of all time.
2,0,0,I'm pleading occupational hazard.
3,2,2,Stop looking so happy when they discuss a possible death sentence.
3,2,0,To be honest, I'd be surprised if you get life.
3,1,0,I'd actually recommend not making eye contact.
3,0,0,I think the jury can see right through your argument.
6,0,0,The appeal is not going well either?
2,4,0,I know you're experienced, but I'll do the closing.
2,0,0,You know, in most cases the petition for clemency is made before the execution
4,1,0,Legally, doing every other death ever doesn't mean you did this one.
5,0,0,What do you mean, not guilty!? I thought I was being sentenced to life!
3,0,0,You've got nothing to hide.
3,0,0,You could be facing the death penalty--if you had a face.
3,1,0,Does my elbow touching your elbow count as me being dead?
2,0,0,Halloween is tomorrow
2,0,0,Never mind taking the fifth. Just keep answering "NEVERMORE". A dozen of those and they will be eager for you to leave.
2,2,0,You have the right to remain deathly silent.
3,3,1,Hey one to two millennia beats life.
2,0,0,Don't worry. Even if we lose, you can just slip right out of the cell.
2,0,0,If only you'd had a license to scythe
2,0,0,Remember! You were just following orders!
2,0,0,Unfortunately, it turns out the saying is correct. Taxes are as certain as you are.
3,1,1,Our goal here today is to remind the jury that you are just the messenger and guide - not the perpetrator.
5,0,0,So you're asking me to convince the jury that your cashmere hoodie is at the cleaners?
4,0,0,Keep it out of sight unless one of their witnesses starts lying.
3,3,1,If it's a life sentence, we'll appeal.
2,1,1,I'm afraid it looks grim...
3,0,1,Please stop looking that way towards the jurors.
5,2,0,That's not exactly what I had in mind when I said to wear a killer outfit.
3,4,1,We're losing pretty badly so far. Can you...you know...'visit' a couple of the jurors?
3,0,0,We've already set one precedent. We now have a strong case to set a second one and win your tax appeal.
3,1,0,I know you don't do bargains but would you make an exception for this plea?
13,0,0,Seeing as how this is a wrongful death case, I thought that perhaps I should give the closing argument this time..
3,0,0,.. and your telling me THIS now?!?
3,2,0,This is your first offense, right?
3,0,0,The judge would like you to stop "dismissing" jurors
2,0,0,From what I've gathered, you're already serving multiple life sentences - what's one more.
3,1,0,Well at least death is off the table.
2,2,0,I know you feel cheated, but this is a good deal.
3,1,0,Of course, you are aware of the what the maximum penalty would be.
2,0,0,What do you mean you don't think your ready
3,1,0,Your Honor, Death pleads Guilty to tax evasion.
2,0,0,Don't mention The Maiden.
3,0,0,It doesn't matter if it's ten lifetimes, you can wait.
3,0,0,They are not accepting your plea that you just lost your head.
2,0,0,Here's the problem. You have a really bad reputation.
3,0,0,We'll plead not guilty by reason of mortality.
3,0,0,You should have gotten a Concealed Scythe Permit.
2,0,0,Sorry, there is no 5th Amendment protection equivalent based on how you look!
3,1,1,When I asked if you had a dark suit, this isn't what I meant.
3,0,0,This isn't going to be easy--you're a repeat offender.
3,4,1,Can anyone testify you sent them to a better place?
3,0,0,I think you should make the final statement.
2,2,0,Is that your only suit?
4,2,2,Try not to show any emotion when the verdict is read.
3,1,0,Wouldn't you rather take the penalty that's named after you?
3,1,0,I know you are homesick, but you can't get the death penalty for speeding!
3,1,0,I've researched your case thoroughly and find that I can no longer defend your actions.
7,0,0,Don't worry. This judge doesn't believe in the death penalty.
3,0,1,They're offering you life, but we can probably talk them up from there.
3,1,0,In this case, the death penalty is basically just house arrest.
2,0,0,To gain the jury's approval, I strongly advise you to take a holiday.
3,1,0,Just to make sure I understand you, are you hoping the jury reached a Death Penalty verdict?
2,0,0,No Hoodies in the court room
7,1,0,Remind me again - which one of us is the lawyer?
3,0,0,You're being charged with a faceless crime.
4,0,0,You've never before had a restraining order?
2,0,0,Did you kill this man?
2,0,0,Mr. Reaper, I think it's advisable to start wearing a suit to these proceedings.
2,2,0,I think your Facebook profile is going to hurt us.
3,2,0,What are you pleading? Not guilty or not here?
3,0,0,Are you sure a quote from Thanatopsis is an appropriate response?
3,0,0,I suggest we go with the 'act of God' defence.
6,4,1,If the Scythe doesn't fit they have to acquit...
2,0,0,When you say "spook the jurors", what does that mean?
3,2,1,Our best bet is to try to get your sentences to run concurrently.
2,0,0,Yes, they are seeking the Death Penalty and no, I don't think we need to worry.
4,1,2,Think of the irony if they give you life.
3,1,0,Trust me: You'll kill up there.
2,0,0,At this point the pale horse wouldn't hurt your case.
2,0,0,Yes, you can testify on your own behalf. But only as a last resort!
2,4,0,Please stop saying you'll take the ME penalty.
3,1,0,Well, I guess the death penalty is off the table.
2,0,0,Of course you want a hung jury.
5,0,0,It's 2016. They're a protected class. You should have known better.
4,0,0,Stop interrupting me with your brainwaves.
2,2,0,Maybe the police planted the scythe.
3,0,1,We actually GO for the death penalty--then double jeopardy on appeal. Agreed?
8,0,0,You have a great prima facie case for your identity theft.
3,0,1,Jumping the gun a little, aren't you?
3,0,1,The judge may ask you to take your hood off, but don't.
3,3,1,So your explanation is that they were dead when you got there...
2,0,0,The clothes make it difficult to argue that you're not cruel and unusual.
2,0,0,Let's try for a plea devil's bargain.
7,1,0,Remember: deny everything.
3,0,0,You're looking pretty fly.
3,1,0,Death was the best I could do but I thought you'd be ok with that.
3,0,0,No, rigor mortis is NOT covered under habeas corpus.
4,0,0,You tell the judge to go to hell!
2,0,0,But you told me to come dressed to kill.
2,0,0,Here again.
3,2,2,...and stop staring at the jury. It's intimidating.
3,2,0,No, I don't think calling The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as character witnesses is a good idea.
2,2,0,It's not genocide if you killed without regard to race, creed or color.
2,0,0,As your lawyer I must advise you not to kill anyone during the lunch break.
2,0,0,What did you expect, wearing a black hoodie in that neighborhood?
3,1,0,Frankly, you've got the face of a killer.
2,2,0,Our strategy is simple-- go for the death penalty.
2,0,0,You are sure to win, it's a tax case.
3,0,1,That special place for lawyers--I don't go there, right?
2,0,0,What do you mean - it's a cold case?
3,1,0,It would really help if you lost the hoodie.
2,0,0,I can't stop them from referring to it as a penalty.
2,0,0,Attorney, too? Judge, jury, and executioner weren't enough?
2,2,0,I think we'll be able to avoid a life sentence.
2,0,0,I know I'm the best defense attorney in the country....but would it kill you to try looking a little more life affirming?
2,0,0,If it doesn't fit, you must acquit. Right?
2,2,0,I'm afraid they may sentence you to life.
2,0,0,I'll give you $10,000 if you read off this pad and whisper something in my ear during the trial.
4,1,2,Relax, try not to look so grim.
2,0,0,Don't worry, they've abolished the death penalty.
2,0,0,What's an appeal? Well...
3,0,0,Unless we can turn the tide, a life sentence is the best you're gonna get.
2,0,0,We like this judge. Let me do the sidebars, okay?
2,2,0,The good news is they've agreed to have your 11 billion life sentences run concurrently.
3,1,0,You may get life for killing that chess player.
2,0,0,Try not to make eye contact with the jury.
5,3,1,Look at the bright side, you might get life.
4,0,0,Seriously, ditch the hoodie for a suit and tie.
2,2,0,Relax. Without the scythe, they haven't got a prayer.
3,0,0,You're facing the death penalty.
3,0,0,No, do not show them your scythe!
2,0,0,Remember - don't take your scythe to the stand.
2,0,0,Listen....I was just doing my job is not a defense.
4,0,0,Don't look at me like that.
3,0,0,"Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six? The irony is devastating.
3,0,1,I think we have to drop the self-defense plea.
4,0,0,When the judge says something you disagree with, try to not point at him ominously.
3,0,0,I'm afraid that's the sentence, death.
3,0,0,I just got word that Brad Pitt wants to play you in the movie.
3,0,0,I think we can plea it down to a lie sentence.
3,0,0,I've heard of jury nullification, but this is ridiculous.
2,3,0,Joint custody is off the table.
3,4,2,I'm assuming that you'll be fine with the death penalty.
4,1,0,They're going to have a devil of a time making a positive ID.
6,0,0,Next the prosecution is going to ask about discovery.
2,0,0,He's sentencing you to life
2,0,0,The jugge just reminded us that no hoodies are allowed in the courtroom.
4,0,0,Should I offer them to settle this over a game of chess?
3,1,0,Why so grim? They gave you life.
3,0,0,When you get up there try to look friendly and non-threatening.
3,0,0,Wear the Gap hoodie tomorrow.
2,0,0,Bad news. You got life.
3,1,0,I suggest you take the Fifth.
2,0,0,He hit me first
7,1,0,You didnt tell me you were in the 'hood
3,1,0,In my youth "The Invisible Man " was wrapped in bandages!!!!!
2,0,0,We're going to claim that Obamacare is an undue burden on your livelihood.
3,0,0,We have an air-tight defense--use of the scythe is protected by the Second Amendment.
3,1,0,Consider yourself dead
2,0,0,The IRS isn't ready to release you from your tax liability.
3,0,0,I know you had your heart set on the kids...
3,0,0,Actually, I do identify with you in a Millennial sort of way...
3,0,1,You're not proud, are you?
2,0,0,I’m pretty sure the judge will be inclined to split the baby. Literally.
3,0,1,Oh man, you smell like... forget it.
4,1,0,I think we should plead insanity
2,0,0,We'll use that population-control argument if we have to. But first, let's try to scare off a few witnesses.
2,0,0,Trust me, he won't hold you in contempt.
5,0,0,I declined the plea bargain. Let's hope you get the chair.
2,4,0,The first thing they will try to do is find a jury of your peers.
6,1,0,It doesn't look good. They found your scythe.
4,1,2,Trust me; she'll get custody.
3,2,0,We're going to go with an identity theft defense.
3,1,1,"You're going to get the life penalty".
2,0,0,When I told you to drop the black robe, I didn't mean you should wear polka dots instead.
3,0,0,The Grim Reaper defense won't work in your case.
3,0,0,Not only you should take the fifth, but all twelve of them.
4,2,3,I'm a lawyer...I sold my soul a long time ago.
4,1,0,Remember, you're to say that you were on holiday.
2,2,0,Try not to look so guilty.
3,1,0,I wont lie to you..things look pretty grim. Do you have something else you could wear to court?
3,0,0,I think our best shot here is to plead guilty.
7,0,0,Frankly,the gangsta hoodie routine isn't helping your image.
2,3,0,It's a death penalty case. You win either way.
5,0,0,Habeas corpus won't be a problem.
12,0,0,No, this is not a death penalty case either.
3,0,0,This is a contract case--we can't ask for the death penalty.
3,0,1,You could get life, but you don't want that, do you?
2,0,0,Here's the good news: you got the death penalty.
4,0,0,Am I representing you? Or, are you representing me?
2,2,0,Apparently your scythe is not deductible.
2,2,0,Remember, if they ask about the Black Plague, plead the Fifth.
2,3,0,Don't complicate this by giving them the death stare.
3,1,0,Death penalty. Didn't see that one coming'.
3,0,1,Here we are... Death and Taxes
2,0,0,I'm going to ask for habeas corpus.
3,0,1,So you want our plea bargain to be that you'll accept a death sentence?
3,0,0,Three parking tickets, really?
2,0,0,Nothing is that grim.
2,2,0,Well, what kind of penalty did you expect?
4,2,3,Mr. Reaper, I'm afraid that "It was his time to go" is not a legal defense.
3,0,0,The verdict is self-imposed punishment.
3,0,0,It's not the death thing, it's the hoodie thing.
3,0,0,I suggest we both waive our fees.
2,2,0,Before you get all excited, that's not what a "hung jury" means.
3,0,0,Remember. Project a positive image for the jury.
2,0,0,So you're missing Trump's IQ gene...
3,0,1,No, getting the death penalty is not a good thing.
9,3,2,Yes, but Johnnie Cochran's not around any more. And whose fault is that?
3,1,0,Looks like you're getting You
2,2,0,I don't think they believe this was your first offense.
2,0,0,If your willing to remove the cloak I may be able to get you parolled in a few weeks based on time served.
3,0,1,I think we should ask for the death penalty
6,1,0,Why aren't you wearing the glasses I got you?
3,0,0,Three words: Failure. To. Appear.
2,2,0,We will maintain that this is a case of mistaken identity.
6,1,0,We're gonna get him. I won't see you cheated again.
3,0,1,Just let me do the talking.
3,2,1,Ironically, you've been given life.
3,1,0,I came to take your life.
3,0,0,A little smile for the jury please Reappie.
3,0,0,Don't complain. With good behavior you'll be out in one lifetime.
2,2,0,As your attorney, I advise you to keep the hood on.
2,2,0,The hood's ok, but you'll have to take the sunglasses off.
2,0,0,In my 20 years of litigation you're my first client who WANTS the death penalty.
3,1,0,With all due respect, it's not exactly my fault that Johnnie Cochran was unavailable.
7,1,0,I'm not sure that telling the judge to "go to hell" is exactly our best defense.
2,0,0,If you plead innocent, you might get the death penalty.
3,0,1,Whatever you do, don't look at the jury.
3,2,0,I advise you to take the 5th, as well as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th.
2,0,0,Fake like your devastated if the judge sentences you to death.
2,2,0,They are going to ask you why the email server was in your basement.
4,1,0,Come to think of it glasses might soften your image.
3,1,0,They're saying he bought the super size soda from a machine not a restaurant so we may not need you here.
4,0,1,You'll get off no problem- I was on O.J.'s defense team.
3,0,0,We can ask for the death penalty but I can promise we'll get it.
3,0,0,I am afraid the brief I am submitting is a bit grim. I hope my brief is not too grim.
3,0,1,They can prove you're responsible for multiple deaths.
3,1,0,I am sure the scythe is fine, just keep track of your claim ticket.
6,0,0,It's a clear case of mistaken identity. The prosecution allege their client was assaulted by nine men seeking his "precious".
3,1,0,It looks bad for you, but at least the Death Penalty is off the table
4,0,0,When you take the stand next time, stop trying to be funny.
4,0,1,You're looking at 100 billion counts, but I'm pretty sure I can get the Hitler charge dropped.
5,0,0,Fine, pro bono. But for the record, we DO have a soul.
2,0,0,I am too busy to die move on
2,0,0,we just have to convince them that it's your job
3,1,0,Just need to make sure we agree on what we mean by jury 'selection' . . .
3,0,0,I know you're "just not another pretty face" but prove it to the jury...
2,2,0,Don't worry, you have a solid alibi. Someone else somewhere died at the same time as this victim.
2,0,0,Remember the worst they can give you is death, wait that's the bare minimum for you.
3,2,0,Lucky for you, it's a hung jury.
5,0,1,I hear orange is the new black
3,1,0,I think you should pick the jury.
7,4,0,It looks pretty grim.
4,2,0,Trust me; they haven't got a ghost of a chance.
3,2,0,Lucky for you everyone's wearing them.
6,0,0,There IS a difference between natural death and murder.
2,0,0,Good, with out the Sickle I think we stand a better chance.
4,1,0,Don't worry, this state still has the death penalty.
2,2,0,Santa Claus I could get off. You, not so much.
3,0,0,That's not what Jury nullification means.
2,2,0,Next time wear a tie.
3,1,0,Its true people can't cheat you, but corporations can.
3,0,0,Sorry, Senator Wasserman there simply is no affirmative defense for the alleged charges of rape in 1st-20th degree of the DNC stewardship of the 2016 Democratic nomination! process!
2,0,0,Don't be so gloomy, you'll scare the jury
3,0,0,For the last time, your plea is guilty! Being ripped off by your wireless provider is no excuse for murder.
2,0,0,We're going for a mistrial, you didn't rape, you reaped.
6,1,0,There is no prima facie evidence.
2,2,0,Trust me, the scythe wouldn't have played well with this jury.
2,2,0,It doesn't matter if it is for your job, no contact means no contact.
2,0,0,I told you to lose the hoodie It screams guilty.
3,0,0,A writ of Habeas Corpus may be a little insensitive right now.
3,2,1,I'll simply explain you were just doing your job.
3,0,0,I may actually put you on the stand.
2,0,0,The prosecution wants the you penalty
2,0,0,I try and get you life.
3,1,0,You can't keep doing that to the jury!
2,0,0,We appreciate your fraternal instincts, but we've got this case covered.
2,0,0,Don’t look so grim, the verdict isn’t in.
2,0,0,I told you not to show your face around here!
2,0,0,Yes, I see the irony.
3,0,0,You're on trial for plagiarism—and stop stealing your case files.
4,0,2,You can't ask for the death penalty instead of paying your parking tickets.
3,1,0,As your tax attorney, I hope to subtract one item from that so called two-things-for-certain list.
2,0,0,Well, at least it wasn't the death penalty.
2,2,0,How do you even get ticketed on the Highway to Hell?
4,0,0,Residuals -including international- we aren't settling for less.
3,0,0,Fortunately this state doesn't have a you penalty.
5,0,0,I think our best strategy at this point would be for you to casually put your hand on the prosecutor's shoulder.
2,0,0,How can I explain to the Court that you're from the other side?
4,0,0,This is not going to be easy.
2,0,0,I defended Taxes and let's just say you should take the deal.
2,0,0,Good news: judge is throwing out the line up ID.
3,0,1,When you told me you wanted to file for divorce, I didn't realize she literally sucked the life out of you.
3,1,0,You should have appealed earlier.
3,1,0,I really wish you wouldn't take the phrase "face your accuser" so personally.
4,0,2,Remember: The Devil Made You Do It.
8,1,0,The D.A. is asking for life.
3,1,0,I wasn't able to locate any of your alibis.
3,0,0,There's a reason that this is a hoodie-free zone Tyrone.
3,1,1,Don't worry, you said they didn't get a good look at your face.
4,0,0,We've got them on occupational profiling.
3,1,0,So I told him, 'Not til Hell Freezes Over!'
2,0,0,I don't think the jury is buying into the domestic abuse defense.
5,2,0,Why yes, I do see you getting life without parole as being rather ironic
3,0,0,Don't worry... They didn't have the heart to seek the life penalty.
2,0,0,I am NOT Eddie Rickenbacker; I am your lawyer!
3,0,1,I like that I'm not the most unpopular person in the courtroom for once.
2,0,0,I had nothing to wear and nowhere to hide.
2,0,0,You don't get a jury of your exact peers.
4,0,0,I did suggest that wearing a suit would make you look less guilty to the jury.
3,1,0,If you agree with the involuntary manslaughter plea, nod your hood.
3,1,0,I hate to say this, but we're probably looking at the death penalty.
2,0,0,Self-defense may be a problem.
3,1,0,I have to be honest, there's a very good chance you could get the dea... the you penalty.
2,0,0,I think our best strategy is to argue that you were just the messenger.
3,1,1,If the prosecutor asks you to state your name, just plead the Fifth.
3,0,0,They're giving you a penalty, Death.
3,0,0,...and I don't want to hear your version of Dry Bones when you're on the stand.
5,0,0,This is not the time for hide and seek!!
3,0,0,Would I have gotten a better lawyer if I had paid more?
3,0,0,My fee is contingent.
8,0,0,Remember to make eye contact - it's important they see you as a human being.
3,0,0,Relax… a death sentence gets your released on your own recognizance.
3,1,0,Don't forget, don't smile at the jury!
3,1,0,I suppose that an appeal is unlikely.
2,3,0,This would be a good time to look every juror in the eye.
3,0,0,Plead the scythe.
3,0,0,Be not proud.
2,1,0,I told you, no hoodies.
3,2,1,In your case, you could get life.
3,0,0,The judge doesn't think you have sufficient grounds for habeas corpus since the court is not holding your body in custody.
2,0,0,Forget the Jury. I'll talk them to death.
2,0,0,I realize she wouldn't stop for you, but that doesn't mean that if you kindly stop for her you aren't violating a traffic law.
3,0,0,I'm afraid the witness just described the assailant as having hollow cheeks.
2,0,0,You're up. Look alive.
3,0,1,The judge is asking for continuance again. Looks like another set of jury members died of "natural causes" last night.
5,0,0,Good thing is you're not charged with murder
2,2,0,So you'll plead if you can get the death penalty?
3,1,0,Try to connect with the jury.
3,3,1,Get serious; you're up against the IRS. Take the deal.
2,0,0,The Image Consultant said we should have gone with a blue oxford.
4,0,1,File a motion to kill this next witness.
3,0,0,Next time you identify someone, don't point, just nod your head
2,2,0,The judge strikes the jurors, not you.
2,0,0,Do you care if the prosecutor is seeking the death penalty?
3,2,2,They'll let you walk if you testify against the other horsemen.
2,0,0,Listen, I have to level with you. I'm not accredited.
3,1,0,Death....you need to take the stand....You are facing life.
3,0,0,If only I could get a sign... any kind of sign.
5,2,0,Your win would be my loss.
2,0,0,Must be nice to be able to bill in eons.
3,1,0,Remember, you were just the lackey who delivered fresh souls to Satan. Eternal damnation was his idea.
2,2,0,Honestly, I don't think that you should testify.
2,0,0,Do you vape?
2,0,0,Sorry, Death. Looks like you might be facing yourself.
3,0,0,You're the client but, in my opinion, wailing "your time is coming" to the judge is not a winning defense strategy.
3,0,0,You should have declared your stock income.
2,0,0,I strongly advise we go for the death penalty.
3,1,0,Let me get this right....you WANT the death penalty?
3,1,0,Worst case scenario eternity without parole.
2,0,0,That could be anyone in a black hoodie.
5,0,0,The death penalty suits you.
3,0,0,Our case is built upon the premise the jury will take you at face value, you'll have to get rid of the hoodie.
3,0,0,Ironically, you'll probably get life.
2,0,0,The judge says for you to habeas corpus and be quick about it.
3,0,0,Are you sure you want to take the stand?
2,0,0,With any luck, we'll get you life.
5,0,0,I just noticed: there's nothing in your black hole.
3,1,0,They have you dead to rights, I'll see if we can settle.
4,0,0,Don't let her rattle you.
3,2,0,I don't think you have to worry, they have taken the death penalty off the table.
2,0,0,I told you to wear a suit and tie--not a Halloween custome.
4,0,0,I think it might be time to challenge them to a game a chess.
3,0,1,You"re late!
2,0,0,They need you to try on the gloves.
3,1,1,I know you killed him, but did you *kill him* kill him?
4,0,0,You won't be needed today, it's only traffic court.
2,0,0,I'm absolutely here for you.
4,1,2,It would have killed you to wear a suit?
3,2,1,Don't you have a nice blue suit?
4,0,2,So, I assume you want the death penalty.
3,0,1,Are you worried you will be or won't be sentenced to death?!
2,0,0,Just remember: you're a cowl. You've never been a hood.
3,1,1,Arguing against the death penalty does seem counterintuitive.
3,0,1,After everything, I can't believe they indicted you for tax fraud.
2,0,0,Sorry, but I really need Christmas Past on this case.
2,0,0,Sorry, your visitation rights are looking rather grim.
2,2,0,I get you the death penalty and you're complaining?
2,0,0,I'm quite sure you'll get life.
2,0,0,Please wait, system processing.
3,1,0,We think that your visitation rights should be limited.
2,0,0,Our prospects look grim Mr. Reaper...I don't think the jury is buying the 'Angel of Death/River Styx' defense.
3,0,1,Honestly, let me handle this.
4,0,0,Good news, I got a plea bargain to throw out the death penalty.
3,1,0,Relax, Christmas Past and Present have agreed to testify for you.
3,0,0,Ironically, You GOT life.
3,1,0,The outlook of your case is very grim.
2,0,0,It means produce the body, not bring him back from hell.
3,1,0,Remember, make eye contact with the jury and smile.
8,1,0,Keep your mouth shut and let me do all the talking.
2,0,0,I'd take the plea, the murder weapon was a scythe.
3,3,0,I may be going out on a limb here but I'm going to assume the death penalty won't be a major problem for you.
2,0,0,It's just a formality. You'll win in the end.
3,1,1,You could get life.
3,1,0,Yes, but yours is not a faceless crime in the traditional sense.
3,0,0,Shouting "Black Deaths Matter" will lose it all for us.
3,0,1,My affairs? Of course they're in order. Why do you ask?
2,2,0,I think if we can get the scythe thrown out we have a chance
3,2,1,The judge was lenient. You got the death penalty.
2,0,0,And no, you won't be testifying in your own defense.
3,0,0,Look into their eyes, with a confident smile.
2,0,0,Hung jury is not what you think it is.
3,0,0,Now remember -- jurors pay a lot of attention to body language, especially facial expression and eye movements.
4,0,0,I'm sure you get asked this all the time, but was Elvis really on the toilet when you got there?
7,0,0,I'm not sure "Everyone makes a mistake once in a while" is going to fly
2,0,0,You'll want to say you use the scythe as a weed eater.
2,2,0,Bad news, there's no death penalty in this state.
7,2,1,It's not the hoodie itself that I'm worried about.
3,0,0,In case anyone asks, I've never seen you before in my life.
3,0,0,I know I said this would be pro bono but your hands are making me feel anti bono
3,1,1,Luckily this jury is as pro death as they come.
2,0,0,Statute of Limitations.
3,0,0,Because you are already dead life in prison and lethal injection are not options. However, the judge may choose unlimited duration community service at a New Jersey toll booth.
3,0,0,Trying to save face for a faceless crime won't cut it with the jury.
3,1,0,The sythe's a prop, okay? I wasn't brandishing a weapon.
7,1,2,Yes, death is considered a penalty here.
3,1,0,I'm sorry you had to check your scythe but, trust me, it's for the best.
2,0,0,I advise you to take the Fifth.
4,0,0,My best guess is the plaintiff is either suicidal, or he's looking to recover enough to pay his medical expenses. Why else would he sue you for malpractice?"
2,0,0,If you were merely a witness to his death we could make a plea bargain, but his family is sure you did it. (edited)
2,0,0,Take the Fifth.
3,0,0,Remember, if it doesn't fit, they must acquit.
2,2,0,I'd lose the hood. Show them you've nothing to hide.
2,2,0,Avoid saying "dead right" and "dead wrong" when you are on the stand.
2,0,0,You do realize you look sketchy as heck?
2,2,0,We'll plead mitigating circumstances - you were just doing your job...
4,0,0,Just how many of these cases are there?
3,1,0,Your being here today will assure they can NOT positively identify you.
2,0,0,...but they've got nobody to carry out the death penalty.
5,0,0,I think your best shot is the Ingmar Bergman defense.
3,1,1,I'm certain, you will have to pay the taxes.
4,0,0,We have to establish a jury connection. What are you scared of?
2,0,0,Easier than getting OJ off.
2,0,0,You were just doing your job isn't going to cut it here.
2,0,0,Don't worry, you can do a twenty year sentence on your head.
3,0,1,You're black and wearing a hoodie -- you haven't got a chance of acquittal
2,2,0,On the bright side, you'll feel right at home on death row.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, but there's been a grave misunderstanding - a unanimous vote for death means you did NOT win.
3,0,0,[ahem] ...could you repeat that number again? You say that you are responsible for how many deaths?
3,1,0,This is why it's so hard to come for a lawyer.
3,1,0,You'd have had more luck if you'd gone with the plaid shirt and sport coat like I said.
2,0,0,'The prosecution wants the death penalty...'
3,0,0,The judge wants to plead with you.
3,0,0,Let's go over it again, we're trying to AVOID the death penalty.
3,0,0,I don't think they will identify you...
4,0,0,So then, where is thy sting?
3,1,1,Would you like a mint?
3,2,0,It's tricky--you might get the death penalty.
3,1,0,Okay tomorrow wear a 3 piece suit
3,1,0,I can try arguing self defense.
2,0,0,You ARE entitled to compensation for the unlawful use of the phrase 'Death' penalty.
5,0,0,Good news - we've got it down to 5,456,894,553 consequetive life sentences...
7,1,0,Just sit there and look innocent.
3,1,0,You look like murder.
3,1,1,That's not how jury nullification works.
2,0,0,They know they can't touch me.
3,1,0,Seriously? You want me to tell them you didn't reap the benefits?
3,1,1,You might like it on death row.
6,1,0,No. Look, it's a civil case--he doesn't get the death penalty if you win.
5,1,1,I think I can get them to take death off the table.
3,0,0,Here's the deal: You give them naming rights, they let you walk.
3,0,0,Would you go shake hands with the prosecutor?
4,0,0,Honestly, I don't think a reduced sentence for good behavior is in the cards.
7,0,0,I have to say- I know you said you were a CIA spook, but this is still a little startling.
3,1,0,The judge says it's the worst case of identity theft he's ever seen .
3,1,0,Sorry, forgeting to recycle isn't a capital offense yet.
3,1,0,Don't worry. There's no death penalty in this state.
3,1,0,I'm here for the hung jury.
2,2,0,Actually, a habeas corpus motion just might work.
2,0,0,My stylist told me to wear blue but I really think my signature color will play better with the jury
2,0,0,You can probably avoid the death penalty, but you'll have to plead insanity.
3,1,0,I'm glad you brought your game face.
3,1,0,You should take the deal
2,0,0,Would you take a life sentence?
3,0,0,Please stop touching the witnesses.
2,2,0,I'm not the one on trial here you know. I don't appreciate your attitude.
3,1,0,Life without parole seems more humane.
3,0,1,The DA assured me the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,1,There's justice then there's blind justice!
6,5,0,We have to play the 'troubled childhood' card.
3,0,0,Well, at least you don't have any priors... right?
2,2,0,I'm not gonna lie. The odds look pretty grim.
2,0,0,Don't worry. I selected jurors with teenagers who look just like you.
3,0,0,I know you invented it.
3,1,0,I'm confident the prosecution won't be able to positively identify you.
3,1,0,No! No! No! You are NOT starting with the same fan base as OJ!
3,0,1,Try to keep a straight face.
2,0,0,I thought I told you, evidence from face recognition software isn't admissible.
2,0,0,I'm afraid you'll have to agree to pay child support. Your wife appears to have no fear of death.
3,0,0,I Heard that the judge has a bad ticker
5,2,0,Relax--you know you'll never serve life.
2,5,0,Don't worry. You're going to kill in the cross examination.
2,0,0,Try to avoid too much "grimness" in your testimony.
3,0,1,Death be not proud. Let's settle.
2,0,0,Try to look alive on the stand.
3,2,1,Hung jury it is.
3,0,0,Fat chance. Her Honor leans toward Life without parole.
3,1,0,I don't think the jury will buy the self defense argument
3,1,0,It might help if you didn't say "Yes!" whenever the prosecution recommended the death penalty.
2,0,0,Did my assistant discuss with you how to dress at trial?
3,1,1,Don't worry—You'll fit right in on death row.
3,1,0,If you want a shot at winning this, you really should consider getting a new suit.
3,3,3,People have been cheating you for years, you're due compensation.
2,0,0,Tell the court that your job is to die for.
2,0,0,Any way you can lose the hoodie?
3,1,0,It wouldn’t hurt to smile a little when you testify.
3,2,1,They've asked you to take the death penalty off the table.
3,0,0,You're lucky, this state has no Death penalty.
2,0,0,I thought I told you to suit up!
3,0,0,Your business plan is sound.
3,0,0,This trial has become a real face-off.
2,5,1,You really gotta stop showing up at the scene of the crime.
3,0,0,Did you have to wear that hoodie today?
3,1,0,If things go wrong, you might get the you penalty.
2,0,0,Just be yourself - Death Eaters have rights too.
4,2,0,A lawyer can do just so much. You need an image consultant and a stylist.
2,0,0,Now that's how you present a case. It was a good day for the law firm of O'Malley, Goldstein & Reaper.
3,0,0,Look, I've already told you that we can't say you were "just helping him cross the rainbow bridge".
2,2,0,A 'hung jury' isn't what you think it means
3,0,0,With the plea bargain I can get you life.
2,0,0,The worst case scenario is a Life sentence.
6,1,0,I said dark coat, not dark cloak, Mr. Daggert.
3,0,0,"Not hung. I said we need a young jury." (italicize "hung" and "young")
3,0,0,Don't worry about losing face, just plead guilty!
5,0,0,Were you read your rites?
3,1,0,It's still considered a penalty in the eyes of the law.
7,0,0,Just promise me that you and your scythe will never again visit me in any way except for legal purposes and I will get you off.
2,0,0,The judge said that you have no appeal.
2,0,0,The outcome of this case might have been in your favor, had you just worn the blue suit.
3,1,0,The judge would like to hear your thoughts on the death penalty.
3,2,1,Thanks, but no. When I said we could use a hung jury, that's not what I meant.
3,1,0,You'd think the right to remain silent wouldn't have been so hard for you.
3,0,0,Try to put on a happy face.
4,2,0,When the bailiff says "all rise", don't get cute.
3,1,0,don't worry, we are going to appeal your live penalty sentence
2,2,0,The death penalty has no effect here.
3,0,0,Again, the death penalty does not hold for loitering.
3,2,2,I'm afraid Death's still on the table.
3,0,0,I'm just sayin', your dark side is darker and than most of my clients so work with me a bit today.
3,0,0,Wouldn't worry. You were just the messenger.
6,0,0,They're want to charge you with murder, but I think we can get it down to manslaughter.
3,2,2,I told you not to wear the hoodie.
3,0,0,They got you for tax evasion. You know the saying: you and taxes.
2,2,0,My soul? Yeah, I'm afraid the Devil got dibs on that one.
3,0,0,These cases always end the same
3,1,0,Slowing overpopulation is a weak defense, but it's all we got.
4,0,0,A life sentence might cramp your style.
2,0,0,The jury's hung.
3,0,0,I guess, this is it.
6,0,0,As your attorney, I must warn you that the court has a strict no hoodie policy.
5,0,0,Be prepared for the worst, the judge's goldfish died yesterday.
2,0,0,Charcoal Portrait of Lawyer and Generic client
4,1,2,Any chance tomorrow you can wear the plaid outfit , you are scaring the jury
5,0,0,My guess is they'll vote for the one named after you.
2,0,0,dude just play it cool, no one will think you wanted to kiss that girl
2,0,0,Stop looking so grim.
2,0,0,Look, I'm your attorney. Your scythe will be safe in my office...you've got to trust me. Oh, and keep the hood on. Trust, remember? I've been around the block a few times on account of you.
3,0,0,Try not to look so vacant.
2,0,0,The Judge said you CAN sue all those guys who claimed they cheated you.
4,1,0,It's "inevitable" and "would you rather pay taxes" are not good defenses.
3,0,0,You are against the death penalty?
3,1,0,I think we should file a petition for habeas corpus.
6,0,0,im telling you, she was dead before i got there
4,0,0,Admit nothing! We allow their souls to wander the earth, and your back in the death game. Deal? No need to shake on it.
2,2,0,I'm sorry you didn't get the death penalty. I tried.
3,1,1,Guess a death sentence hits close to home, eh?
8,0,1,Just testify that "the devil made you do it".
3,0,0,Seriously? Now we have a hung jury.
3,0,0,Okay, if it comes down as a Life Sentence, I'll file a quick appeal and see if I can get you Death.
3,1,0,I got them to drop the death penalty.
3,0,0,Sorry sir, we strive to appear transparent here
3,1,0,You're right - you should do the closing argument.
4,1,4,I don't think self-defense is the way to go.
2,2,0,At least try looking remorseful.
3,3,1,Don't forget...smile at the jury!
3,2,1,I said a business suit AND a tie.
2,2,0,I really feel like you should have worn a suit.
2,0,0,No Grim Reaper! Death is your job. We can't argue it wasn't premeditated.
6,3,0,I'm afraid that this state has abolished the death penalty.
3,0,1,We're *this* close to a mistrial, Dave... can you dial it down a notch?
3,1,1,At least you won't have to worry about the death sentence.
3,0,0,I understand you are a serious individual, but if we can talk about your personal interests--say, your troll doll collection, for example--perhaps the jury will be able to relate to you a little better.
3,1,0,Mr. Trump had to blame someone for killing his campaign!
7,0,0,You're the injured party. It wouldn't hurt to show some emotion.
3,1,0,The problem is mainly the hoodie.
3,0,0,The jury's looking Grim.
7,0,0,We are going to Trump!
4,0,0,If all goes well I can get you the death sentence.
3,0,1,I'll move for a mistrial. If the judge says no, you kill everyone but me.
2,0,0,No, we can't plead this out to get a life sentence.
2,0,0,You of all people should have known the difference between a hung jury and a hanged jury.
2,0,0,There's quite a few old people on the jury.
2,0,0,It IS life affirming. You're sentenced for life, for god's sake.
2,0,0,After we're done here can you come with me to visit my mother-in-law?
3,1,0,How do you know their lead witness won't testify?
3,0,0,Eventually you will need to show up in person.
2,0,0,Don't take the deal. I mean, what's the worst that could happen "The Death Penality?"
2,2,0,Your outfit doesn't exactly scream "Innocent."
3,0,0,We need to make this guy think he's looking Death right in the face.
4,1,0,No, I'm sorry, we needed an execu-TOR.
3,1,1,"No offense, you come across a little grim.".
2,2,0,You want to plead 'guilty as sin?'
2,0,0,Who are plaintiffs? Well...I guess everybody.
3,0,0,You really want the death penalty?
3,1,0,I'm sorry; life without parole. I know you had your heart set on the death penalty.
4,0,0,Is there any way you can make eye contact when you testify?
1,0,0,I'm hoping we can exclude your prior record.
3,0,1,No, I don't have any books on black magic.
3,0,0,Let's review the charges: manslaughter of, well, everyone.
3,1,0,Things are looking pretty grim.
2,0,0,You've got the wrong Ebinezer.
3,0,0,At least try to look remorseful?
2,0,0,Repeat after me, religious freedom.
3,2,1,Try to smile more for the jury.
3,1,0,Are you sure you want to seek a life sentence?
2,2,0,I didn't say "let's" get rid of Juror No. 7.
3,0,1,Your attire is inappropriate for an alleged serial killer.
3,0,0,Let me explain how the death penalty works.
4,1,0,Just because you're dead doesn't mean you're above the law.
2,0,0,Could you maybe lose the hoodie?
2,0,0,Try not to hang the jury this time.
3,0,0,I'm afraid you're facing the death penalty.
3,1,0,"After you testify it’s witness protection with a new identity as an Italian geriatric nurse?
3,1,1,The fact that it's your job does not constitute a legal defense.
3,1,0,Good news: you got the death penalty
3,0,0,Are you sure this is a capital offence?
7,0,0,They have a witness who saw The Man Without A Face.
3,1,0,NO, no, my services are free if you promise me not to visit me for at least a hundred years or more. Oh! would you go by and visit my mother in law later today?
3,0,0,I strongly recommend you plead the Fifth.
2,0,0,It doesn't look good. If you plead guilty, they might be merciful and only sentence you with life in prison instead of giving you the you penalty.
2,2,0,I assume you have no problem with the death penalty?
2,2,0,Let's make sure we get you a suit for the next court date.
3,0,1,Well at least the death penalty is off the table.
3,1,0,Are you certain?
3,1,0,This is our last appeal, so please stop referring to your sentence the 'me penalty.'
4,3,2,It was hard to find a jury of your peers.
3,0,0,Don't worry. The death penalty is illegal in this state.
8,0,0,The lawyer replied, 'You said you feel like you are having a panic attack?'
3,1,0,Get over it - there's no way to get your scythe through security.
2,2,0,The witness expired on New Year's Eve...'know anything about that?
2,2,0,Remember, you never touched the guy.
2,0,0,I told you not to hitch your wagon to the taxman.
4,0,0,I can't ethically accept 'never dying' as payment. I'm handling this case pro bono.
7,1,0,No, in this court the judge and jury are separate.
3,1,0,Know of any newly available rent-controlled apartments?
3,1,1,I know it's warm in here, but DO NOT take off your hoodie!!!
7,0,0,I know you're excited, but you will not get the death penalty for tax fraud.
6,1,0,I guess a tax case was inevitable.
2,0,0,If we win, Death be not proud.
3,0,0,That's not exactly what I had in mind when I mentioned a hung jury.
4,0,0,We don't recommend the death penalty for shoplifting
3,0,0,Can we lighten the face to highlight your inner innocence ?
3,1,0,They threw out 106 billion of the counts against you based on the statute of limitations, but that still leaves 1 billion.
3,0,0,I thought you, of all people, would speak Latin.
5,1,0,Trust me. If anyone has standing as a sovereign citizen, it's you!
2,0,0,I don't think you quite understand the concept Habeas Corpus...
3,0,0,Everything's going to be alright. Your execution is beyond human ability.
3,0,0,I advise to lose the hood and plead the fifth.
2,2,0,That's right -- the defense RESTS.
3,1,0,Counsel for the defense, you may step down.
3,1,0,I think you should drop the lawsuit. They're not going to repeal the helmut law
3,0,0,I am sorry Mr. Scrooge, but I am afraid you may have to face the music.
3,0,0,Scythes are definitely offensive weapons and the judge is not a, 'most excellent dude!'
7,1,0,Duck. She said the robberr was wearing a hoodie.
2,0,0,This is The People's Court. Dead Reckoning is upstairs.
4,0,0,Your alibi is good.
2,4,1,Yes, I know you have some experience with plea bargaining, but let me handle this.
2,0,0,No worries! This state has abolished the death penalty
2,0,0,Do you realize how hard it is to be your lawyer?
7,0,1,I think the best we can hope for is life.
2,0,0,If worse comes to worst, you could get life.
2,2,0,Of course We'll appeal it if they give you "Life."
3,0,1,What are your credentials for being a death penalty expert?
3,0,0,I got them down to 100 billion manslaughters.
3,0,0,No, I don't think a game of chess would help.
2,0,0,Death AND taxes?
3,1,0,Listen--if you want to have a shot with the jury, you've gotta drop the hoodie.
2,0,0,I'm not sure that this judge will consider a voice message a binding contract that you won a free Caribbean Cruise.
2,0,0,Don't be so grim, the jury is still out.
2,0,0,You have the right to remain passive.
3,0,0,Mr Reaper, I've spoken to our P R boys and they REALLY don't think the scythe will make the jury more sympathetic towards you.
2,0,0,Try not to look so grim when the judge walks in.
2,0,0,What are you doing here? The death penalty is supposed to be for the poor and people of color.
3,1,0,Well, yes. Scientology does enforce that Billion Year Contract.
5,0,0,You might've expected the metal detector to pick up the scythe.
3,1,0,Let's hope for a hung jury.
5,0,0,Don't worry...we can always get you a movie deal.
3,1,0,I advise you not to take the stand
2,2,0,Just cutting grass? No, that's not credible.
3,0,0,I think I can get the line up ID thrown out.
3,0,1,Let's tell the judge that you were only doing your job.
4,0,1,Hard to find a sympathetic jury.
2,0,0,Honestly, that "eyes are the windows of the soul" doesn't matter in court.
3,0,0,The reaper is admissible, but I'm objecting to calling it grim.
2,0,0,I know you look forward to a hung jury, but I'd like to win this.
3,0,0,Good news. It's only a life sentence.
2,0,0,Yes, of course, my fee is negotiable.
