18,7,0,We should have left our training wheels on.
22,2,1,You were right, Matt, Colorado is a lot of fun!
15,7,1,We'll fix it in post.
18,6,1,On second thought, I'll take saddle sores over splinters any day.
19,4,1,They're catching up - Go, Billy, go!
11,11,3,This is exactly the sort of thing I warned you about when we became piggy bank robbers.
21,2,0,Oh, yeah, we're rockin' along, but I'm afeared of the dark horse back yonder.
20,5,0,Nyah, nyah, nyah, you can't catch me.
11,9,2,If you think this is bad, try robbing a bank with a cap gun!
20,3,1,You may be law abiding men, and the two of us not so much. Yet the ASPCA will be so pleased at how we all have come together.
15,7,3,If you think this is a long, drawn out process, just wait til you go to court.
19,4,2,You misheard me friend. I said,"We AREN'T looking for trouble."

14,9,2,He's off his rocker!
22,2,0,I thought we were going to get "stock" horses.
22,3,0,What does cartoon logic say about us using our guns?
14,7,2,Hope those guns are real, Sheriff Hasbro.
21,1,0,Your rocking horses aren't going to make a hill of beans difference.

17,4,2,These horses must be from the Not OK Corral.
18,6,0,I can't tell if they're gainin' on us.
22,2,1,What's the matter, Sheriff? That horseflesh of yourn ain't nothin' but an ole rockin' chair.
12,12,0,I said I wanted Rocky Mountain horses, not rocking mountain horses!
15,9,1,Let's just stop and shoot it out, Sheriff - this is getting us nowhere.
16,9,0,Don't you ever again tell that sheriff he's off his rocker!
17,7,2,Your left side rear stick is starting to crack.

15,8,1,We need to talk about the budget for these "Old West" re-enactments.
16,7,0,Now you"ll never catch up with us plus we've got louder caps in our pistols!
21,3,1,If we keep at this pace for a few more hours I'm sure the two of us will maintain a stable distance.
24,3,0,Naturally, the bank robbers got away on coin-operated horses.
20,1,2,I'm sure glad mom bought us those extra caps.

22,4,0,Manual warfare ain't what it used to be.

26,0,0,Just paraphrasing Bruce Dern as Jack Strawhorn: Every day above ground is a good day!
19,4,0,You'll never catch us! Due to the curved shape of the rocking horse base and Newton's second law, every force has an equal and opposite force. So even if you push toward us, you will rock backward and not make any forward progress!
12,6,6,I knew we shoulda stole them stick horses!
24,1,0,Leave it to my husband to give me a headache during yoga.
18,5,1,This is definitely a B-Western.

23,2,0,I knew we’d never get these damn horses to hover.
25,1,0,We need to ride faster. They're going to catch us if we just keep rockin' along.
12,9,0,Hey Sheriff, we're gonna make a quick potty stop. O.K.?
15,7,2,My mom says I have to be home from the roundup by supper time.
10,11,4,Give it up, Sheriff--we've got a full-day's lead.
17,6,1,It's off to the playpen if they capture us.
20,3,1,...no, 'fun.' This is how the West is FUN!
23,2,0,There must be more money.
14,7,1,I have too much of a head start.
12,9,4,The good news is, they only have cap guns...
16,5,3,Holding onto our hats sure does add to the illusion of forward movement!
21,3,0,We're damned Dick, the sheriff's horse has racing curves
18,4,2,I know it's only rock and roll, but I like it!
21,2,2,Rock faster! I hear banjos.

8,4,7,Don't worry, the camera's only shooting from the waist up.
20,3,0,Hey sheriff, this is my first rodeo. Stop drafting off my Stetson!
16,8,1,Rock harder! They're closing on us!
22,4,0,Well, 'Get Along Little Doggies' is better than 'Hi Ho Silver!'
21,3,0,"Man, those cats are really rockin," they're really rockin'"...
19,5,3,We're at full tilt and they're right behind us!
21,5,0,We better forward and back...they are teetering on us.
17,4,2,At this rate, we'll NEVER get to the nursery.
20,5,0,Let's go round up them wooden cattle.
18,6,1,They ain't gonna catch us, but we ain't gonna get any farther away!
11,8,5,It's OK...they haven't gained on us in an hour.
17,7,2,When we catch him we will put on his pajamas but no TV.
23,2,0,Establishment losers again; they're on wooden hobby horses!
15,8,2,I reckon the Pinkertons got the same carpenter.
17,6,1,You're darn right I sound ornery. I just figured that outhouse isn't get'n any closer either.
19,4,0,Sheriff, you rock my world!
20,3,2,We just have to make it to Banbury Cross.

24,0,0,These are twice as fast as your 1 horse-power limo.
17,6,2,And there's a carousel posse right behind them.
22,2,0,This ain't real, pardner. Just rememberin' my childhood.
15,9,1,Should've turned left at the monkey bars
8,13,5,One more low-budget role, and I'm firing my agent.
16,6,3,Be on the lookout for Indians. They have real horses.
18,4,2,The Good, the Bad, and the Incapacitated
12,10,4,To catch Billy the Kid, you have to think like Billy the Kid.
20,4,1,Don't worry, Jeb. I reckon they bought their horses at the rocking horse ranch too.
11,7,8,Personally I think the Humane Society's demands are getting unreasonable.

16,6,5,Ride faster or they'll catch us by naptime.
19,5,1,Game on! Hobby or lifestyle?
19,6,1,You call that a posse??!!
19,2,0,Trotters can't gallop! I'm tellin' Mom!
19,5,1,Dang it, Larry, I sure wish they'd hurry up an' invent the tricycle.
12,8,4,I'm beginning to think only the screen behind us is moving...
17,4,1,This is what you get for spending the most of the movie budget on these stupid hats!
23,2,0,You'll not live to see me hang, Pinkerton!
21,4,1,Perhaps good never prevails over evil.
19,3,2,Rock harder! They might be gaining on us.
20,6,0,Hold it right there, cowboys!
20,4,1,They're still there. Lucky for us they just have cap guns.

17,2,1,That posse must be makin' a hobby of chasing us!
15,7,2,I’ve got to say when they tamed the old Wild West they took all of the fun out of it.

18,3,3,Not so fast!
22,1,0,Yoh! "Establishment" on the horse with a wooden d...: You're rockin' to the wrong beat!
13,6,4,Fake horses and real guns - who wrote this, PETA and the NRA?
16,5,0,You'll never catch up to me at that rate!
14,8,3,Dammit Bill, I told you rocking horse pass was a bad idea.
20,2,1,Where'd ja get YOUR Tesla horse?

14,7,5,Eat my sawdust, law man!
22,2,1,Be careful of those rocks or we'll fall right into the sheriff's lap.
17,5,2,All we was doin' was rockin' and a-boppin' and singin' a song.
16,3,3,I must have been off my rocker. I never should have entrusted a PETA member with rounding up the horses for our escape.
23,3,1,You've got cooties!
14,9,3,We're not gonna lose 'em if we keep going back and forth down this road!
15,5,2,You'll never catch me, even when the music stops.

16,5,1,Twerk faster Bart, their gaining!
22,2,1,Hey sheriff, fyi, the Pi ratio of our rocking horses is identical, so it's virtually impossible for you to ever catch us.
20,1,1,Officers, you rock! But as members of the "giddy-up-gang", so do we.
24,0,0,When are Billy Crystal and Jack Palance going to show up?
