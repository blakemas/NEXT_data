5,0,0,I see that you're still living with your mother.
4,1,0,Something tells me you weren't entirely truthful in your Tinder profile.

4,1,0,I guess we'll see who's more flexible.
5,0,0,What, do you think the ancient Hindu had microfiber mats?
4,1,0,It's like vegan break-dancing

4,1,0,I'm pretty sure that's not what she meant when she asked you to pick her up at Yoga!!
4,1,0,My, my, where do I begin to explain why 'absolutely not' is my reaction?
5,0,0,Yes, we do the dog pose, but you can't bring your dog to class.
5,0,0,I think this job sharing has gone too far!

5,0,0,No way! I hardly know you.
4,1,0,Sorry, "Bow Down" in yoga has no religious implication.
5,0,0,Is it moth proof
5,0,0,I just came back from India.
5,0,0,Sure, I'll trade you. Let me give you my card.
4,0,1,Our website says we offer yoga and zumba classes here, not Roomba.
3,1,1,I don't think you understand. You're supposed to be uncomfortable.
5,0,0,What, the hat?
4,0,0,We must accept that the floor is hard and user space is small, son.
4,0,1,I can see you're tense.
5,0,0,We'd have to charge you six times for the space.
5,0,0,Well, I'd recommend a smaller mat for next time, and saying"namaste" instead of "Let's go, Red Sox!"
3,0,0,Geography isn't my strong suit.
4,1,0,Just fly in?

5,0,0,Because a Scout must also be flexible.
2,1,1,How hard is it to Google ‘yoga mat’?
5,0,0,Sorry, the Cleopatra roll is not a pose I use.
4,1,0,No, in this case size really doesn't matter.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, this relationship is no longer mutually beneficial
4,0,1,What a fancy yoga mat! Where can I buy it?
4,2,0,Let me guess -- just got divorced?
5,0,0,That's right - if you take up two spaces, you pay double the fee.
3,2,0,Does it fly too?
5,0,0,It's not the size that matters, Mr. Little, it's how you use it."
5,0,0,I'm guessing you are the new apprentice.
5,0,0,Yes, that bread chemical is also in yoga mats, but the mats are perfectly safe.

5,0,0,Agoy Nwod Wob means your coming at this from the wrong perspective.
5,0,0,Don't tell me, your hands aren't small either.
5,0,0,Nobody is buying it that you found Shiva's original yoga mat.
4,0,0,Our policy here is flexible.
4,1,0,No,the other ladies would not like to share your mat with you.
5,0,0,And I suppose your name is Aladdin.
4,1,0,For the last time Jeff, I'm not interested in romantic yoga for two!
4,0,1,This is a yoga studio, not Downton Abbey.
4,0,0,The "Make America Great Again" cap is okay, but we don't allow Oriental rugs.
3,1,0,I did not say you have small hands, Billy.
5,0,0,My bathroom mat was wet.
4,1,0,My yoga mat may be carcinogenic, but you should see how your 'natural' mats stick to these $200 leggings.
4,1,0,Are you moving in or downward, dog?
4,0,0,I refuse to go broke shopping at lululemon.
5,0,0,Overcompensation is not a pose.
6,0,0,Carpet flying is the next session.
5,0,0,I'm here for the Persian yoga session.

5,0,0,No, you do not need an oriental rug for tai chi.
4,1,0,My wife told me that y’all might be able to teach me how to ride this thing.
4,1,0,We specialize in cleaning minds, not rugs.
5,0,0,This will make me look more masculine with all these girls.
5,0,0,It smells as though Fido had decided to do a Downward Dog pose on the rug I brought for class.
4,0,0,No, you can't demonstrate the sleepy-time pose.
2,3,0,Broga is tomorrow night.
6,0,0,Yogi's carpet repair is next door.
4,1,0,It's high time we had a chat about your little rug problem.
3,1,1,Namaste. That means beat it.
4,1,0,Oh my god, size isn't EVERYTHING you know...
5,0,0,Julius Caesar's studio is up the street.
5,0,0,Big rug, small hands... Big deal.
4,1,0,No, Zen Napping is next door.
4,1,0,The Leave It to Beaver Yoga Class is down the hall.
5,0,0,First of all it's called a "mat" and no we can't put the game on TV.
3,1,1,I'm guessing you drive a Corvette too.
5,0,0,Is the snow that deep or are the new neighbors midgets?
5,0,0,Perhaps you're from the rug rat generation.
5,0,0,You arrived in the stretch limo, right?
5,0,0,You're like some guy with an RV camper going backpacking.
5,0,0,First it's 79 cents for every dollar you earn and now this; so, yes, I can tell you where to put your rug.
4,1,0,Over-compensating again, are we?
5,0,0,No, I won't yoga-long with you.
4,0,1,You must be a mama's boy.
3,1,1,"It's what Trump would do," does not give the right to take up more real estate than the rest of the class.

3,2,0,First time I presume...
3,2,0,I don't care what they said on Ebay, that's not an antique yoga mat.
4,1,0,Aladdin lives next door.
5,0,0,This is yogA, with an A and in "America." You're looking for the yogI, with an i as in "India." We prefer rubber mats.
4,1,0,Your mat is looking a bit rug-ed.
5,0,0,Today we learn the manspreading position.
6,0,0,Bow Down Yoga isn't right for everyone.
5,0,0,I don't care if you got iy from Ray Bolger.

4,0,0,You're looking for man cave yoga - that's three doors down.
5,0,0,I don't care if it makes you feel more at Om.
5,0,0,No I didn't say, 'roll up Matt.'
4,1,0,Did you bring a magic lamp as well, Aladdin?
3,2,0,For the last time, I won't take a magic yoga ride with you!

5,0,0,I'm sorry, but you can't "audit" this class.
5,0,0,Magic carpet rides are next door... But I'll go with you...

5,0,0,Sorry, "Take Your Ogre to Class" Day was last week.
4,1,0,Namastainmaster.
3,2,0,It's 'bow down', not 'move in'.
5,0,0,Now what's your mother gonna say when she finds her rug beneath the dining room table is gone? Hmm?
4,0,0,I was told to bring my own mat from home
4,1,0,We don't encourage that much comfort.
3,2,0,Here, this has seen one too many downward squatting dogs.
5,0,0,I don't care how huge is mat is -- tell Mr. Trump he gets the same floor space as everyone else.
3,2,0,Trying to overcompensate dear ?
5,0,0,You pay for floor space by the square inch.
5,0,0,It's the only mat I could find.
2,2,0,First day?
4,0,0,Is this the class for beginners?
5,0,0,This is 'Bow Down Yoga' - NOT yoga for dorks ... lose the shoes, socks, cap and funky blanket please!"
3,2,0,This is just like that time you brought the foam finger to the ballet.
5,0,0,Well...there goes the neighborhood
3,1,0,"Man-spreading" is also frowned upon here.
4,0,0,You do have the family rate?
5,0,0,This first problem for all of us to to unlearn.
3,2,0,It's actually the socks up to the knees that are really bothering me.
6,0,0,I use it for my Lazy Elephant" pose.
3,2,0,When I said to bring your rug, I meant your toupee.
5,0,0,The sign at the door clearly says no shoes or socks allowed
2,3,0,I'm afraid that won't fly
4,0,0,Sorry, there's really no such thing as a 'pick-up game' in yoga.
5,0,0,It's perfect for our locker room.
3,2,0,This class may not be big enough for the both of us.
3,2,0,This is about a girl, isn't it?
5,0,0,Your flying really disrupts the class.
5,0,0,There may be some lingering resentment.
5,0,0,Is this the group yoga class?
5,0,0,Ron, I don't appreciate your passive aggressive reminder that I need a wax.
4,1,0,Okay, but only if it levitates along with you.
5,0,0,No, we don't want to buy any PDX carpet to keep our yoga studio weird
5,0,0,Sir, as I have already told you over the phone, we do not offer magic carpet rides.
4,1,0,Yes,Yoga can be masculine BUT we have traditions!
2,3,0,Ok, but I'm saying "NO" to the recliner, the big screen TV and beer coolers
6,0,0,My yogi is a real bear
1,1,2,Our fees are based on square footage.
4,1,0,No, I would not like to go for a 'magic carpet ride'.

5,0,0,I'm sorry Mr. Room, but that's just not funny.
3,2,0,Ah, you're looking for 'Throw Down Yoga.' It's two doors down.
4,1,0,Don't be surprised if I show up at your office with an equally ludicrous unsolicited recommendation.
3,1,1,We're going to put you in the back.
3,1,1,No, I don't fancy a shag.
4,0,0,This rug drives 285 yards. I guarantee.
5,0,0,No shoes, no shag, no service.
5,0,0,Yes, yoga originated in Asia but you must have a "Yoga mat" not an Oriental carpet to participate.
4,0,0,My shovel started out that big
3,2,0,It isn't the rug or the clothes. It's the trash-talk.
3,1,1,Rugs are NOT the new mat
4,1,0,Perhaps you need to meditate with a Hoover first.
4,1,0,They stopped offering casual Fridays months ago.
3,1,0,Persian yoga was at 2pm

5,0,0,Explain to me how this makes any less sense?
5,0,0,Lululemon--not made in Yemen...

4,1,0,I get it; you have your image to protect.
5,0,0,Power yoga is down the block.
4,0,0,Maybe Cleopatra doesn't WANT to learn yoga.
5,0,0,Your spot next to the fireplace.
5,0,0,We recommend a 60% wool blend shag carpet for beginners.

3,1,0,We're a strict no-frills yoga studio.
4,1,0,You'll have to do your flying from the outdoors.
5,0,0,I'm sorry sir, we do not offer high intensity yoga classes.

5,0,0,You look like a poser. And I don't mean the good kind.
5,0,0,First day of retirement?
6,0,0,This class is for YOGA people, not YOGI (BERRA) people!
5,0,0,Sorry, no Aladdin registered here.
5,0,0,Who are you calling a "poser"?!
5,0,0,We can be done before your wife finds out you borrowed her priceless antique rug.
2,1,3,The Dude lives downstairs.
5,0,0,Yes, we do promise after only one session you will carry your body differently.
6,0,0,Your place or mine?
5,0,0,You're supposed to leave your shoes and your ego at the door.
4,1,0,beginning yoga is room five.
3,2,0,A Hummer with a Jersey plate was left outside with its lights on. I assume its yours.
5,0,0,It seems you misunderstand our name: this is not campaign training for Trump supporters.
3,1,0,'Super size me' is not an option.
3,1,0,It's unorthodox, but I suppose a magic carpet would work as well as a mat.
5,0,0,Listen, from now on Cleopatra walks in the front door the normal way.
3,1,0,Full-Contact Yoga is next door.
5,0,0,It's just 'Bow Down Yoga' now; the 'Aladdin Magic Carpet' chapter folded up because of the recession.

4,1,0,Sleeping is my workout.
4,0,0,I'm sorry. It's too yuge to make yoga great again.
3,0,0,What? Your the one who said size doesn't matter.
4,1,0,Hmmm. Let me meditate on that one. ...
4,1,0,Fine . . . but when we go to the ballgame I get to take your recliner
3,2,0,First time here?
4,1,0,Today is gentle yoga, tomorrow we do a more rugged class.

5,0,0,This came from Alibaba himself.
4,1,0,The Agoy Nwod Wob rug gallery is next door.

4,0,0,Ixnay on the rug, ixnay on the Twister mat rolled up inside.
4,1,0,That's fine. I'm flexible.

2,2,0,Oh sorry, this is Hatha Yoga. Persian Yoga is tomorrow.
4,0,0,Make sure the whole body goes down the wood chipper.
5,0,0,It's okay to use the rug as yoga mat, but the incense and sitar music have to go.
5,0,0,I'm sorry sir, but you're going to have to remove your hat.
4,1,0,No. This is not where you take a rug for yogurt stains.
5,0,0,I realize you're NEW but, at Bow Down Yoga, you need to KOWTOW, and bring a regulation mat.
4,0,1,No shoes here please.
3,2,0,I see your downward dog is a Pekingese.
3,2,0,You can try the mosque next door but I don't think they'll want it, either.
4,1,0,What ever happened to ladies first?
4,1,0,Matt, you of all people should know the difference.
3,0,2,No rugrats in yoga.
5,0,0,No, sir. This class won't teach you how to make your rug into a flying carpet.
5,0,0,First time with yoga?
5,0,0,If someone dies during class, your job is to dispose of the body.
4,0,0,I think it best if you step over to the mirror and decide if you'd be a good fit for this studio. Namaste.
5,0,0,Son, a real man doesn't blame his tools.
4,0,0,How you got "an exotic and dangerous surprise" from "tries to say flexible" is beyond me.
5,0,0,I think you have the wrong idea your downward dog pose...
5,0,0,Let the wild rumpus begin.
5,0,0,Watch the hair!
5,0,0,I'd like to sign up. I'm down, dog.
3,2,0,No, I don't want to shag.
5,0,0,Sorry, this is a manspread-free space.
5,0,0,It's not all about the size of the mat you know...
4,1,0,Size really doesn't matter.
4,0,0,The new girl is old money.
4,1,0,"While I can appreciate the aesthetic value, your nonconformity is really throwing off my aura.
5,0,0,Unless you've got the instructor's body is wrapped up in that thing...keep away.
6,0,0,I can't afford to pay for a Persian carpet.
5,0,0,Oh my, that rug stinks. Sorry, people who use oriental rugs for hot yoga need not apply.
2,2,1,I take it you roll your own?

3,1,0,Next time bring the rug from your bathroom.
4,1,0,Look lady, I can either use this class as my man spreading catharsis, or your seat on the subway. It's your choice.
4,0,0,Remind Yo Momma not to forget her mat next time.
5,0,0,Let me get this straight....you want to show us what happened with your downward dog?
5,0,0,You've brought a mat. I can tell we're going to enjoy working together.
4,1,0,It's for my political yogis following the campaign--they need a bigger rug to sweep the bull under.
3,1,0,Okay, I'll charge your mites half price.
5,0,0,The bliss of your being ends at my asana.
4,1,0,I admire your cultural sensitivity, but Oriental exercises do not require Oriental mats.
4,1,0,But. It's made out of all organic materials!
6,0,0,I agree an oriental rug reduces stage cable clutter and improves acoustics ... you realize yoga doesn't care?
5,0,0,I think I DO know what I would find, so no thanks to the magic carpet ride.
4,1,0,What kind of moron brings an area rug to a yoga class? Namaste.
1,3,0,True, Helen is a bit overweight but I think this will give her a complex.
5,0,0,This is bow down yoga not chow down yoga!
5,0,0,That's not what I meant by 'trunk'.
5,0,0,It's nice that you're finally making an effort to share my interests, Mike, but maybe you should start with something else.
3,1,0,You're a day late. Aladdin quit as of yesterday.
4,1,0,It really ties my workout together.
4,0,1,Dude. I meant a yoga mat.
5,0,0,Next door.
5,0,0,Yeah, you're probably the more likely to occur before a cartoonist draws a black person in a yoga studio. IDK why it's called "Bow Down Yoga".
4,1,0,My higher self likes to be comfortable.
3,1,0,It's not Yo, G.
5,0,0,You look like Trump, so leave.
5,0,0,Overcompensating a little?
4,1,0,Get a grip! I'm paying $125 a square foot to rent this place.
5,0,0,Seriously? You brought an Indian rug to a bikram yoga class?
5,0,0,Damn Daniel back at it again with the Persian rug
4,2,0,You misunderstood, I asked for a hug!
4,1,0,Zumba is at 4PM
4,1,0,I'm sorry, we don't do Persian Yoga here.
5,0,0,Frank, I appreciate the offer, but I don't feel the class is ready for Bigger is Better Xtreme yoga.
4,1,0,You're putting me in a tough position here, Greg.
4,1,1,Only if it flies.
5,0,0,ts Its a cylindrical yoga mat for maximal relaxation. i
4,0,0,What idiot told you we carpet bomb during this session ?
5,0,0,Put. That Rug. Down!! Rugs are for Yoga only. Do you think I'm f'ing with you? I am not f'ing with you. I'm here from downtown. I'm here from Samir and Ravi.
4,0,1,Sorry you are upset, we don't have a nap time
3,2,0,All yoga mats are oriental rugs, but not all oriental rugs are yoga mats.
4,1,0,How many times have I told you that Yoga does not involve wrestling?
5,0,0,Are you overcompensating for something?
5,0,0,Mat, Matt. Mat!

5,0,0,Bigger isn't always better, Ron.
5,0,0,The industrial strength class is down the street.
4,0,1,I thought your online profile read, "yoga lover"
5,0,0,Mr. Smyth, this would make one of those New Yorker cartoons that nobody gets.
4,1,0,No, I did not say "carpet diem".
3,0,2,I'm surprisingly OK with the hat, wrist bands, and rug, but I just can't look past the tube socks.
5,0,0,We used to use thicker mats in Alaska.
5,0,0,Sorry, that's not what I ordered. I need something in a cut pile.
5,0,0,You know we have loaner mats, right?
5,0,0,Drop-ins are welcome. We ask only that each yogi park their privilege... next to their shoes... at the door.
5,0,0,This is yoga, not breakdancing class."
5,0,0,Please tell Her Majesty Queen Cleopatra that all the reporters have left.

5,0,0,Flows before bros?
4,0,1,The manspreading class is at 4 pm.
4,0,0,The class thinks using a magic carpet as your yoga mat is too flamboyant.

5,0,0,Did you bring your "Lazy Boy"recliner too?
5,0,0,Jasmine's classes are on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
5,0,0,Here we practice slim yoga. Your mat tells me that you are looking for alpine yoga.
6,0,0,Good disguise, Pizza Boy, but I think the delivery was for next door.
4,1,0,'The School to Master the Flying Carpet’ has moved to the ground floor of this building.
5,0,0,Namaste? No. Must not stay.

3,2,0,You do know what they say about men with big yoga mats, right?
4,1,0,I don't care what anyone told you, there's no such thing as an Upward Facing Trump.

5,0,0,The sign clearly says, 'No Persians.'
5,1,0,Shall we begin with a couple of suggestions.
3,0,0,It's yoga, yog-a, not yog-i.
5,0,0,It's bow down yoga....not ballroom yoga.
5,0,0,You still haven't breathed out.
5,0,0,See, this is what I mean -- you don't understand me, Norman.
5,0,0,Sorry, sir, but that’s one thing we don’t appropriate from Eastern culture.
3,1,0,So when did mindless take over from mindful?
4,1,0,Yeah, you should probably move the rest of your stuff too.
6,0,0,A Persian carpet? Our trainer banned them since Obama's nuclear deal.
5,0,0,...and we are not all vegans.
2,2,0,You must practice the Turkish branch of yoga.
3,2,0,Carpet cleaning is next door
4,0,0,It is lovely. It is Indian. It does smell like "down dog". And there lies our problem.

5,0,0,There's no such thing as a yoga rug, Jay.
3,1,1,Are you having people over?

4,1,0,It's 'Bow Down Yoga,' not 'Have It Your Way Yoga.'
5,0,0,I know it's an unusual mat. Just don't call me out on the carpet.
3,0,1,May I suggest you work on your outer self first.
5,0,0,Please put that back. We can rent you one.
5,0,0,I think you might be looking for the hookah lounge, it's across the street.
6,0,0,Where am I going to put this? I'll tell you where.
3,2,0,Om my God.
4,0,1,You are yoga but not our sort of yoga.

4,0,0,Well, NOW you're going to be relaxed.
4,0,0,Think of it as "Yoga" meaning "You Oughta Get A" followed by the word "mat". NOT "carpet"
4,0,1,Wrong religion Larry!
4,1,0,Thanks, but we're not interested in an 'upgrade' at this time.
5,0,0,Your dirty mat makes me want to throw up, not bow down.
3,0,0,Organic, all natural, yes. But even we have our limits.
5,0,0,No, we're Bow Down. Berra is across the street.
3,2,0,You're an hour early for the session with Alladin
3,1,0,Please deliver him back to the mosque.
5,0,0,Doesn't matter what Yogi says: you can't take a two-hour nap here from 1 to 4.
5,0,0,I don't care if it did belong to your granny, it is not acceptable here.
5,0,0,No, it WILL take up room on the floor because that is NOT a flying carpet...
5,0,0,Namasté, but you're not exactly doing your root chakra any favors here.
5,0,0,Get real big boy! Size doesn't mean squat in the race to yogahood.
5,0,0,Dude the magic carpet class is next door in the boot room.
5,0,0,I’m not your “dude.”
5,0,0,This is a Yoga studio, not a mosque!
5,0,0,Kindergarten is in the next room, wiseguy.
5,0,0,You said get comfortable.

4,1,0,That goes next door at the Bow Wow boutique
4,1,0,Namaste' AWAY!
5,0,0,OK, you can use that for a mat. But the 70s socks have got to go.
4,1,0,I know you want to get closer to my inner-self, Honey, but your inner-self needs to get the heck out of here!
5,0,0,No, you can't just hang out here with friends.
5,0,0,No, I don't know which direction faces East.

5,0,0,What do you mean there's a twenty dollar delivery fee?
2,2,0,Only on Throw Rug Thursdays
4,1,0,We're not interested in your new softer mats. Yoga encourages suffering.
5,0,0,Why do I feel like I just found the " Grey" M&M? I'll call you on the carpet in that corner over there.
5,0,0,Fine, as long as your downward dog doesn't bite.
4,1,0,Magic carpet or not - there's no such thing as aerial yoga sir.
5,0,0,Nobody needs their carpet laid.
5,0,0,You really know how to spin a yarn, Henry.
4,0,0,I know we said we'd do more stuff together but...
5,0,0,No, Kama Sutra class is in Studio B.
3,2,0,You're new here. Right?
5,0,0,Sure. And I have Antony in mine.
5,0,0,you only need a mat not a rug.
4,0,1,I think you're over-thinking this.
4,1,0,Sorry Lebowski... it doesn't tie the room together.
5,0,0,But that rug really tied the room together.
5,0,0,Well, you brought a water bottle, right?
3,1,0,Use whatever you want. We're flexible.
3,1,0,No group rates. And that's final.
5,0,0,FLYING CARPETS YOGA is two blocks up the hill.
5,0,0,Why did you come here?" "Well...To dance I think.
5,0,0,And I say you can't nama-'stay'.
5,0,0,That's not a yoga mat... THAT'S a yoga mat!
2,2,1,Compensating for low chi?
5,0,0,You must be a big poser.
3,2,0,The cap is a distraction, it has to go.
3,2,0,And what state you do hope to attain with that?
4,1,0,You're early. Aladdin's class is at noon.
5,0,0,I have a delivery for Cheech and Chong.
3,1,0,We actually can afford to cover the entire floor.
3,1,0,Are you here to do yoga or to be Aladdin?

4,0,0,What I need is a psychiatrist; I'm twisted.
5,0,0,Our instructor, Mr Baba, sbould help you overcome your fear of flying!
3,1,0,Trump Yoga is the next door down.
5,0,0,No sir, the shaggy rug would not necessarily improve your performance inside or outside the studio.
3,2,0,Yes, 'Namaste' does sound an awful lot like 'no mats today'.
4,1,0,Not if you keep calling it a camel toe viewing platform.
4,1,0,Sorry. The studio has a " Say no to rugs" policy.
6,0,0,Honey, you will find competitiveness is not the pathway to Tantra!
4,0,0,Well, that's one position we don't care to stretch.
6,0,0,Size does matter
5,1,0,Why must males always have bigger equipment?
3,2,0,Ahh..Meditation 101 is down the hall.
4,1,0,Did someone call Uber Carpet Rides?
2,3,0,I was wrong about yoga being for everyone.
5,0,0,My downward facing alligator requires a rather large surface area.
4,1,0,It is not!
5,1,0,Assume the turn-around-and-get-the-hell-out-of-here pose, please.
5,0,0,No, a yoga rug is NOT LIKE a rugby rug.
4,1,0,I just feel I need my own space for a while.
4,1,0,That's too much information.
4,1,0,Do we look like the same people who sold you that rug?
5,0,0,Sorry, it's Bow Down, not Boy Town, ladies only.
3,3,0,They call me Downward Doug
5,0,0,Sorry, but due to President Trump's executive directive we had to eliminate our liberal "Persian Rug" policy.
2,2,1,Is this because I brought kale salad to your Super Bowl party?
5,1,0,Sorry, but Mr. Trump owns the building and he said no Persians.
4,0,0,Look Phil...Unless that's a magic carpet, you're still not going to be able to do the one-handed tree pose.
5,0,0,What else was I supposed to put on the non-slip mat?
5,0,0,It's ftom your boyfriend - he thinks your job is making you hard-assed
5,0,0,Right, your weird rug and pulled-up socks were the reasons Marcie left you? Sure those weren't reasons 233 + 234?
4,1,0,Either take those shoes off or get back on your carpet and fly home.
5,0,0,Is this where we channel the divine energy of the macrocosm and attain freedom from the cycle of death and rebirth?
4,0,0,You are to be congratulated, Bob for living your personal mantra. However, here at Bow Down bigger is not always better.
3,0,0,I know you're the only man in the Class but size really does NOT matter.
5,0,0,Actually, the rug is cool, but the socks gave to go.
5,0,0,I don't care if there was a carpet store here. You still can't return it.
6,0,0,Ommm, you're in my way.
4,1,0,We're here to meditate, not levitate.
4,1,0,It's made of hemp and it's perfectly gluten free.
5,0,0,Look - if trump can be elected president, I can say no afghan ...rugs
3,1,1,I don't know which is worse... that your socks are pulled up that high, or that you think you're holding a yoga mat...
5,0,0,No, this is not the "Room" sequel pitch session.
4,1,0,You must be a Neoliberal.
4,1,0,No, we can't be flexible about this.
3,1,0,Even if your downward dog is a Persian mastiff, you can't use it.
5,0,0," I came prepared to stay all day".
4,0,0,That doesn't look like it's from Lululemon...
4,1,0,To practice here you need to be outfitted in Lululemon.
2,1,0,Namaste, no you cannot stay.
4,0,0,I don't care how special it is, Aladdin. It exceeds the allotted floor space
5,0,0,Oh, now I get it...you were talking about your mat!
4,1,0,Let me guess, your name is Aladdin.
3,1,0,Are you going to bring your Barcalounger too?
5,0,0,no thanks. that sounds like too many crouching crotches.
4,0,0,You will never reach Nirvana with that thing.
4,0,0,Sorry--flying carpet yoga is next door.
5,0,0,No dear we do not want to try your flying carpet!!!!
3,1,0,Our Bagdhad branch is across the street
5,0,0,The Grateful Dead singalong is next door.
5,0,0,I believe you have the wrong studio. Magic Carpet yoga is just down the street.
6,0,0,Thanks for coming to today's doga class, but next week you must bring your dog to participate.
4,0,1,I assume you won our donation to the recreation league fundraiser?
3,3,0,You're really challenging my bliss right now.
5,1,0,Carefull,I can still see his feet.
4,1,0,Unless it can fly you will have to go minimalist .
3,2,0,Sir, I'm afraid you'll have to remove that hat for this class.
5,0,0,Namaste Lance. You are the first Texan to try our Groupon.
5,0,0,Hummer or Bimmer?
5,0,0,M A T. Not R U G.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, but we are no longer allowed to practice the Thief of Bagdad pose due to FAA regulations.
5,0,0,I don't want to practice my downward dog pose next to a rug that smells like dog.
5,0,0,Not here you're thinking of yogurt
4,0,0,Please take your shoes off before coming in to the studio.
3,2,0,I don't care what they say about a guy with a big yoga mat.
5,0,0,We are not trying to smuggle weapons here.
5,0,0,It's OK, everyone looks great in yoga pants.
4,1,0,I don't care how many it sleeps.
4,0,0,I'm just saying, there may be an issue with finding your inner balance.
5,0,0,Let's put mine on top of yours.
5,0,0,Let me guess. This is your first day at yoga!
4,0,0,I don't care how much you loved your old dog, you can't use his bed as an exercise mat.
4,0,0,Sit on my face.
5,0,0,Try Hemp Yoga down the street. Sir, our yoga is rayon based.
4,0,1,You know what they say about men with rugs
5,1,0,Floor space is limited; so lose the rug.
5,0,0,"You must be a Republican".
5,0,0,My wife and kids are joining me in a bit
4,1,0,Is it BPA-free?
5,0,0,Please don't make the light within me kick the light within you's ass.
5,0,0,Is my penis bothering you?
4,0,1,Perhaps Hakim can help you.
5,0,0,I just watched "The Big Lebowski."
5,0,0,No, you can not do Yoga and your daily prayers at the same time.
4,0,0,Sorry sir your rug is too big and your shorts are too loose.
5,0,0,Before we start lets talk about expectations
4,1,0,My guess is you have the correct number but way wrong street.
5,0,0,Bigger is not better Zen.
5,1,0,Flying carpet lessons are next door.
5,0,0,Only if you can disinfect it after every use.
5,0,0,Yes, yoga is a type of magic carpet ride, isn't it?
4,1,0,Flying carpet training is next door.
5,0,0,Henry, I never doubted that your's is bigger than mine.
4,2,0,How do I say this...that's NOT a yoga mat. THAT is a conversation starter with your therapist."
4,1,0,I'm new too. Not as new as you.
5,0,0,Before yoga mat was invented.
4,0,0,You just took the 'relaxation' out of 'relaxation technique'.
5,0,0,Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski. Condolences. The bums lost.
5,0,0,So you're the Billy Elliot of yoga, huh?
2,2,0,How about never- is never good for you? Namaste.
5,1,0,over compensating for our short comings?
3,2,0,Brewsky Yoga is next door.
5,0,0,First, I'll lead you though the nasty rug farewell pose, then the new mat salutation. Namaste?
5,0,0,For the last time, sir...there is no way you can do yoga in those shorts.
6,0,0,We have rules! One person on a mat, not an entire little league on one mat.
5,0,0,Yeah, so, big carpets and yoga don't mix. Just ask lululemon.
3,2,0,This is a judgment free zone but your mat's too big.
4,1,0,Carpetbagging meditation, we're not!
5,1,0,You're making us, like, way too uptight.
5,0,0,Like, no, I don't want to smoke it later.
5,0,0,I see you're taking oriental culture seriously.
5,0,0,Did you know there's a boy in there?
3,0,2,The mosque is two doors down.
5,0,0,You're looking for die in the wool yoga
3,1,0,Seriously, I don't think the type of mat matters when yoga was first practiced.
5,0,0,You said bring a mat you could fit a body on right?
5,0,0,Not in my class—unless it's fair trade, of course.
4,1,0,Peace is unchanged by gain or loss...but lose the rug.
5,0,0,Sorry, but for our next class, that needs to Namaste at home.
4,1,0,No, we don't offer deep pile yoga.
5,0,0,You can use it, but your knees are going to hate cobra pose.
5,0,0,No, this is about exercise, not obedience.
5,0,0,Also, downward dog does not involve actual hounds.
3,2,0,Larry, in here size doesn't matter.
5,0,0,Namaste! Looks as though you're all ready for Tree Pose."
3,2,0,You are just off by a few blocks, Aladdin.
3,0,0,Does this look like a rug store to you?
5,0,0,...And take off your cap, too.
2,2,0,I'm guessing this is your first day of yoga ?
5,0,0,It can't make your team win. But you will care less if they lose.
2,3,0,You have to park outside like everyone else.
3,2,0,Over-compensating for something, are we?
5,0,0,Even if we did levitation that would be cheating.
5,0,0,Hug on a rug is not a yoga exercise.
5,0,0,I'm calling you off the carpet.
5,0,0,I know they all look plain, but I'm still not interested!
5,0,0,Do you plan on doing a lot of sweating today?
5,0,0,The latest from Lulu Lemon
5,0,0,Is there a small boy wrapped in that rug?
5,0,0,Take it to the dumps. The hard wood, floor refinisher is coming in the morning and get you Kids out of here.
5,0,0,Sir, the belly dancing class is next door.
4,1,0,Thanks, but the consensus was that it felt too good.
5,0,0,You must be here to see Oprah.
5,0,0,No, just hot yoga. Try 31st between Park and Lex for Persian.
5,0,0,Bro, the tailgate yoga center is down the hall. Namaste!
5,0,0,Just dump the contorted, sweaty body in the Dumpster. Same time, tomorrow?
3,2,0,This is supposed to be a manspread free zone
5,0,0,Please remove your shoes.
3,1,1,This is for exercise, not prayer.
3,2,0,You’re overcompensating.
4,1,0,Sir, rug size doesn't matter here.
4,0,0,Please be more flexible.
1,2,2,So first we breath slowly. And we are mindful. Then, we talk about your mat.
5,0,0,I went to you go rugs instead of yoga rugs. I took the wrong rout!
4,1,0,The 'Yoga For Clueless Guys Level 1' class is in the next room
5,0,0,It's time for you to bow down to me!
3,2,0,So, new to yoga?
3,2,0,In yoga, size does not matter. Namaste.
5,0,0,I'm Shi, I need my rug when preying during yoga.
4,1,0,For the last time sir, we do not permit downward Aladdin's here.
4,0,0,So, you're delivering Donald Trump's yoga mat?
5,0,0,That's the mat for reach up yoga.
5,0,0,Big Lebowski's Tai Chi is next door. I hear the rugs really tie the room together.
4,1,0,Did you remember your coconut water?
5,0,0,...thanks to Yoga for Less I can.
4,0,1,The hat's got to go
5,0,0,The size of the yoga mat doesn't matter. It's the exercise technique that counts the most.
5,0,0,You might want to try Berra Yoga instead, down the street.
5,0,0,Ms. Bliss told me about YOU - get out!
4,0,1,The downward dog is position...not a scent.
2,1,1,Please tell me you didn't come here on the subway.
3,2,0,No, dude, I don't think it ties this room together at all.
5,0,0,No, I will not do couples yoga with you on your magic carpet.
4,0,1,Yes Tommy, this is home-school PE.
3,1,0,I thought I do a try out before I consider buying any new equipment
3,1,1,No manspreading.
4,1,0,Go home, Bill. Vajrasana isn’t what you’re thinking.
3,2,0,I really don't care how much you paid for your Oriental yoga mat.
3,2,0,You do realize this is a no-fly zone.
5,0,0,I know you're trying, Jeff, but I just don't think you'll find inner peace with that outfit and mat.
4,0,1,Thanks but it goes at the front door.
4,0,0,I can help you with the poses but not your fashion sense!
4,1,0,I saw that rug in the lobby
5,0,0,I'm sorry, "one with the rug" doesn't start until 4:20
4,2,0,That will be $40 for four spots!
3,1,0,Unroll that carpet and LET him out of there.
4,1,0,This is yoga. The rug store is down the street.
5,0,0,The studio does not allow astro-turf, you need a yoga mat.
5,0,0,No, sir, I have not seen "Room," and I still fail to see how that has any connection to your overdue membership payment.
6,0,0,Being male doesn't entitle you to extra floor space in class.
3,1,1,I'm sorry, we only do spiritual cleansing.
3,1,0,Mats only and no shoes. Hats optional. Namaste.
6,0,0,We would like it if you would say it's time to unwind, not unroll.
5,0,0,Your Cub Scout Den will have to get their teeny glimpse of Yoga from somewhere else.
4,1,0,It's fine for a beginners class, but over time chakras can damage natural fibers.
4,1,0,Sorry, Persian yoga is two doors down.
4,0,0,All the time you so stupid, Joe.
4,1,0,don't bother trying to impress me with your thread count. ...
5,0,0,I'm sorry that you think our mat rental charge is outrageous.
5,0,0,Yoga has always been GREAT!
5,0,0,I ordered a yoga mat. Not a "when they wore togas" mat.
5,0,0,You must be looking for Shavasana Yoga. That's across the river.
4,0,0,Billy! Didn't I TELL you to remove your hat when in our sacred realm?
3,1,1,OK. You've made your point. I never should have forced you to come to yoga class.
3,1,1,Let me guess... Om Shopping Network?
5,0,0,Looks like someone took corpse pose too seriously.
6,0,0,This is not a spiritual exercise class.
5,0,0,Don’t be surprised if you get called on the carpet someday.
4,0,0,Clawing my way up this downward dog eat downward dog world.
5,0,0,And you must be "Ben Dover"...
4,1,0,Sorry, Bro Down Yoga is across the street.
3,2,0,I see you brought your own mat and attitude.
4,1,0,I'm not that flexible.
5,0,0,Yes my profile did say, "I'm accustomed to the finest amenities"
5,0,0,Deliver it to Bazaar Yoga.
4,1,0,Sweat-repellant, odor-resistant—and indeed, paleo.
3,0,1,I don't care if your yoga master was Persian. The rug goes.
4,0,0,"I don't care how big it is - put on some yoga pants".
5,0,0,I admit it is YUGE but it has no place in my class.
3,1,0,Looks like you really want to feel the burn.
4,0,0,I told you last week that you couldn't wear your shoes in here!
5,0,0,Mat cleaning and repair? Next door.
6,0,0,I brought one big enough for two.
5,0,0,Sorry. Today is Low Lunge. Plow Pose is next week.
5,0,0,No, yogi Berra is not in this class.
5,0,0,If you use that, somebody's bound to call you on the carpet.
5,0,0,I knew Odysseus Grant. He was a charming man. You don't command of a half million men without taking a drop.
5,0,0,Sir. Your mat is too big. You can't carry it and drink a low fat latte at the same time. You must leave.
3,1,0,Sorry, our carpet flying program is on hold pending regulations.
5,0,0,You're never going to find your inner chakra on that!
5,0,0,Sorry, yoga did not come from Persia.
2,3,0,Persian Yoga is down the street.
5,0,0,I'm sure it is magic, but I still need my own space.
6,0,0,Persian yoga? Never heard of it.
5,0,0,I see you're already good at posing.
4,1,0,I am sorry but without the proper mat, you cannot namaste.
4,0,0,The flier said "raja" yoga, not "rug-a" yoga.
5,0,0,I don't care if you slide around when you sweat. No gloves, no shoes and THAT is not a yoga mat.
5,0,0,Take your dust mite colony and get out of here.
3,2,0,Maybe our group isn't right for you.....
5,0,0,Isn't the team going to miss their astro turf.
4,1,0,Bow down refers to yoga positions, not to you.
5,0,1,Are you sure your father's mat wasn't for sumo wrestling?
3,2,0,Broga is down the hall.
5,0,0,No carpetbaggers allowed.
3,2,0,The divine essence in me does not recognize the divine essence in you.
5,0,0,Your ad said to bring a mat.
4,0,0,Sorry we are filled up for all five classes per day.
5,0,0,The Advanced Cultural Appropriation class isn't until 3.
2,2,0,We don't allow manspreading here, sir.
4,0,1,Red neck power yoga is down the hall.
4,1,0,It's not that type of retreat, George.
4,0,0,'' I'M AFRAID YOGA DOES NOT ADDRESS A TERRITORIAL PROBLEM !
4,1,0,I love your for this. But we are done.
3,2,0,Stop trying to sneak her in!
5,0,0,Oops, I brought the wrong one. Then may we share the same rug together?
2,3,0,You still have to take off your socks
5,0,0,"I'd like to sign up for one intense session of mindfulness please, Mam".
5,0,0,Yoga's about breath, not breadth.
6,0,0,No, I'm sorry. We don't offer group rates.
5,0,0,We don't allow rugs or basketball activewear.
3,2,0,We have one rule here--No fringe"
5,0,0,Don't let Trump see it. He'll think you're praying.
5,0,0,Over sized egos do not fit in yoga or this room!
3,1,0,That's a rug not a yoga mat.
5,0,0,Do we have to go over manspreading again?
5,0,0,Do you have unexpected low impact workouts
5,0,0,Mantra. Not manspreading.
5,0,0,As Yoga Master here at Bow Down, I can in all humility assure you that you cannot achieve enlightenment without the proper accessories.
4,0,1,It doesn't match the drapes.
5,0,0,Just plant yourself any where...
3,1,0,I flew magic carpets until I got grounded.
4,1,0,No. No. The Mosque is in the next block.
4,0,0,One-upper.
4,1,0,This isn’t Brooklyn, there are rules.
4,1,0,That wasn't funny when we were dating either
4,1,0,You forgot the coffee and end tables
5,0,0,Today's Class: Brazillian-Vinyasa
3,2,0,At least you made an effort this time.
4,2,0,Okay, so you obviously didn't pay the extra $5.00 to rent a yoga mat.
3,1,1,So, what are you compensating for?
5,0,0,The ad said, "Get rid of body tension here".
4,1,0,Wool, look who's here!
4,0,1,We only allow gluten-free mats.
6,0,0,Magic Carpet Ride Monday was yesterday.
5,0,0,I understand, but our instructors don't make house calls.
5,0,0,That's not what we meant when we said today's yoga session would burn.
5,0,0,Yours always has to be bigger doesn't it?
3,2,0,No free carpet rides here
5,0,0,No, Mr. Rodriguez, we do not allow performance-enhancing rugs
3,2,0,The flying carpet class is on the third floor!
5,0,0,I brought The Magic Carpet so the blue genie can grant you 3 wishes.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, you misheard the instructions, we said you'll need a mat, not a nap
5,0,0,I have my own mat. Stop calling me Cleopatra.
5,0,0,We seek to harmonize with dharma,not wrestle it
5,0,0,Sorry bruh, you know the rules: no mids, no Phillies.
5,0,0,You know, that thing won't protect you from queefs.
5,0,0,Just take that back to Walmart.
5,0,0,Didn't you tell me we were meeting up to go to Antique Roadshow?
5,0,0,I’m sorry, the “magic carpet” area is not yet cleared for take-off.
5,0,0,Share your pad? I'm touched.
5,0,0,Yes, I teach yoga, but I don't have a magic carpet about how you can lose ten pounds.
4,1,0,Don't even think about it.
4,1,0,Let me guess, you're voting for Trump?
4,1,0,Yogi's gym is down the street.
5,0,0,Only if the elephant's Indian.
5,0,0,I think you've made a mistake. This is "Bow Down Yoga," not "Bedouin Yoga."
5,0,0,Doing the Lotus Headstand Variation with Bound Legs would impress me -- your merely sitting cross-legged on a 19th century silk Tabriz does not.
4,1,0,Who do you think you are with the big fancy rug, Donald Trump?
5,0,0,Don’t let our name mislead you. Bow Down Yoga does not approve of a matt being your “Don’t let our name mislead you. Bow Down Yoga does not approve of a matt being your prayer rug.
5,0,0,Yes, you can stay, but 'Rugby's gotta go.
4,0,0,Men and their home comforts!

5,0,0,Look, I know it's a popular class and crowded. But when I said you should stake out a piece of turf, I did not mean literally!
6,0,0,I was hoping to share.
5,0,0,Just so you know, they don’t play “Take me out to the ball game” for music.
4,1,0,You'll find the hot yoga class down the hall...next to the fireplace and easy chair.
5,0,0,A traditional yoga mat is required. I don't care if you expand when you sweat.
5,0,0,No, I haven't seen Sylvia, but she owes us for last week's lesson.
5,0,0,Yes, in some cases size does matter but not with yoga mats.
4,0,1,the guy came to the gym fitness with a carpet and not a sport carpet, so the girl tell him that he can't use it during the period.
5,0,0,you are going to love how much lighter yoga makes you feel my friend.
6,0,0,I think you got my order wrong - I ordered a Persian yoga mat, not carpet.
6,0,0,No, chakras do not come in chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.
4,1,0,Thank you for delivering our new rug on the weekend. Please leave it in the reception area.
4,1,0,Please remove your shoes before entering the studio.
5,0,0,``You appear crude, even vulgar. But if you can breathe and relax when ordered, you'll find only love at Bow Down.''
3,0,1,I think you're overcompensating for something.
5,0,0,I know you're a rugged guy, but this is ridiculous.
1,4,0,Is that your yoga mat or a cry for help?
3,1,1,Are you here for the bro-ga session?
4,1,0,I understand it really ties the room together; it's more an issue of space.
3,2,0,That's not a mat, THIS is a mat!
5,0,0,Please carpet the whole place - Don't know why we didn't do this years ago.
4,1,0,I'm going to have to ask you to take off your shoes.
5,0,0,The new student promotion also throws in a few lamps too.
5,0,0,Sorry, Cleopatra didn't sign up for this session.
5,0,0,Your magic carpet will only make you soft and lost in here.
5,0,0,No. I can't teach you to fly it.
4,1,0,When I said take it to the next level....
4,1,0,No flying carpets, we're a mat based school.
0,3,2,That won't fly in here.
5,0,0,I'm sorry sir but we don't need a new carpet, but a new mat will do.
5,0,0,In America we only use certified non-slip yoga mats.
6,0,0,It's for my down dog.
4,0,1,I don't know what's more offensive Sir--the magic carpet or your fake Indian accent.
4,0,1,No.
4,1,0,We don't allow group bow downs.
2,2,1,Your first lesson will be about how less can be more.
4,1,0,Herbal or not, smoke it outside.
5,0,0,We accept all faiths, make sure your rug is facing East.
4,0,1,Is this 'Agoy Nwod Wob Carpet Emporium?' I brought an over-sized sweepstakes check that I'd like to exchange for a modest area rug.
4,1,0,Think minimalism
4,1,0,I'm sorry, I think you want the Put Down Rug Shop across the street.
3,1,0,Yea, it's one of the things I love about Colorado.
5,0,0,Yoga For Guys Named Colton is on Wednesdays, Colton. Would you mind coming back tomorrow? The instructor you like will be here: the guy who plays Social Distortion and still uses "gay" as a pejorative.
4,1,0,They don't have a Merit Badge for Yoga
3,2,0,It's not the mat,it's your socks.
4,0,0,You say you're an intermediate to advanced level??
2,3,0,We're not as flexible as you might think.
4,1,0,'Downward Dude' isn't a pose.
4,0,1,You want the Bow Down to Me Yoga class next door.
3,2,0,Bro-ga is at 6:30 *pm*.
5,0,0,You're embarrassing me again! I said that the magic carpet ride was AFTER the yoga session.
5,0,0,Workers Comp Power Yogee meet in the construction studio.
2,3,0,I am impressed. You rolled your own.
2,2,1,So tell me, does Aladdin know you took his carpet?
5,0,0,We don't do mat envy at yoga!
5,0,0,You are going to get carpet burn when we do the Up Dog pose using that thing. Billy's response was "What's Up Dog?"
4,1,0,Downward facing shag rug is not a yoga position.
5,0,0,Overcompensating.
1,2,0,Namaste. But no, you may not stay.
4,0,1,Sorry, I don't care to cut the rug.
4,1,0,No, I would not like to join you on your magic carpet.
4,0,1,I'll bet you drive an SUV too.
6,0,0,You anti-yogite bastard.
5,0,0,This will make yoga great again.
4,1,0,It's just a temporary ban.
4,0,1,Sorry, sir. We don’t allow any manspreading in this class.
4,1,0,I'm sure it is magic, but we are a little more down to earth, here.
4,0,0,Is that dreadful rug an indicator of your political views?
5,0,0,You can't light that up in here.
4,1,0,Let me guess -- you're voting for Trump.
5,0,0,Manspreading is next door.
5,0,0,You can't smoke that in here.
5,0,0,Something in the rug angers our chakras.
5,0,0,Take a deep breath, then tell me what on earth you were thinking.
5,0,0,I don’t care if disallowing an Indian rug is antithetical.
3,2,0,Yes Mr. Trump, I can see your mat is bigger than mine.
5,0,0,Let's just say you have the aura of a Trump supporter!
4,1,0,Thanks for putting the "Brah" in Brahma, Jimmy.
2,1,2,Sorry, we're not that flexible.
4,0,1,Your mantra should be Hoover
4,0,0,I'm very sorry sir but we don't have a first-class section.
5,0,0,It's not that you're wrong...
5,0,0,I'm guessing this is your first yoga class.
3,2,0,Not if it was the last mat on Earth.
5,0,0,Are you looking for the Subway bread factory depository?
3,2,0,No, I’m Jeanie with a J.
4,1,0,Fine, just don't get a rug burn
4,0,0,That better not be my great grandmother's Persian rug that has been passed down for generations!
5,0,0,You needn't compensate here.
5,1,0,Sorry, we don't need it anymore. Thankfully she bowed out.
4,0,0,I thought this was the try outs for Aladdin 2.
4,1,0,'Bow-Wow' carpet exchange is downstairs
5,0,0,Outside.
5,0,0,Since you've joined us, my mat wants to sacrifice what it is for what it could become.
5,0,0,Contrary to popular misinformation, it is not the carpet that transports you.
5,0,0,There you go with your size issues again
2,3,0,This is not a competition.
4,1,0,Bow Down Yoga does not allow positions that would require a mat that size.
5,0,0,We get a lot of you guys in January.
5,0,0,yoga is not a magic carpet ride!
5,0,0,It will be safe on the bicycle rack..
3,0,1,Personal space issues I presume?
5,0,0,I promise to be amazing.
4,1,0,There's no manspreading here.
5,0,0,I ordered a yoga mat, Matt, not a yoga rug.
5,0,0,The sign says, "No baseball caps."
5,0,0,How many times do I have to tell you, Mr. Hotchkiss, that this is not a team activity.
5,0,0,Go south from here down to Lincoln Boulevard, turn west, then three lights later hang a hard right on 12th. Look for the flashing neon sign: "Hooter's Yoga". Have a nice day.
3,1,0,When I said to step up your game, this is not what I meant.
5,0,0,So, what was swept under it?
6,0,0,Feeling beautiful comes from confidence.
2,3,0,That carpet belongs in the reception area.
4,1,0,Aladdin's moved next door.
3,2,1,You can stay but no grunting or high fiving this time.
4,1,0,I am taking my rug and going home!
5,0,0,Thanks, but I think that you ought to try Craigslist.
3,0,1,Extreme Yoga is on Thursday.
5,0,0,There is no official mat nor dress code, per se, but not that rug nor those clothes!
4,1,0,You must be at the wrong place. Man Cave Yoga is 2 blocks over.
5,0,0,It is so brover.
5,0,0,I asked for the memory foam rug not the oriental.
5,0,0,It is required that your mat be decorator approved!
5,0,0,Beginning Yoga starts next week.
5,0,0,Yes, but Aladdin never thought downward dog was a resting position
4,1,0,Yogic Manspreading has been cancelled today.
5,0,0,I bring my own mat, it's hypoallergenic.
4,0,1,Trump Yoga is in the building across the street.
3,2,0,It's lovely, but we'll have to charge you for two spaces.
4,1,0,If you let go of the rug, we will achieve it.
5,0,0,Aladdin just left on another magic carpet.
5,0,0,My downward dog is a Great Dane.
5,0,0,You are not moving in. This is just an hour class!
5,0,0,Men always think it's about size.
4,1,0,Unroll your mum and make your own damn breakfast.
5,0,0,Way too big, and it probably has cooties.
5,0,0,Sorry but you can't get a group discount using that.
5,0,0,Look, Matt, it was just an affectionate nickname.
5,0,0,What do you mean my mat is too big?
5,0,0,You can start by massaging your inner eye.
5,0,0,I admire your initiative, but it's still no towel no workout.
3,2,0,Sorry. We don't allow baseball caps in here.
3,0,2,The rug is fine. It's the Red Sox cap that offends my chakras.
4,1,0,Sorry but to use a 5' x 7' mat you'll need to upgrade to our 'Premium Plan.'
5,0,0,There's no room for manspreading down the eightfold path.
4,1,0,Persian carpet yoga is across the hall.
5,0,0,We can't help you find the rug store that used to be here but we can help you find your center.
4,1,0,You must be looking for the beginning class.
5,0,0,The aerial meditation class is upstairs.
5,0,0,I'm afraid magic won't help you master even the beginning positions.
3,2,0,For the last time, using an Oriental rug does not make it more authentic!
3,2,0,This is my assertive pose.
3,1,1,The 'Make-America-and-Yoga-Great-Again' studio is across the street.
3,1,0,Relax, I'm Muslim
5,0,0,We only admit beginners.
4,0,0,What do you mean my rug and I aren't "simple" enough?
5,0,0,Sorry, but mats with fringes aren't allowed.
5,0,0,No... I will not be your "Jasmine."
5,0,0,No, Kevin, this is the opposite of 'trying.''
5,0,0,I don't care if it was your grandmother's.
4,1,0,Sure I can give you a mantra. Try YMCA.....YMCA.....YMCA.....YMCA
3,1,0,Just make sure you don't set up by the window.
5,0,0,It's not the size of your mat!
5,0,0,Who ordered the Lu Lu Lemon Antique Collection?
5,0,0,We only take plastic.
4,0,1,If your name was Carpet, would you have then brought a mat?
5,0,0,I'll pass on the magic carpet ride.
3,1,0,Yes, we are flexible but....
4,1,0,Namaste not Amen.
5,0,0,Ok, we require proper attire and there's a 'no carpet' rule.
5,0,0,You've got the wrong place you're misappropriating a different culture.
5,0,0,What, you got a real flexible body rolled up in there?
6,0,0,An Oriental rug isn't going to make Yoga any easier!
5,0,0,I don't believe in magic carpets.
5,0,0,I was a boy scout, ma'am.
4,1,0,No, we don't "got any bodies we need disposin' of". But you can leave a flyer on the corkboard, if you wish.
6,0,0,Yes sir, I realize you don’t go anywhere without your ‘ruggie,’ but you really need a yoga mat.
5,0,0,Is Jasmine teaching today's class ?
5,0,0,It's snow big thing.
4,0,0,Sorry to rub your nose in it, but your downward dog needs work.
0,3,1,I don't care whether or not it ties the room together.
4,0,1,I'm sorry the magic carpet class just ended
5,0,0,Why such a big mat? You have a small behind!
5,0,0,You've brought me the wrong mat peasant, be gone.
2,2,1,Just place it down over here by placing your left foot onto your right shoulder.
4,0,0,You're with the movers? The office is straight ahead.
5,0,0,No manspreading here either!
4,0,0,Oh, hi Monty. Did you leave Sasquatch in the car again?
5,0,0,I think your mantra is defective.
3,1,0,Rolling your friend named Matt into a rug was nothing like what we meant when we said bring your own mat.
5,0,0,Sorry, Mr. von Bode is in the 4 o'clock class.
4,1,0,No, this is not where the Spring Break Carpet Contortion Contest is being held.
3,2,0,So what part of 'mats' did you not understand?
4,1,0,I said this week we'd begin Kapotasan not Karastan.
5,0,0,What did you bring to yoga class today, Cleopatra?
4,0,1,Sorry, you're looking for "Dump Your Dead Body Yoga" down the street.
2,3,0,Yes, even if your name is Matt.
5,0,0,Where should I put my area mat?
4,0,0,Since I consider myself the Lance Armstrong of yoga, it's definitely not about the mat.
5,0,0,You'll get to like the hard floor.
5,0,0,Your reluctance to go barefoot tells me you're a newcomer.
4,1,0,Never the less sir,size matters.
4,0,0,We don't allow man spread in our yoga class.
5,0,0,Fine, but next week its 'namaste at home' for you and the rug, Carl
4,1,0,You just don't get it, do you?
5,0,0,Our beginner's class meets in the Second Ave Y. It's three blocks west. If you hurry you won't miss too much.
5,0,0,Wrong workout session, bro...
5,0,0,Is that a Trump yoga mat?
4,0,0,Really, Honey, Size doesn't matter.
6,0,0,Did you want restorative or remedial?
4,1,0,The carpet we can handle. But your outfit... uber non-spiritual.
5,0,0,Wow. You're, like, so authentic.
3,2,0,Even IF your name is Matt...no.
4,1,0,You here for a yoga class or to hide a body?
5,0,0,Take your "Y"oga chromosome, and get your big asana outta here, Buster!
5,0,0,Unfortunately for you one of the jobs I worked during college was stadium security. I'd say 12 beers and 2 bags of chips...?
5,0,0,You haven't seen Cleopatra around either?
5,0,0,Perhaps you're taking this "need my own space" thing too far ?
5,0,0,Okay, you're very rugged. Ha, ha. Now get lost.
4,0,0,No, we don't have a spectator section.
5,0,0,This is Bow Down Yoga Class. Bow Down Agony is next to the out-patient clinic.
1,3,0,Snug as a Bug Yoga is two doors down.
3,1,0,I am afraid your area rug will invade my personal space
4,1,0,And is your whole team going to join you?
4,1,0,And the other reason is because I can see a body rolled up in there.
5,0,0,The rug department is upstairs
5,1,0,I don’t care if it IS a magic carpet.
4,1,0,I don't care if you were snug as a bug in a rug, no one snores in my class!
4,1,0,'Sweat & Fleas Yoga' is down the street. Try there.
5,0,0,Are you planning to extend your yoga positions to three times the usual time?
4,1,0,International Yoga Federation actually approved it
5,0,0,That's good. A rug is better than a yoga mat.
5,0,0,Well, look who the dog drug in.
5,0,0,But I'm a beginner
3,2,0,Oh, yeah? Well, my mat may degrade into tiny pieces of PVC that will block the digestive tracts of wildlife--but at least it didn't cause child laborers to go blind! Namaste.
5,0,0,You're about to learn the 'upward salute' stance.
3,2,0,Yoga is timeless; you are too now.
4,1,0,Stop right there young man! You are not wearing knee-high socks in my yoga studio
4,1,0,Stop calling me Jasmine.
3,1,0,So, are you planning on being here for a while?
3,1,0,You still have small hands.
5,0,0,I don't care if it's from India.
4,0,0,So the only practice you've had is the 7th inning stretch?
5,1,0,Sod off.
5,0,0,Come back when you get your ahankara in check. Namaste.
5,0,0,Persian Yoga is On the Next Block .
4,1,0,Yes, Mr. Johnson, you are a rugged individualist. Now may we begin?
5,0,0,If you want to impress women, next time just do the stretches without grunting
4,0,0,Sorry, Hot Rug Re-Weaving went out of business months ago.
4,1,0,Yoga for Guys Like Us meets next door at Joe's Bar and Grill.
5,0,0,We're not your outfit.
2,2,1,Do you have a note from your wife?
2,2,1,What is it with men and size?
4,0,0,Prepare to share, or the rug will be pulled out from under you.
4,1,0,That isn't the relaxed look we are going for
3,2,0,Actually, size does matter. So does smell.
5,0,0,'You want to ride that thing to Cleveland? That is wrong on so many levels "
3,2,0,Namaste, dude.
4,0,0,You'll never increase your libido wearing those shoes!
5,0,0,Think small.
5,0,0,This is not a floor show.
4,0,1,I'm being inflexible?
6,0,0,If that's shag, I want you in front of everyone.
5,0,0,Overcompensating for something?
6,0,0,Yes, it matches the drapes, but you took those too.
3,2,0,I suggest you try Pilates.
2,3,0,It doesn't need to tie the room together.
5,0,0,What Ivy League school failed to teach you the difference?
4,0,1,Why does everyone here have small, rubbery prayer rugs?
4,0,0,We are not interested in making yoga great again.
5,0,0,By any chance have you seen the movie"Room"?
5,0,0,leave it to you to bring a rug to a yoga class
4,0,1,Have you considered joining our pre-beginners class?
4,0,1,In our world it doesn't matter whose is bigger.
4,1,0,First, we'll need to get the dust mites out of your chakra.
5,0,0,And don't come back until you promise to stop wearing cotton
5,0,0,It won't work, Bozo. I know Sue Ellen is in there.
5,0,0,I don't care if it is a magic carpet; it won't help you with the difficult poses.
4,0,0,No, the UFC practice center is next door.
5,0,0,Sorry, Chow Down Yoga closed.
4,1,0,Only if it's a flying carpet.
3,1,1,This room doesn't need to be "tied together," Walter...
4,0,0,No.....we don't rugs here.
4,0,1,You're taking the 7th-inning stretch way too seriously, Jimmy.
5,0,1,Unfortunately, size matters here.
5,0,0,Sorry...no larger than 4 X 3, one color and no intrusive designs.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but everyone has to come willingly.
5,0,0,Could it be that you are using your yoga mat compensate for the size of your "hands"?
3,2,0,Pardon me, but if you don't have a more traditional yoga mat, get your asana out of here.
5,0,0,and does it have underlay ?
5,0,0,I suggest that you take your Yogi Bear sleeping bag, and your power nap elsewhere.
4,1,0,In yoga, unlike politics, size doesn't matter.
5,0,0,Sorry ---- this is a no frills zone.
4,0,1,Just dump her in the marsh and hurry back. Bikram is at noon and people drop like flies.
5,0,0,Unroll my student and leave before I call the police.
5,1,0,Sorry, flying lessons are next door.
5,0,0,I've recently lost a lot of weight.
6,0,0,Capitalist foo1! Already have missile plans!
4,1,0,Please refrain from howling during downward dog, hissing through cobra or war hoops during warrior.
1,3,1,Namaste, carpet diem
4,1,0,The ultimate yoga wrestling class meets tomorrow.
5,0,0,I think you are looking for the Persian restaurant next door
2,3,0,I think we'd be more comfortable if you took our course online.
3,2,0,Ted, I said you should come here if you were feeling stiff. Not if you wanted to dispose of one.
3,1,0,My name is Ishvara Mahatma, move from this space or prepare to die.
3,2,0,While I appreciate that you have personal space issues, ...
5,0,0,I believe your delivery is for Chow Down Yogurt on 63rd.
4,1,0,I like to spread out.
4,1,0,Rug size doesn't matter here.
4,1,0,"Let's keep to our own mats" doesn't mean you should be so territorial.
4,1,0,If anyone croaks during the downward facing dog, we can just roll 'em up and haul 'em out with one of these.
4,0,1,Oh yeah, I'm going latex-free
4,1,0,The redneck yoga location is by the trailer park.
5,0,0,"Thank you for coming, but beginners' class was yesterday." For the finalists in the issue of March 7, 2016 I wish to submit an honorable mention: Trump's tower looks even bigger from here.
5,0,0,This is the skinny mat session.
5,0,0,My recliner is in the car.
5,0,0,Take a free yoga mat? Namaste with my rug.
4,1,0,No multi-person mats allowed, please.
5,0,0,You can't bring that in here, Doobie.
6,0,0,You're right, sir, Yoga originated in Asia - but your mat is still inappropriate and, frankly, offensive.
5,0,0,I dont know where you can get it cleaned
5,0,0,Students shouting, 'we're not worthy' will be asked to leave.
5,0,0,No, Aladdin doesn't teach here, anymore.
5,0,0,I don't care if he's leading in all the polls, everyone ise the same size mat
3,1,0,This is beginning yoga. We don't have a pathetically clueless yoga class.
5,0,0,I feel at home on the ball field, so I brought a piece of the outfield with me.
5,0,0,I thought you said you did Yoga!
3,2,0,That better be a Tibetan prayer rug...
3,1,0,Sorry, but we do not have any over-sized yoga parking spots here.
5,0,0,Nice reclaimed mat, where'd you get it, your grandmother's house?
4,1,0,The mat is fine. It's your socks.
3,1,0,I'm sorry but your carpet-bombing is really attracting bad energy.
4,0,0,Is that for you or the Ganesha?
4,1,0,I'm beginning to regret inviting you along.
4,0,1,The "Broga" class isn't until 6pm.
3,2,0,Yes, I'm certain this is yoga class, hookah class meets tomorrow night.
4,1,0,Tantric Yoga is on Tuesdays
4,0,0,No, Trump is not a member of this class.
5,0,0,No, we can't turn that into a flying carpet, but we might be able to get it to levitate.
4,0,0,We are a different kind of ashram, sir.
3,2,0,May I suggest the spinning class upstairs?
5,0,0,One's mat is not for carrying one's inner self, Biff.
5,0,0,No sir, we do NOT recognize Downward Facing Mastiff here!
4,1,0,This is not a magic carpet ride
5,0,0,A mat is not a status symbol here.
5,0,0,You must be compensating for something
5,0,0,I don't know where to start.
3,2,0,If that's a flying carpet you better us it now, Wise guy.
5,0,0,This is my Bear rug, from my recent hunting expedition--I'm dedicating my practice to the Bear's spirit.
5,0,0,I don't know... just throw her skinny ass in the East River, or a dumpster. Do I have to do EVERYTHING around here?
4,1,0,Well it smells like a dog crouched on it.
5,0,0,We don't allow rugged types here.
4,1,0,That's Jeannie's mat.
5,0,0,Pee pads would help more with your downward facing dog
3,1,0,Your first pose will be the Dead Man's Stretch.
5,0,0,Aladdin, that outfit doesn't fool anyone
3,2,0,artificial turf? sorry - we stress natural here!
6,0,0,I think you want Aladdin's Studio next door.
3,2,0,Man Down is across the street.
5,0,0,Oh, I'm sorry, Magic Carpet Flow was at 9.
4,1,0,We're seeking a path to enlightenment, not a Hajj.
3,1,1,Can I see your Groupon voucher?
3,1,1,Magic Carpet Studio moved to Brooklyn.
3,1,1,I said I take my purse and a mug, not a Persian rug.
5,0,0,I bow to your wish.
4,1,0,You always did strike me as the rugged type.
5,0,0,No, John, I meant ‘corpse pose’ figuratively.
5,0,0,BYOM stands for mat, not mite infested dusty old throw rug.
4,0,0,You might find Jumpin' Jack's Gym down the street a better fit.
5,0,0,Not here, the magic carpet yoga class is on the roof!
5,0,0,When a bundle of yoga mats falls off the back of a truck, come see me again.
5,0,1,What do you mean your downward dog isn't housebroken?
5,0,0,Shoes off, please.
5,0,0,The idea of yogi is to relax.
5,0,0,Its complicated
4,1,0,But 'home court advantage' does nothing for your practice.
5,0,0,Great…another middle-aged "dude" who thinks my studio needs a rug to tie everything together.
5,0,0,Sure bigger matters. But not in yoga mats.
5,0,0,You ordered a mat?
5,0,0,We focus on silent judging here. Passive agressive yoga is next door.
5,0,0,Irene are you in there ?
4,1,0,That's a bazaar yoga mat.
4,1,0,No, this is hot yoga. Gauche yoga is downstairs.
4,1,0,Let me guess – first time in a yoga studio and you’re here under duress?
5,0,0,We were all moved by The Room, sir, but you really can leave at any time.
4,1,0,Blue collar yoga is upstairs.
4,0,0,Just because always say Namaste doesn't mean you're not in Maya.
3,1,0,Tabriz Yoga is next door
5,0,0,Sorry, we don't have space for someone who wants to use us as a take-off and landing pad.
5,0,0,I'm Kleopatra, not Cleopatra.
5,0,0,I'm on a budget.
5,0,0,I don't care if it's big enough for everyone to share. You still can't get high in the studio.
5,0,0,I'm just not sure you'd fit in.
5,0,0,You might be interested in the thousand session package
4,0,0,I don't care if it's magic, you won't fly through this class.
6,0,0,It's the seventh inning stretch that makes yoga so like baseball.
2,2,1,The bro-ga class was moved to 2:30.
2,2,1,You're lucky I'm flexible.
2,3,0,That's not what I meant.
5,0,0,What did I tell you about holding rugs like that? People might think you're a gun toting terrorist. Or worse... a Republican.
5,0,0,What happens when couples can't agree on an exercise.
3,2,0,I already explained this. No matt, no yoga pants, no yoga.
4,1,0,Let me give you a list of everything you're doing wrong.
5,0,0,No, this is "Bow Down" Yoga --- "F#@K YOU!" Yoga is next door.
4,1,0,Like many things in life, it's not how big it is, it's what you do with it.
5,0,0,What I said was 'we do our yoga exercises on the floor, please bring a rug' but, but.....
4,1,0,You can do corpse pose on a mat you know.
4,1,0,I understand that you own the HUMMER parked outside.
4,1,0,You're sure to really feel the burn with that.
4,1,0,Please leave. We have a strict no shoes policy.
4,1,0,Now would you please unroll, so I might ask her myself why she is against yoga lessons.
5,0,0,Fair trade?
5,0,0,The lotus position on a K-Mart rug cannot release your cosmic aura.
4,1,0,You don't get that much space.
6,0,0,No, man spreading isn't a yoga pose.
5,0,0,Take the elevator to Roof for Magic Carpet Yoga. And in the future, wear a fez or a turban.
5,0,0,Do you lift weights on your carpet?
4,0,0,Is that my delivery of all natural free trade organic yoga mats?
3,2,0,Is there a body in there?
5,0,0,We haven't had a mosque here since the Bush administration.
5,1,0,100% organic cotton makes me being connected with nature.
5,0,0,Aladdin's flying carpet repair shop is two blocks east.
5,0,0,No, hot yoga does not mean you're supposed to get rug burns.
4,0,1,NASCAR yoga is next door.
4,0,0,Yo, broheim - bro-ga is next door.
4,1,0,Do you always carry your personal guru around in there?
3,1,1,First class?
3,0,2,fringe is not allowed
5,0,0,You misheard. They said "Make your thoughts big." Not "Make your THINGS big.
5,0,0,One of my uncles is a Moslem!
5,0,0,The told me that my membership in Magic Carpet Yoga was transferable.
5,0,0,No, Yogi Berra was not a founder and you may take that patch back to right field where you found it.
4,1,0,No, the Persian class was this morning.
5,0,0,You can put Mr. Trump's mat by the window.
4,0,0,This isn't dance class sir. All rugs must be pre-cut.
4,1,0,You are out of place, or we are out of space.
4,0,0,We don't encourage it, but if it makes you feel at home.....
4,1,0,No, there is no best asana for a magic carpet.
5,0,0,Very simply, because vinyl mats have been used for millennia.
3,2,0,I understand; you want more space.
4,0,1,All I said was, "You have small hands."
4,0,1,If there is a boy in there, you'll have to take him back to his room.
5,0,0,I'm cool with the mat, but lose the shoes.
4,1,0,the size of your mat doesn't prove anything. not even Donald Trump could pull off THAT rug!
3,2,0,No, I don't see how this is just like when I washed your Eli Manning jersey on game day, but if it means we can finally move past that, then namaste.
4,0,0,No, this is Bow Down Yoga. Down Cow Yoga’s on E 59th St.
2,2,1,I am going to start with the hat...
5,0,0,We can certainly help with your balance problem.
5,0,0,Take some relaxation breaths...then shell out for the gear.
5,0,0,You were misinformed. This is not a mosque.
4,1,0,The front desk mentioned you had a really bad rug. I misunderstood
3,2,0,I said "Don't stay," not "namaste"
3,1,0,You're early... Persian Yoga begins in an hour.
5,0,0,You can do other things on your rug but not yoga!
5,0,0,Spinning is next door.
6,0,0,I don't know if sun salutations are more effective if you are hovering above ground.
3,1,0,Yes, but only if your inner-self is oriental.
5,0,0,Size doesn't really matter here, Mr. Trump.
3,2,0,You have bad karma, Matt.
4,0,1,Elephant yoga's not til tomorrow.
4,0,0,Are your hands large enough to unroll that thing?
4,1,0,Hookah Yoga is across the street.
5,0,0,Magic later; come back with a yoga mat and then suspension.
2,3,0,The mat is fine. The hat, pants, and socks have to go!
5,0,0,I get it: you're angry with the donor-class Yoga establishment.
3,0,0,Downward dog is not the same as downward mobility.
4,0,0,Make yourself at home, Namaste.
5,0,0,The carpet beater class is next door
4,1,0,Please go ohm.
5,0,0,I don't believe The Donald's ego is enrolled in this class.
2,3,0,You disappoint me, Matt.
4,1,0,I don't care if it is a flying carpet. Take it outside.
3,1,1,No, it's not because you're Muslim...
5,0,0,Just try not to hurt yourself doing supta badhass konasana
5,0,0,Not what I meant by 'feel the burn'.
5,0,0,If you could refrain from shuffling around and zapping the other students next time, that would be great.
3,2,0,I get that you have a very large aura, but we just don't have enough room in here.
5,0,0,Yes, I am delighted to learn your dog would not move her asana and join us.
4,1,0,Costco will always try to sell you more than you need!
4,1,0,That had better be a locally-sourced dead body in there.
4,1,0,I'll never fly.
5,0,0,The flying club is next door.
4,1,0,Put it over there in front of the throne.
4,1,0,I'm sorry. The flying carpet class is on Wednesdays.
5,0,0,I know this is supposed to be a couple's activity, but just pretend you are here alone, ok?
4,0,1,How typically male! Territorial!
3,2,0,Since this is your first time, we'll be flexible.
5,0,0,No, wearing Lululemon is not required, but we are going to think less of you for looking like that.
4,1,0,The size of your Chakra has nothing to do with it!
3,2,0,Because I want you to suffer like the rest of us.
5,0,0,This is the Bow Down Yoga Studio, not The Yogi Bear Show.
5,0,0,When I said that we were going to be be practicing the corpse pose today I didn't mean literally.
4,1,0,A huge mat won't hide your small fingers Donald.
3,2,0,I would have to disagree. There is no such thing as a yoga area rug.
3,2,0,This is a class, not a sleep-over.
4,1,0,Sorry. The do yoga Downton-Abbey-style is on Thursdays.
3,2,0,Most of the other boyfriends just wait outside.
5,0,0,We don't do downward facing jog. And that's a rug.
5,0,0,I ordered a Dharamsala practice rug, not a Jaipur practice rug, you idiot!
6,0,0,The gymnastics class is in the basement.
5,0,0,Sir, yoga is an Asian spiritual tradition, not Oriental.
5,0,0,You are welcome to join, but I must warn you that your membership includes random urine sampling for performance enhancing drugs.
3,1,0,Namaste, but you must go.
4,1,0,You're right, Yoga is an Oriental practice, but...
5,0,0,They were having a rug sale
4,1,0,You forgot the beer.
4,1,0,Maybe you could leave manspreading to the subways?
5,0,0,Don't unravel Cleo until everyone arrives.
5,0,0,So you think this time magic will help?
5,0,0,Nah! Musty
5,0,0,I'm sorry, we're here to create harmony and balance in our minds and bodies, and to break through the oppressive barriers that we face here in the western world. You just don't look like you'll fit in here.
3,2,0,There is no missionary position in Yoga.
4,0,1,Okay, I will go with the rug, but no chewing tobacco.
4,1,0,NO. None of the Poses will make it fly.
5,0,0,No I won't share your mat and I'd prefer it if you set up in front of me.
4,1,0,There is no such thing as team yoga!
5,0,0,As-Salaam-Alaikum
5,0,0,Right here will be fine, thanks. I wasn't sure which mat to bring, so I just thought, why not both?
3,2,0,You can't wear a hat in here.
5,0,0,I need my space
1,4,0,Our ancient practice requires a polypropylene mat.
5,0,0,With the downward dogs, think a little less shaggy, a little more Weimaraner.
5,0,0,Let me guess. You flew in on it.
5,0,0,No baseball caps allowed.
5,0,0,Your third eye must be pretty farsighted.
5,0,0,I'd worry they roll me up during shavasana.
5,0,0,We seek not the size of the roll, but humility of the soul.
1,3,0,Rug's OK - clothes are a no-no.
2,2,0,We bow towards Madison Avenue, not Mecca.
3,1,0,I'm not your little girl & I am not going anywhere with you on some magic carpet ride.
3,1,0,Where's the couch, Rob - how will you enjoy yourself otherwise?
4,1,0,Please tell Governor Christie that though we are excited over his desire to be healthy, only he can reserve his exercise space.
3,2,0,I'm the chick you bow down to here!
4,0,0,Why the shoes?
3,1,1,Your nonconformity does not conform to our nonconformity.
5,0,0,You know, that doesn't compensate for your small hands.
5,0,0,No, I really don't want to go on your magic carpet ride.
5,0,0,I think you want the Persian yoga studio down the street.
4,1,0,If you have to roll your wife in a rug to get her here, her chakras aren't open.
4,0,1,I know a place that can trim that for you.
5,1,0,Put the body over with the others.
4,1,0,Nice to meet you, Big Matt.
4,1,0,If you're from Mr. Trump, the answer is still no.
5,0,0,I was here first!
5,0,0,I see you are keeping it old school with the handwoven yoga mat
2,2,1,Beat it!
4,0,0,Again today you have no class.
5,0,0,Oh Wow Yoga is up the street.
4,1,0,I think you went to the wrong mat store...
5,0,0,The manspreading class is down the hall.
3,1,1,That would be the flat-weave position.
3,2,0,If you’re looking for the Flying Carpet Yoga School, take the elevator to the top floor.
5,0,0,At least tell me its an indoor rug.
5,0,0,I don't care if that's how they did it in Persia.
6,0,0,This will give new meaning to rug burn.
5,0,0,I told you comfort in this class is relative.
5,0,0,Vegan mats only.
4,0,0,honey, this is not the right place to pitch your ideas
4,0,0,Mi casa su vinyasa.
5,0,0,It doesn't matter if you're Turkish, you still have to use a mat.
5,0,0,"If it don't fit, you must split".
4,1,0,You must be from Texas. Yippee.
5,0,0,Your bath towel would have been sufficient.
6,0,0,You got a lot of swag.
4,0,0,The "Aladdin" auditions are next door.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, sir, but the management asks that we reserve all superiority complexes for the Republican debates.
5,0,0,Your here to do yoga not lay down carpet.
3,1,1,The light in me honors the clueless in you. Namaste.
5,0,0,This is the third time this week. This isn't the carpet store.
3,1,0,Bigger isn't necessarily better.
4,0,1,That's made of sheep, right? This is a vegan studio.
5,0,0,That’s a flying carpet. We use mats.
4,1,0,Yes, you brought a large mat, but you still have to take your shoes off.
5,0,0,Our Flea-Reincarnation Class meets on Thursdays.
4,1,0,If anyone asks, it's 100% all natural.
6,0,0,There's no such thing as a 'family' size mat.
4,1,0,Sorry, we don't do rug appraisals.
4,1,0,Are you seeking health & a peaceful spirit or the rug cleaner next door ?
4,0,1,Actually, John, your seven chakras don't want seventeen square feet.
4,0,0,I assume the dead, rotting corpse of our marriage is rolled up in that carpet?
3,1,0,Of course you may work in the teachings of your Afghan yogi, but it's still 14 dollars a lesson.
4,0,0,The flying carpet studio is one flight up. Is that an Air Loom?
5,0,0,What part of "middle aged white guys need not apply" did you not understand?
4,1,0,Your passive-aggressive schtick is wearing thin. Please go home and make dinner for the kids, okay?
5,0,0,Sure, you can chant Yogisms during class.
3,2,0,I see its a rug. I'd still prefer you to say 'Asian'.
5,0,0,You don't need to compensate for your small hands here Mr. Trump
5,0,0,This is your problem Dave..you always have to be different.
5,0,0,I said a Yoga mat, not a vulgar mat
5,0,0,Oh, come on! I don't smell that bad!
1,4,0,Is this your first class?
5,0,0,I don't care what your interior decorator says even if she is your mom.
5,0,0,Yes, Brian. Yoga pants are really tight. And no. I'd prefer not sharing your 'really big mat'.
4,1,0,Yes, I can see you have a big one.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, that is not a yoga mat. That is not even a tatami mat. That is an area rug.
5,0,0,Do you take a couch to a baseball game?
5,0,0,...I almost had to bow on a borrowed mat.
4,1,0,Just set yourself up everywhere.
4,1,0,This is Yoga class, not Yoda class.
4,1,0,It smells like your dog has been doing more than downward facing on that thing.
5,0,0,...and I TOLD your wife NOT to try that pose at home.
3,1,1,Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm...
4,1,0,When you asked on the phone if you could wear a rug to class, I assumed you meant a toupee!
4,0,1,Kevin's Rug Cleaning? Two doors down!
3,2,0,Shoes not allowed.
3,1,1,Please understand there will be a $25 excess baggage fee.
3,1,1,I'm sure you'd be more comfortable at our sister studio: Bro Down Yoga.
4,0,1,Sorry but we do not offer 'super size me' yoga
5,0,0,We've never had rug burns raised as a concern before.
5,0,0,Your Anger Management Counselor warned us, you'd be coming.
4,1,0,"I guess this is where East meets America".
4,1,0,Aladdin, you can park your magic carpet outside and come join us.
4,0,0,Are you trying to compensate for something?
4,1,0,Wait, don't tell me: the dog ate your mat?
3,2,0,The Yoga for Dummies class starts at noon.
5,0,0,At least the stunt at crossfit had some edge.
3,2,0,That's what happens when you buy your mat from Craigslist.
5,0,0,Is that Lululemon?
5,0,0,I told you: hot water and hot dryer.
5,0,0,Nooo, by rugged we meant like determination and toughness to get through this free week-long trial yoga class.
4,0,0,I thought that an Oriental rug would be more authentic
4,1,0,Maybe, Billy, if you used a yoga mat like the rest of us you'd be less inclined to soil it during Downward Dog
4,0,0,This isn't Colorado.
3,1,0,We don't allow wool mats in our vegan studio.
3,2,0,No, I'm pretty sure all of the hotties have their own mats.
3,1,0,That's not what I meant when I told Aladdin to bring his own mat.
3,1,0,Please lose the mattitude.
5,0,0,This is "Bow Down Yoga". The "Moving Man Yoga" is next door
3,1,0,And also, there's those socks.
5,0,0,A. Your not the maharaja. B. That's not his mat. C. Hang it on a line. And D. Beat it!
4,1,0,I swear it's just yoga, not flying carpet lessons.
5,0,0,A magic mat, you say? Can I use it to get fit without exerting myself?
2,2,0,You're definitely going to feel the burn.
5,0,0,No…its not just because you're "for Donald Trump".
6,0,0,This class is not for posers
4,1,0,The 'yoga for dummies' class is meeting in the back room today.
4,0,0,The Instructor will no longer judge your warrior 2 pose...
5,0,0,Sorry, it's Yoga Yogi. You made a Boo Boo.
5,0,0,We don't accept old sods
5,0,0,Unfortunately, nobody here goes by Jasmine!
3,1,1,If she's actually dead, I don't think yoga can help.
1,2,1,Sir, your wife wasn't finished meditating.
5,0,0,Flying carpets are not allowed.
3,2,0,I'm sorry, this studio doesn't allow manspreading.
5,0,0,I'd love to make this a team sport on your mat.
5,0,0,Spilling grape juice on your rug does not qualify it as a sticky mat.
5,0,0,Carpet burn yoga...that's down the hall, second door on the right.
5,0,0,NO PRAYING
5,0,0,I'm sensitive to your ethnic roots but it's irrelevant that Ali Baba flew around on this. It's just not a yoga mat.
4,0,0,Unless there is a more limber body in there, you can leave.
5,0,0,We're more about how good you look getting fit; not actually getting fit.
5,0,0,Yes, I am flexible, but 'Beer Tuesday' is not going to happen.
4,0,0,Here at Bow Down Yoga, we don't encourage glorifying our mats.
6,0,0,This is a traditional Yoga studio. Polyvinyl Chloride mats only.
5,0,0,Outside it might be different, inside yoga mats are politically indifferent.
4,1,0,I hear you're the best there is...
4,1,0,Yes, I'd say it was an impressive flying pigeon Mr. Aladdin.
4,1,0,Fine. I get it. Size doesn't matter.
5,0,0,Your third eye chakra won't be spinning properly using that yoga mat.
5,0,0,Runners Beyond Hope isn't a class per se, it's more of a gathering across the hall with a big mirror.
4,0,1,She held the Kapotasana pose too long. The body's in the small studio.
5,0,0,You'll have to come back tomorrow, Ms. Antoinette just called in sick.
3,2,0,The magic carpet class is 2 doors down.
4,1,0,Calling it a ‘chakrug’ doesn’t help any.
5,0,0,I'm certain your grandmother hadn't intended this when she asked you to have it steam cleaned.
5,0,0,What cha got there? Gonna take a magic carpet ride?
3,2,0,I specialize in oriental yoga.
5,0,0,I hope you enjoy getting rug burn
2,2,1,Blue collar yoga is Thursday night.
2,2,1,Bet you bring a typewriter to Starbucks too.
5,0,0,Well Mister Enjoys Yoga and Long Walks on the Beach, there's no Kathy here.
4,1,0,Unroll that filthy thing in here, and I'll see to it you don't get up from your downward dog! Namaste.
5,0,0,No Al I don't trust you.
5,0,0,Namaste, Adam.... you are embarrassing me...
5,1,0,Even when you try to do things I love you irritate me.
4,0,0,No, you can just use a regular mat for High Flying Dragon.
4,1,0,No, we do not do sleepovers.
4,1,0,Are you looking for Trump Magic Carpet Riding School? Next studio over.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but here less is more.
5,0,0,I should have had the carpet delivered to my house.
2,2,1,Put her back.
5,0,0,I assume you are new at this.
4,1,0,Interior decorating is in the next building over.
4,0,0,Yes, it's because of my wool allergy - well derrrr
3,2,0,It's not the size of your mat but the depth of your dog.
5,0,0,You're obviously compensating for something.
2,3,0,Yoga for the Tragically Unenlightened is next door.
5,0,0,Global warming is coming, so l'm striking while l can.
4,0,0,We have loaner mats. You can't bring your blankee.
4,0,1,I think the room is already tied together just fine, thank you.
4,0,1,I said, “One mat per person, not Persian!”
5,0,0,Sure, we can cure your backache.
3,1,0,Sorry, man spreading is strictly prohibited.
6,0,0,FYI this is a yoga class.
5,0,0,What do you have in there....Cleopatra?
4,0,1,I'm going to go ahead and assume this is your first yoga class.
3,1,0,I love the new yoga line for men.
5,0,0,I voted for Donald Trump
4,1,0,I understand you perspire a lot.
5,1,0,That's not my area.
5,0,0,You know what they say about men who carry big mats
5,0,0,You have small hands
4,1,0,Looks like you have a solid home practice going.
5,0,0,It might be a little ticklish at the end.
3,2,0,I don't care if it's magic, there are no shortcuts to enlightenment.
4,1,0,It's not about the size of your mat.
5,0,0,What makes you think a comfortable rug will help you find your Karma?
5,0,0,Gear may BE overrated, but really!--the lobby runner?
3,1,1,Sorry, no manspreading allowed.
4,0,0,"IMats here rugs/.carpet/home.
5,0,0,Nama-DON'T stay...
5,0,0,Girl: " What are you even doing?" Boy: "Yoga!"
5,0,0,Is your exercise buddy in there?
4,0,1,I suggest you use a mat that's not older than yoga.
4,1,0,No, the flying carpet class is down the hall.
3,1,0,Fine, let's do fewer things together.
4,1,0,Seat's taken...
5,0,0,Yoga in 'Merica
5,0,0,Sorry sir, our insurance doesn't cover carpet burns.
5,0,0,You can stretch the full length?
5,0,0,Sir, you are here blatantly for the yoga pants.
4,0,0,The 'Yoga for Beginners' class meets down the hall.
5,0,0,Your dating profile said: "Yoga Master."
4,0,0,I think you meant to deliver that to the hot yoga studio down the street.
4,0,0,Your nap-time will be scheduled after you finish your milk and cookies.
5,0,0,I see you've mastered the corpse pose
3,1,1,Put the instructor back. . .now.
4,0,0,Sorry, you just missed our Rugrats class.
3,1,0,Is she in your mat practicing the corpse pose?
5,0,0,Sir , It's Bow Down not Bedouin Yoga .
3,2,0,The hat isn't the problem.
5,0,0,I don't care what its street value is, that's not what we mean by 'hot yoga.'
5,0,0,This is a magic carpet...all who share it will fly through yoga....guaranteed!
3,1,0,By yoga mats, we don't really mean actual mats!
5,0,0,this is yoga, not carpet weaving
5,0,0,I'm here to do floor work.
4,1,0,Don't worry, Afghans are welcome here.
5,0,0,I'm afraid to say this is 816 Oak Avenue, not 816 Oak Street.
2,3,0,New here?
5,0,0,No, the flyer stated free 'Spring Fling Yoga Class', not "Free Spring Training Yoga Class'.
3,1,1,I keep telling you, it's not about how big it is.
4,1,0,Overcompensating much?
5,0,0,I ORDERED A 2' BY 4', NOT AN 8' BY 10'
4,0,0,I'm sorry, but we cannot accept any more new students as the class is full.
5,0,0,Just like a guy. You have to have the biggest one.
3,2,0,Let me guess, you have a coupon.
1,1,2,Sorry, sir. We don't allow...hats.
4,1,0,Nice rug, but your outfit stinks.
5,0,0,I'm going to give you an amazing discount coupon at Lulumon.
5,0,0,Yes, size does matter in Yoga, but lose the rug!
2,3,0,Put that back in the lobby - then go home.
5,0,0,...and my name is Princess Jasmine but it's still too big!
4,1,0,I have to ask you to leave... mat intimidation is not allowed here.
3,1,1,Western yoga is next door.
4,1,0,Well, yoga CAN be a magic carpet ride.
5,0,0,I'm old school
4,1,0,We're flexible here but not that flexible.
4,1,0,And another thing. Stop singing "Om, Om I'm deranged."
4,2,0,"Remnants only!
5,0,0,I'm sorry, as a standing rule we generally don't let our students use carpet tacks or glue for enhanced traction, but we'll take the use of duct tape under advisement.
3,1,1,We don't need carpet braggers!
3,0,1,The flight school is down the hall.
4,0,0,And I suppose your partner is on a role, too
4,1,0,Don't be embarrassed, we'll say it's a luxury model.
2,2,0,Stretch or Fly?
5,0,0,Outside! And take that dirty rug and smirk with you
5,0,0,I'm not sure this is what they meant by "stick to the minimum amount."
5,0,0,The bro-ga class meets on Tuesdays.
5,0,0,I don't care if it is a 'magical carpet', it stinks!
5,0,0,Do you just carry that around town so everyone knows you're a professional mover?
4,1,0,We don't allow man-spreading here.
5,0,0,I said "Namaste" not "No mats stay."
5,0,0,Fly home on your magic carpet, and don't come back without a yoga mat.
5,0,0,It's not the size of the mat that's important. It's how you use it.
6,0,0,Please don't bring it again. It smells like one too many downward dogs.
4,1,0,We have to stop meeting like this
5,0,0,Will you be meditating or flying today, sir?
4,1,1,Extreme Yoga is next door.
5,0,0,Sorry, yoga is not a competition sport and a bigger mat doesn't help.
3,1,1,You're the third guy this week who's told me, "It really ties the room together."
5,0,0,A 'yoga mat on steroids' may miss the point.
5,0,0,"Carpetbagger" is written all over you.
3,2,0,Please stop trying to 'Make Yoga Great Again'
4,0,0,Love it-but not the right size. Can you cut it, re-dye it, lower the price by 50% and deliver to my home for free?
4,0,1,You'll have to pay for two.
5,0,0,Is this the place for bowing training?
5,0,0,No Matt, as a matter of fact, a rug is not acceptable as a substitute for a mat. How about that!
4,0,0,Thanks for leaving the beer keg outside.
5,0,0,You are not making me 'Home Goods happy.'
3,0,1,This is not your grandmother's yoga class.
3,1,0,'Last time you were here we had to replace the floor. Namaste!'
5,0,0,It's okay as long as you can take everyone in the class to A Whole New World.
3,2,0,It's your first time. I'll be gentle.
5,0,0,magic carpets don't work here
5,0,0,This is what you called a mat!
4,1,0,"World's Biggest Splif" Contest? Down the street.
3,1,0,I'm going old school
6,0,0,Namaste and chill later?
5,0,0,Namaste! I feel that it's karma that brought you to the?? Namaste! I believe it was karma that you found us through our latest groupon offer.
2,1,2,Namaste. And, I suppose, Boo-yah!'
5,0,0,No, a yoga mat. Not a flying carpet.
4,1,0,I don't care if you DO have Cleopatra rolled up inside!
3,2,0,It's not a competition, Larry.
4,0,1,Once again Jerry mistakenly assumed that Carla actually wanted him to solve her problem.
6,0,0,Magic carpets are not allowed!
4,0,0,No one wants to hang at your pad.
3,1,0,Sorry -- this is the low-impact class.
4,1,0,No! I don't want to share your rug.
5,0,0,Fine, as long as it's Tibetan.
4,1,0,There's no magic carpet ride in yoga.
4,0,0,Sorry, there's a bigger class on Tuesdays. And were having small retreats on the weekends...if you have a placemat feel free to join.
5,0,0,You gonna take your big rug 'n leave?" "Nah, 'ma stay
4,1,0,You're a little too hipster to participate
5,0,0,You are in the wrong place. The flying carpet studio is on the roof.
5,1,0,I can see you're new to this class.
6,0,0,That's not what Persian yoga means.
4,1,0,We use yoga mats. Try the local Mosque.
5,0,0,I thought your kind was open-minded.
5,0,0,Sorry - we have a magic carpet ban.
5,0,0,I'm concerned it might make some of the men feel inadequate.
3,1,0,We don't currently offer any classes in manspreading.
4,1,0,O.K., Aladdin. Fly away home.
5,0,0,I'm sorry - we don't have a family group rate.
4,0,1,Trump Yoga is upstairs.
3,1,1,This is hot yoga, they just finished Bro - Yoga.
5,0,0,Donald, I wasn't questioning your size.
4,1,0,Perhaps Broga Yoga isn't for you, "Bro."
3,2,0,Cleopatra, I presume?
5,0,0,The Blue Collar Yoga Tour is two doors down.
4,0,1,I don't care if it flies--you still owe the walk-in.
5,0,0,Exactly, how many of you, are there?
4,1,0,Is your downward dog a Great Dane?
5,0,0,You're here for a class. You're not entertaining.
3,2,0,The flying carpet studio is next door.
4,0,1,Gender equality hasn't trickled down all the way.
5,0,0,Your choice, but real men use foam.
4,0,0,You were asked to bring a mat for Yoga, not a rug for sleeping.
3,1,1,The Downward Mobility class meets on Tuesdays.
5,0,0,I hope you didnt bring our downward facing dog too?
4,0,1,You seem Old School.
4,1,0,I don't care if your dad is a rug dealer.
2,3,0,That'll never fly.
5,0,0,The La-Z-Boy class is in studio 2.
3,1,1,I'm sorry but you can't take naps here anymore.
4,0,0,I'm sorry - we don't accept posers
4,0,1,Orientalism? Yes. Oriental rug? No.
4,1,0,You should try broga instead. I hear it's rugged.
5,0,0,Can we start now, or do we need to make more concessions to your masculinity?
5,0,0,You do look like a rugged individualist, I'll say that!
4,0,0,Trump is not welcomed here.
5,0,0,Will you feel comfortable with our approach to yoga?
4,0,1,We only serve poseurs.
4,0,0,No, you were misinformed. We don't do industrial yoga here.
2,2,0,Have you considered Bubba Jain Yoga down the street?
5,0,0,Mandy never believed in love at first sight; she had only gone to class to stretch and relax, but she was completely intrigued and smitten with Steve's concept of wall to wall yoga.
3,2,0,Those mats are problematic. They tend to fly away.
5,0,0,We don't learn how to fly in the first class, Aladdin
3,1,0,Who's at home with the kids?
5,0,0,You're going to need a smaller mat.
4,0,0,Perhaps you'd like a partner...or two..?
4,1,0,Does the carpet match the drapes?
4,1,0,Sorry you misunderstood Matt.
5,1,0,I think you're over compensating.
4,1,0,No, we don't keep score.
5,0,0,Are you rolling out the fella who 'bowed down' too much?!
5,0,0,Does your life coach know anything about yoga?
5,0,0,No Babu, the flying carpet class is on Thursdays
3,1,0,We're pretty flexible here.
5,0,0,Why?! Because this yoga is about bowing down to your inner self, not everyone in your neighborhood!
5,0,0,Are you Alladin Sane?
5,0,0,It's not just the size that counts.
5,0,0,Lululemon?
5,0,0,Down your dog, why don't you?
5,0,0,Don't worry Governor Christie, it gets easier with practice.
3,2,0,I'm sure Mr. Berra would be touched by your tribute.
2,3,0,We're more California than Oriental.
4,2,0,Only if you can make it fly.
5,0,0,It’s not a question of "roominess", sir. We simply do not give group discounts.
5,0,0,No, I said I wanted to shift body fat, not a body!
4,1,0,What? I sweat a lot, the rugs more absorbant
3,2,0,There's a ten dollar oversize fee.
4,1,0,Orientals are no longer PC sir.
3,1,1,Is this your first time?
4,1,0,Where's your mat towel, and your yoga-specific clothes, and your water bottle, and are you breathing through your nose?
4,0,1,Texas yoga is one floor up.
3,1,0,"Wall to Wall Yoga" is down the block.
5,0,0,I couldn't fit into my wife's yoga pants.
3,2,0,I'm guessing you haven't been here before.
4,1,0,Upward- or downward-facing?
5,0,0,They're laying sod next door.
6,0,0,A natural mat was not a requirement
5,0,0,No I am sorry but we can't make your rug fly.
5,0,0,Here we are all about style over substance.
4,1,0,Persian Yoga is two floors down.
5,0,0,You'll have to pay for two spots with that rug.
5,0,0,You don't need to bring sod for your downwards dog.
4,0,0,You must be the new bro-ga instructor.
4,0,0,Sorry, Aladdin, this is strictly a mat class.
5,0,0,Where's the yoga party?
4,1,0,...It's vintage.
2,0,2,I take that you aren't here for the yoga class
4,1,0,Stop overcompensating.
5,0,0,You know I won't take my shoes off unless I am home. . .
5,0,0,Okay, okay, I'll stop calling you "Yoga Matt".
3,3,0,That will be useful for when you pass out and we have to move you.
5,0,0,I cannot accept deliveries for anyone named "Genie".
2,3,0,I didn't say it had to be YUUUGE.
5,0,0,I'm sorry. What do you mean by "eminent domain"?
5,0,0,Yoga me this, Yoga me that. Just yoga me a proper size mat.
3,0,1,Man! You really went full out on your yoga mat!
4,0,1,I appreciate your effort, but you still can’t date my daughter.
5,0,0,We appreciate your initiative Bill, we really do but...
2,3,0,Those are the rules, and they're NOT flexible.
5,0,0,Only mats, no carpets please!
5,0,0,Oh, you'll feel the burn alright.
3,1,0,The magic carpet class has been canceled.
3,2,0,Welcome!
5,0,0,Was that a direct carpet ride, or did you have to change in D.C?
5,0,0,It loosens up my downward facing dog.
5,0,0,You say 'authentic'; I say 'hygiene'.
5,0,0,Look, I told you last week, Aladdin doesn't teach here anymore.
3,1,1,Sorry, that won't fly!
5,0,0,No, Bob, I don't think there's room for both of us on your mother's Persian.
5,0,0,I don't care if your name is Matt, that's still just a rug.
3,1,0,I think this place is getting too flexible.
4,1,0,Sorry for the typo - but there's no such thing as pot yoga.
5,0,0,When you told the class you were at outlier, I had something else in mind.
5,0,0,If, as you say, this is a magic carpet, then it's not a yoga mat, is it?
5,0,0,I brought my mother. She's very stiff.
3,1,1,"Magic Carpet Yoga" is across the street
4,0,1,hey bro
5,0,0,I see the hairy man brought a furry rug.
4,0,0,We all know you supported the Iran deal. But isn't this taking things a bit far?
4,0,0,I haven't changed as much as you've stood still.
4,1,0,What do you mean, your regular mat is at the cleaners?
5,0,0,Oh, the levitation class starts next week...
4,1,0,No, Steve, The Room wasn't a funny movie. Put Johnny down and go home, you're embarrassing me.
4,1,0,It's yoga mat... not yoga rug. You'll have to leave.
5,0,0,I knew the Iran deal was a mistake.
4,1,0,You can use it as long as your mother is ok with it.
5,0,0,Actually, it's the hat that worries me...
5,0,0,Living in the past? Shag rug is so 80's!
6,0,0,I've told you, its not all about the size of the mat
3,2,0,No carpets allowed. Try fringe yoga down the street.
4,1,0,This ain't your grandma's yoga, please don't bring your grandma's mat.
6,0,0,Planning on staying a while?
4,0,0,I am sorry sir, this is "Bow Down Yoga", not "Bow Down to Yoda".
3,1,1,That's a stretch.
5,0,0,Yo - GUH. Not Yo-gi.
4,0,0,Remember: no barking in downward dog pose.
3,2,0,Size doesn't really matter
4,1,0,We do not have an oversized locker.
5,0,0,No, I said it wouldn't be picnic.
6,0,0,I don't care if Mrs Palin's been rolled up for hours Mr Trump's office is upstairs.
5,0,0,The lodge is next door!!
4,0,1,I meant finding your comfort zone in the spiritual sense.
4,0,0,You must have learned yoga in California.
3,1,1,What it is it with men and their obsession with size?
5,0,0,A tatami, not an Afghan!
4,1,0,I'm guessing it's been a while since your last class.
4,1,0,Not a prayer.
4,0,1,Even my inner voice is screaming to tell you, get the hell out of here, and take that flea invested rug with you. Namaste.
5,0,0,Are you sure you've never taken a yoga class before? That Lotus Pose looked pretty good.
3,2,0,That's not the usual workout rug, but we're flexible.
4,1,0,You're looking for Man Cave Yoga next door.
4,1,0,We currently do not offer a family plan.
4,1,0,"Artisanal Yoga" is not a thing.
5,0,0,Size matters and it's too big.
4,1,0,I told you, extreme yoga isn't what we do.
5,0,0,Naw-Maw-Stay and get your number?
4,1,0,There's still 2 months left on our lease.
4,1,0,Normally we use smaller mats, but I'm flexible.
2,2,0,Hi Phillip, our Ashtanga economy plus class only meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
4,1,0,Perhaps you'd consider our flight school instead.
5,0,0,Just say no to rugs.
5,0,0,A little trouble with your downward facing dog again, Robert?
4,1,0,We all deserve our own space, just not the entire room!
4,0,0,Elephant yoga? That's two doors down
4,1,0,It's our conference table.
4,0,1,Can't wait to see your water bottle.
5,0,0,That's not the kind of magic carpet ride I meant.
4,0,0,What's with the cap?
4,1,0,We free our minds and soar. There's no flying.
4,0,1,I'm guessing you can really, 'cut a rug'!
5,0,0,That's 'Oriental.' You're gonna need something more 'Orientalist.'
4,1,0,Sit your asana down, and we'll get started.
4,1,0,An ancient Indian practice in a modern American studio is diversity enough!
5,0,0,One person, one mat!
5,0,0,Abandon Magic Carpet, All Ye Who Enter Here- you missed the fine print, Mr. Nudgniak?
3,0,0,You must be from Texas..
5,0,0,We're not very territorial around here.
5,0,0,Oriental yoga is down the hall.
4,0,0,The 70's shag remnant is safe but the tube socks have to go !
3,2,0,Ever heard of rug burn?
3,0,1,I know it's large, but it also is my transportation.
4,1,0,Don't tell me you scheduled our date on your lunch break.
5,0,0,Footwear needs to be left at the door.
4,1,0,We are all-accepting and all-loving, and you're not in uniform.
5,0,0,So you're still mad me for showing up with that wicker basket at your game last week?
4,1,0,You know, we do more than just 'abide' in this class, don't you?
5,0,0,Hopefully, this week when you unroll your mat, a body won't tumble out again.
5,0,0,They told me I could park in here?
4,0,0,Donald, bigger isn't always better.
5,0,0,Your wife told me you'd need some help for your first class.
3,1,1,it's not the size that counts. It's how you use it.
4,0,0,You'll never find the jewel in the lotus with that attitude.
5,0,0,I know downward dog makes you feel stupid. But rolling up your rug and going home isn't going to help your balance.
5,0,0,Mr. Trump's session will be in Studio "B"
5,0,0,Deliveries in the rear plebian.
5,0,0,That's not a real Yogi's mat!
5,0,0,Will you be facing East?
4,1,0,I'm sorry John. I don't think we'll work out.
5,0,0,Meditation is never soft.
3,2,0,Personal yoga mat style is not a constitutional right.
5,0,0,I don't care who wove it, next week you will bring a flimsy, uncomfortable mat made in China from non-renewable resources.
4,0,0,sir , your truck balls are double-parked
6,0,0,'Roll up Yoga' is down the block.
5,0,0,My "inner self" weighs 350 lbs.
4,1,0,Downward-Dog-Rubbing-Butt is really more of a Kundalini move.
5,0,0,Finding your chakra is not about going big or going home.
4,0,0,It's not a place to have a picnic!!
4,0,0,Pffft...that is hardly a yoga mat. Perhaps that thick, loud rug is meant for the CrossFit upstairs?
5,0,0,Look Matt, I told you to you could come stag. Not bring a shag.
4,1,0,We voted to allow the rug, but not the coffee table.
5,0,0,the heavy mat won't aid enlightenment
5,0,0,Mr. Trump, are you seriously expecting us to bow down to you?
5,0,0,Because man-spreading.
5,0,0,I see you bought the azodicarbonamide-free mat
1,3,0,We're pretentious, not ostentatious.
5,0,0,I don't think you understand how a group class works.
4,1,0,Yes, I did say yoga could be magical, but you won't be needing that carpet.
4,0,1,Unless it's Cleopatra inside there, she'll have to pay.
5,0,0,... And please take your shoes off!
4,1,0,In yoga size doesn't matter.
5,0,0,I really don't care that you flew here on that magic carpet - it is too big to use as a mat in my class.
5,0,0,Um, this is a tassel-free zone.
3,2,0,Well, it's better than last week's sleeping bag.
3,1,0,No, I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the 'Reclining Chair' position.
5,0,0,Want to stretch the kinks out?
3,1,1,I'm surprised you didn't bring a pillow.
5,0,0,As you can see, there's a large difference between a rug and a mat.
4,1,0,Actually we all like to roll our own as well.
4,1,0,I think you are a little lost. The ballet studio is next door
4,0,0,So, is it true what they say about men with big carpets?
4,1,0,I'm getting a strong feeling you exaggerated a bit on Match Chat.
2,3,0,Groupon?
4,1,0,I'm afraid your yoga mat is not uncomfortable enough.
5,0,0,I hope your downward dog is housebroken?
5,0,0,No. I'm sorry. It doesn't mean we bow down to you, guy.
5,0,0,Put the rug back in the hall and use one of the Bow Down Yoga PMS 377C colored mats.
5,1,0,I hope this is the new rug for my office.
6,0,0,We don't permit ohm decorating.
5,0,0,Ok wise guy. Is it for Alladin or yoga bear.
5,0,0,Is this some kind of strange nod to Brie Larson?
5,0,0,All due respect, ma'am, you said to bring your own mat or carpet to suit our comfort... You see, in football, grass IS our mat and where my boys are most comfortable , and we'll go to any lengths to win, even yoga - so where do ya want us to lay it?
5,0,0,This is a non-hipster yoga studio.
4,1,0,Tell your employer Mr. Trump: you're not going to convince anyone of your respect for yoga by spending $18,000 on a mat.
5,0,0,You look totally rugged out!
4,1,0,I'm sorry sir but there is no Downward Manspread in Kripalu.
5,0,0,This happens more often than you'd think. But it's 'Bikram,' not 'big rug.'
4,1,0,Thank you for cleaning the downward dog mat.
3,1,0,I could use a good nap.
2,2,1,Sorry, but President Trump has banned all Middle Eastern rugs entering yoga studios.
4,1,0,The light in me sees the strobe in you.
3,1,0,You know, the bigger the mat, the smaller the.......
3,1,1,Harold, this is just one of the many reasons we've got to break it off.
5,0,0,I don't care if you perform better on the home turf. Leave it at home.
4,1,0,Get the hell outta here!
4,1,0,Yes, we are welcoming, and I'm sorry your parents kicked you out. But, no, you can't move in.
4,0,0,I don't think it will tie this room together.
5,0,0,Naps are over in 'Kiddie-Kare,' Rug Boy
4,1,0,No. I don't want to see the drapes.
3,1,0,There's no manspreading in this class!
5,1,0,Sorry, your mat is not synthetic enough.
5,0,0,This is an indoor activity where we meditate, not laying sod in the dirt for a baseball game.
4,1,0,Yes - That's Donald Trump's Yoga Mat
4,0,1,Your magic carpet doesn't work in an exercise class.
4,1,0,The carpet and genie are fine, but the monkey is a major distraction.
5,0,0,Breathe, Donald, breathe. I never said you had small hands.
3,1,0,Always under the impression that bigger is better, right Roger?
5,0,0,I think you're looking for Man Spread Yoga over on 10th Avenue.
4,1,0,We decided to start a yoga studio instead of buying a Persian rug
4,1,0,I think Mr. Trump's class is across the hall.
5,1,0,First Yoga, then we get rid of the body.
3,1,1,No, I ordered yoga mats, not fine quality oriental rugs. I can see how that would be confusing.
5,0,0,Think that will be "big" enough for you?
4,1,0,...do I need to take my shoes off?
3,0,0,'Maximizing your footprint' is a great bro goal, but I don't know that it works for yoga.
5,0,0,That's not exactly what we were talking about when we said let's "Feel the Bern" for today's yoga class.
4,0,0,Sorry. No group discounts.
2,1,0,Sorry, we don't permit manspreading here.
4,1,1,Bro-ga doesn't start until 10.
5,0,0,With whom did you consult regarding your new yoga mat?
4,0,0,Yogi Berra? He must be at another ashram.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, Bro-ga is next door.
5,0,0,No, I will not 'trade you.'
3,2,0,When your foot's behind your head, no one notices what you're sitting on.
5,0,0,Okay Aladdin, show me your stuff......
5,0,0,Does that look like a yoga mat to you?????
5,0,0,Bro-ga is next door.
6,0,0,You should have namastayed at home.
3,1,1,It's not about the rug, Lance.
4,1,0,No, It's not civil rights issue, we just don't allow Afghans.
4,1,0,I said you 'may not stay'—not 'namaste.'
5,0,0,Trust me, your body just won't relax on something so plush.
3,0,2,Hey there Aladdin. Here to see a whole new world?
5,1,0,Let me guess. You've been reading the 'Tips' column in Maxim.
4,1,0,The flying carpet class is next door.
5,0,0,Bow Wow Rug Repair is downstairs.
3,1,1,Sorry. No natural fibers are allowed.
3,1,1,Where do I begin?
5,0,0,I said we would feel the warmth from the heart, not hearth.
4,1,0,Broga?
4,1,0,"We don't give flying lessons here!'
4,1,0,You can stay, but no more talking about CrossFit.
4,0,0,"Aladdin Who sent you?"'
4,1,0,... and another thing, the appropriate greeting is 'Namaste', not 'Animosity'.
4,1,0,This is my turf, back off.
5,0,0,Make yourself at home, but don't make it your home.
5,0,0,Get real!
3,1,0,I said "bring your own mat," not "bring your home mat"
3,1,0,I don't care what happens when you get angry.
4,1,0,We know you're shagedelic, but no one's impressed.
5,0,0,I don't see the humor at all, Matt.
5,0,0,Yes, I see, but we only offer haute yoga.
4,1,0,I understand what they use in India, but the status symbols we use are foam pads and spandex.
5,0,0,I got kicked off Tinder.
4,1,0,Size matters. But for this, smaller is better.
5,0,0,No, "Downward Mat" is done like this.
5,0,0,You're not fooling anyone! A bigger mat won't hide your small hands.
5,0,0,We aren't really interested in THAT kind of Eastern inner-decor.
4,0,1,I know you said yoga mat, but this is all my mom had!
5,0,0,We're all so impressed to hear your yoga skills are "yuge."
5,0,0,Man, it's not always about size.
3,0,1,I think you are in the wrong class, this is Yoga not magic carpet rides!
4,1,0,Believe me, Aladdin, there is no magic carpet ride to nirvana.
5,0,0,You must be looking for Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoga down the street.
4,2,0,Oh, I'm just here for the cucumber water.
5,0,0,what? but i'm Arnold jr. !
5,0,0,Sorry, Aladdin...that carpet won't fly over my downward dog.
5,0,0,I said to bring a yoga mat, not a magic carpet.
4,1,0,Nice yoga hat.
5,0,0,I understand that you want to use your magic carpet and not the yoga mat, Bob. Unfortunately, it infringes upon the other students' space.
4,1,0,You know, size doesn't matter?
5,0,0,Downward facing dog? A male at my age needs a magic carpet.
5,0,0,If you want to cut some, ask the dance studio downstairs.
5,0,0,As long as it is skidless.
4,1,0,Yoga was cutting into my antiquing time; so I'm multitasking.
4,0,0,You're sure this one can elevate me to a higher power?
5,0,0,Size does matter here.
5,0,0,You're too late. Magic carpet rides were all the rage in the late 60's.
4,0,0,Not everything needs to have been made in India, sir.
5,1,0,I guess in some cases we do judge here.
5,0,0,Be careful not to let the moths out!
3,1,0,Sir, I would like to share with you that Bow Down Yoga is a place where patrons subscribe to minimalism.
5,0,0,In this case, bigger is not better.
2,1,0,I was looking for a magic yoga ride.
3,1,1,OK, it stays. But the recliner and the flat-screen have to go.
5,0,0,Once you liberate yourself from that carpet, maybe you will start to live.
4,1,0,I’m sorry. ‘Dead’ is the one body type not welcome here.
4,0,1,I think we need to go over the ground rules.
5,0,0,I guess I misunderstood when you claimed to know 'down dog.'
5,0,0,When choosing your first Yoga mat, one must consider the following... portability vs comfort and stability, you've obviously opted for comfort and stability." "What's that you say? You're hear to go deliver a rug?
4,1,0,"His Dudeness", Tia chi is next door.
5,0,0,Do you really think a cup was necessary?
5,0,0,This is a bend and kneel yoga class not carpet replacement.
4,1,0,You've never been to a yoga class before, have you?
5,0,0,This is Bow Down YogaIf you're looking for Magic Carpet Yoga, it's located on the roof.
5,0,0,I'm looking for an authentic spiritual experience.
4,0,0,Is that Vegan Outfitters' new animal-free hay and hemp mat?
5,0,0,When I said you need to be more flexible, I meant more than your hamstrings.
5,0,0,Leave your sarcasm at the door.
3,2,0,Republican yoga is next door.
4,1,0,You'll have to leave class, you're just not conforming sufficiently.
5,0,0,You won't be Aladin.
4,1,0,Mrs. Vanderbilt will not be here today.
5,0,0,Hi there, I have a yoga mat delivery for a Mr. Al Ladin
6,0,0,In order to connect body and mind and to escape from this hectic, materialistic world, you’ll have to replace the clothes and mat with branded yoga gear and sign up at least 20 minutes in advance using your phone or risk losing your spot.
3,2,0,Namaste. Now beat it.
5,0,0,Sir, There is no such thing as X-Factor Yoga.
3,1,1,It's not a competition.
4,0,0,it's all uphill from here.
5,0,0,Go back home George! I told you, I need my space.
4,0,1,It's not _that_ kind of Oriental.
5,0,0,Can't you take off your shoes??!
3,2,0,I don't care if your name is Aladdin, no magic carpets, only yoga mats.
3,0,0,The size-matters meme notwithstanding...that's too big!
5,0,0,I am so sorry we cannot let your downward facing dog into the studio.
3,2,0,Sorry, no nap rugs.
4,1,0,Thanks, but yoga is really more of a solitary sport.
5,0,0,The rest of the team will be joining us.
4,1,0,Sir, you can not use a carpet for the flying crow pose.
4,1,0,Sorry sir. I'm afraid that rug will tie the room together. We're here to release tension.
5,0,0,UMMMMM.
3,1,0,My boss said you can use the rug if you promise to keep your clothes on this time.
4,0,0,You're gonna need a smaller mat.
5,0,0,I'll have to ask you to leave; Bow Down Yoga is a secular all-inclusive environment.
5,0,0,Let me guess. Home Depot?
5,0,0,You can use it but we're not announcing your entrance.
4,1,0,Sorry, we don't teach the "Magic Carpet Ride" method.
4,0,0,It was not appropriate last week when you offered any female in the room to "take a ride on your magic carpet"
5,0,0,I think that you're looking for Yogi Berra.
4,0,0,Honestly, Jim, do you have to try to outdo me in everything?
4,0,1,Yoga for idiots is in the next studio.
4,1,0,I said a big HUG.
5,0,0,While we do encourage class unity, it is expected that everyone who does roll their own not infringe upon other people's space, in your case the Bob Marley class starts next hour.
5,0,0,Please tell me you're a burglar and not a new student.
4,1,0,We tend to be minimalists.
4,0,0,Every individual has their own preference according to what they may feel comfortable with.
4,1,0,I have a wide stance.
3,2,0,NOmaste.
4,1,0,You can start by taking off that hat.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, it's not the carpet, it's what could be inside.
4,1,0,No Aladdin - I don't believe it'll show me a whole new world.
1,2,0,Does your mother know you took it?
5,0,0,"You must be looking for the "Trump School of Yoga"!
6,0,0,No rug. No shoes. No you.
5,0,0,Yes, I spoke last week about inhabiting your personal space, but I'm afraid that's more space than I had in mind.
4,1,0,Looks like you're here to nama-stay.
4,0,0,"Bow Down" does not mean that you need a large prayer mat.
6,0,0,' Sorry, but no yoga Matthews allowed"
5,0,0,What, are you a crazed libertarian from Hicksville or something? This is YOGA, and you must conform! Style, always style!
4,0,1,Eminent domain doesn't apply here, Mr. Trump.
4,1,0,I see…you’re the one from out of town I sold the yoga mat to on Craigslist
3,0,1,Using a carpet as a mat is somehow endearing
2,2,0,I"m sorry, we don't have a passive-aggressive yoga class.
4,1,0,This takes "manspreading" to a whole new level.
5,0,0,But can you welcome the rug burns?
5,0,0,I'm big into prayer
3,2,0,My personal space is rather large.
4,2,0,Sorry, Persian yoga is next door.

4,1,0,Body slams will cost extra!
4,1,0,This is a minimalist yoga class. The maximalists meet for five hours on Wednesday nights.
5,0,0,No, that's not the stumpasana prop.
5,0,0,You're paying for everyone's chakras realignment surgery!
4,1,0,How did you get through the Idiot Detector?
5,0,0,Y'know, a racist Oriental carpet isn't going to make this any easier.
5,0,0,We meant a yoga mat!!
5,0,0,Yes, we also want you to feel comfortable, Mr. Coolidge; but you're stretching it a bit too far.
5,0,0,Rugs are fine, but no hats.
5,0,0,A Presidents' Day sale is not an excuse for tardiness!
3,2,0,No, I'm pretty sure the degree of spiritual enlightenment you receive is NOT directly proportional to the size of your yoga mat.
4,0,0,You have to put it in the dryer.
5,0,0,Yoga Cartwheels is in the Annex.
5,0,0,where are the forty thieves?

4,1,0,Come back when you have a higher level of consciousness.
4,0,0,The beginning Persian class doesn't start until 10.
3,2,0,No Bill, we're appropriating Buddhist culture this week -- not Moroccan!
5,0,0,So, appears you can't spell Bedouin.
5,0,0,Carpet bombing?
3,2,0,You and the rug can stay but the socks have to leave.
5,0,0,The sneakers are fine, the socks are fine, the shorts are fine, the long sleeves are fine, the big rug is fine, but the Trump hat has to go.
3,2,0,You must be the ‘non-Prius guy’.
3,1,1,I'm sorry, you haven't got a prayer here.
2,3,0,I'm not sure that enlightenment will do you any favors.

3,2,0,Air Aladdin is next door.
5,0,0,Even if you have expanded your consciousness, you do not need such a large yoga mat that looks more like a rug.
5,0,0,That will not tie this room together dude.
5,0,0,With all due respect for your religious freedom, prayer rugs don't meet our yoga mat policy!
2,2,0,Sorry, but to free your spirit from the illusory confines of the material world, you'll need our hundred-dollar yoga mat.
5,0,0,No, Imma Stay is not our greeting.
4,0,0,The victim's blood evidently was not "O" Positive, so we can't accept the donation!
4,1,0,I'm sorry but yoga is not a spectator sport.
4,0,1,A baseball cap? Really?!!!
5,0,0,... and secondly it's namaste, not "what the hey".
5,0,0,It's Bikram with a mat, not Berber with a rug
4,1,0,Loose the hat, Frank.

5,0,0,The shag lessons are next door.
5,0,0,I understand you're a "Big Dog" but this is Bow Down Yoga not Bow Wow Yoga.

4,1,0,This is not cultural appropriation this is an identification crisis.
5,0,0,I'm telling you again, there is no Julius Ceasar here.
5,0,0,Sorry, we have a dress and mat code here.

5,0,0,We don't do that kind of stretching.
4,1,0,You studied at Trump University?

5,0,0,Polow Yoga is next door.
4,1,0,You're not being very flexible about my yoga mat.
4,0,1,I've told you before; size doesn't matter here.
5,0,0,You're late.
3,1,0,Welcome to our diversity outreach program.
4,1,0,This is one place where size DOESN'T matter!
2,1,0,As long as you pay double

5,0,0,Chipotle delivers?

4,1,0,Fred, it's actually the socks.
5,0,0,#matenvy
5,0,0,More male ego - " Your mat is bigger than my mat." Not appropriate!
4,0,1,I like to feel the burn when I exercise...the rug burn that is.
2,3,0,We tend to favor minimalism.
5,1,0,I specifically asked for a mat that will not kill'em, not a guy named Matt with a knotted Kelim.
5,0,0,This class is 'waiting room only.' Just like your rug.
1,3,0,Yes, prayer rugs are allowed.
4,1,0,New students must sign a carpet burn release form.
4,1,0,That's not what I meant by size matters.
4,1,0,That looks like a downward dog pee stain.
4,1,0,No, I would not like to share a mat with you.
4,1,0,No, I don't know what they say about a guy with a big rug.
4,1,0,You've mistaken us for Textured Plush Yoga down in SoHo.
4,1,0,Can we trade?
5,1,0,I thought you were called Big Matt for a different reason.
3,1,1,I don't care if it muffles your farts...
4,1,0,The failure of DIY Yoga.
4,1,0,I don't care if your mat is 'really old skool'...not in my studio.

4,1,0,Sorry, but the "Angry White" yoga class has been cancelled until after the Republican debates.
4,0,1,Many people start out rugged
4,1,0,The advanced classes are on Wednesday.
4,1,0,I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I don't think this relationship is going to work.

5,0,0,A flying carpet? Good take on levitation!
3,0,2,Just find a spot,Aladdin.
5,0,0,It's not funny anymore! She's a collector on the 5th floor!
5,0,0,So welcome to your first hot yoga class, Bill. Looks like you are a sweater.
4,1,0,I'm taking my wife home.
4,1,0,Don't even try to say "Nemaste".
5,0,0,That will be perfect for when we get to the downward dining-table position.
4,1,0,Yes, we can help with lack of humility issues.
6,0,0,So, are we ever gonna meet this friend of yours, Cleopatra?
5,0,0,Big feet, big hands, really big mat. Yeah, I get it.
5,0,0,When I said "bring your rug," I meant the one on your head."
4,1,0,The telekinesis class isn't till 3:30.
4,0,1,I find using a rug really helps me from slipping in downward dog
5,0,0,It's yoga and not yogart and no you can't sit and gawk for a while.
3,2,0,When I said you should try getting out more I didn't really mean it.
4,1,0,This is just like when you brought that pool cue to the batting cages.
4,1,0,You're stressing me out.
5,0,0,I'm afraid we can't do anything about your girlfriend's body now.
3,2,0,Yoga for Dummies class is next door.
4,1,0,It's not the rug, it's the lack of smug.

5,0,0,Just think of it like I have a seasons ticket to this spot.
4,1,0,Mosque delivery is next door.
5,0,0,You were warned about drinking from that bottle without a guide.
4,0,0,Magic carpet rides are being held on the roof. This floor is reserved for relaxation yoga.
4,1,0,Sorry we've cancelled the flying carpet classes after a small accident with the ceiling fan.
4,1,0,I understand it is self-funded, but Mr. Trump will have to use the same mat as the rest of us.
4,0,1,No snoring this time.
3,2,0,The advanced relaxation class is next door.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, but, this is not about your comfort!
5,0,0,It's not the size, it's what you do on it.
5,0,0,Flying carpet class? One flight up.
5,0,0,No, you can't leave a body here.
4,1,0,You'll have to wait... They're not converting this building into condos until this afternoon.
5,0,0,So you're The Carpetbagger Yogi?
5,0,0,I have a rug, can I join women's yoga now?
5,0,0,Sir, unless you intend to use that magic carpet for a party of six or more, please park it at the door.
3,0,1,You're Yoga Matt?!
4,0,1,I understand the fibers are organic, Sir. But can you confirm those crumbs are gluten-free?
5,0,0,Is that my new Persian yoga mat?
5,0,0,Next time, I want more lotus pose and less genie lamp.
3,1,1,Exactly how much yoga are you planning on doing today?
5,0,0,Let me guess your occupation.
2,3,0,Someone's compensating for a weak chakra.
5,0,0,They said to bring my own mat and I like my space.
4,1,0,Welcome, Aladdin. So this is your first yoga class, huh?
4,0,0,Uncle Guido says grandma's a little stiff.
6,0,0,Umm, are you here for the course on "sacred masculinity" ? I'm afraid you're a bit early !
5,0,0,I said to bring a "mat,"not a "rug."
3,1,0,Yoga is possible for anybody who really wants it, and looks like you really want it.
5,0,0,Jules, did you see a sign on the door that read 'Dead Nigger Storage'?
5,0,0,Yogi not included.
4,1,0,I'll allow you to use it. But it's not a short cut to mindful levitation.
5,0,0,Separately
4,1,0,Unless you have a small woman in there, you've come to the wrong place.
5,0,0,Numiskul.
3,1,1,Next time, can you please not yell out "woof woof" when we do Downward Dog?
5,0,0,Please tell your Mother this isn't day care, and I know a dining room rug when I see one!
5,0,0,Delivery yoga is in the afternoon.
5,0,0,...also a three letter word, yes.
5,0,0,But I'm Persian!
5,0,0,No Turkish rugs or towels allowed.
2,2,1,Overcompensating just a bit?
3,1,0,Sorry, the class for overcompensaters is on Tuesdays.
5,0,0,No, we don't offer a group rate.
4,1,0,You'll have to smoke that outside.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, but our "Mastering the Flying Carpet Course for Beginners" is on Tuesdays.
5,0,0,Come on, it's not only functional, it really ties the room together too!
3,1,0,Actually we don't have 'Casual Friday' at Bow Down Yoga.
2,2,1,First visit?
4,1,0,Cleopatra' Yoga is down the street
5,0,0,My guess is that you are absurdly over-compensating
6,0,0,No, no - I said check out the Magic Carpet Yoga Mat at Anthro. Completely different.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but Yoga is NOT a Persian tradition.
2,1,2,I know it's you first yoga experience but you don't need a training mat.
4,0,0,All are welcome here. You'll have to tell Mr. Trump, no shoes, no platform no exceptions Namaste'.
2,2,1,That's just so people won't know you weren't on your way to yoga?
5,0,0,I don't care if it's a magic carpet, you can't use it in class.
5,0,0,Coach I know it's a close team, but they all need their own mats.
4,0,0,In yoga, bigger is not always better.
5,0,0,No, this is not a 'friends and family' class!
5,0,0,Do you want to meet me at the juice bar after class?
4,1,0,I think you want the carpet cleaning place next door.
5,0,0,"If that's the living room rug then you are about to do a very realistic Corpse Pose".
5,0,0,Don't you think it is overstretching it to say you are channeling your inner, interior decorator?
2,1,1,Got anything bigger?
5,0,0,Dig deep as you contemplate the difference between a rug and a mat.
5,0,0,the lay-out-the -rug- and - plotz classs starts next tuesday
5,0,0,bad downward dog
5,0,0,I understand your name is Matt but that doesn't entitle you to use a rug.
5,0,0,Roger, yoga is about so much more than who has the bigger rug.
3,2,0,Sorry, we don't allow manspreading.
4,0,0,So, they call you Mr Big, do they?
4,1,0,The baseball cross-training class starts next week.
5,0,0,And when will Mr. Trump be arriving?
5,0,0,The Dude wants his rug back.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, "eastward-facing dog?"
5,0,0,Uh your mat is quite big," "I thought size doesn't matter.
4,0,1,With all due respect, we request that you not be visible from our window.
4,1,0,Smaller, thicker and less decorative next time, please.
4,0,1,Trust me, you're not that flexible.
5,0,0,I've told you before. Downward elephant is the 2pm class.
4,1,0,Look, you and I both know that doesn't fly in here.
5,0,0,YOU WANT THE UPPER CRUST OF YOGA,THERE'RE IN THE PENTHOUSE.
5,0,0,magic carpet or not, its too big for this class
1,3,1,Our position on this is inflexible.
5,0,0,No rule says you can't wear kneepads instead.
4,1,0,With men it's always about size, isn't it?
4,0,0,Believe me, Bob, nobody will be bending down into your personal space.
5,0,0,Assume the shag position.
5,0,0,I'm sorry. "Bow Down" does not condone rugged individualism.
5,0,0,Harold, I don't think this relationship is going to work.
5,0,0,I'm sorry but I'm going to have to ask you to leave. It's not the Oriental, it's the normcore.
5,0,0,Only if it is a Lululemon carpet.
4,1,0,Mecca is out the window to the Southeast.
3,1,1,No, we are not Ground School for carpet flyers!
5,0,0,No, our allotment of floor space is not based on the gender pay gap.
5,0,0,The auditions for Anthony and Cleopatra are next door.
5,0,0,I said bring your mat, Mr. Trump, not your rug.
5,0,0,When I said doggy down to you, I was -not- referring to a yoga position. Get lost!
5,0,0,I don't think you get the concept
5,0,0,Persian rugs seems to have been quite qui successful with their new campaign strategy.
5,0,0,Is it organic astroturf?
5,0,0,Really? Not even you are that dumb
3,1,1,Drop and roll before I bonk you on the head!
5,0,0,I don't care if your name IS Aladin. You lie it! Don't fly it.
5,0,0,I agree.....Bikram may work with a flying carpet.......but we're too close to LaGuardia.
5,0,0,I saw you driving in. That's a very nice Porsche convertible.
5,0,0,Look what the shaggy dog dragged in.
4,1,0,We said you can practice at home, not like you’re home.
4,2,0,At least your clothing is appropriate this time, Aladdin.
4,1,0,Yo Yoga? That's across the street.
4,0,0,You just don't have that special Bow Down Yoga attitude.
5,0,0,I think you'll need your carpet at the boxing ring next door.
4,0,0,Could you please center it? And yourself?
2,1,2,We don’t shag here.
5,0,0,Is there a lamp in there too?
5,0,0,I'm afraid you exceed our minimalism, attitude and materialism guidelines. Good day Mr. Smith.
5,0,0,We just don't have anything in common Kyle.
5,0,0,No 'flying carpet' is needed for Yogic flying.
5,0,0,I'm kinda old school...
4,1,0,It's a movement practice, not a move-in practice.
4,1,0,We don't condone manspreading in our studio.
5,0,0,This is New York, people don't LIVE in that big of an area.
5,0,0,Honey, this "Make America Great Again!" thing has gone far enough.
3,2,0,Carpet Diem is two doors down.
5,0,0,The spread eagle is not a yoga pose.
4,1,0,It's not practical, but I admire your sense of aesthetic.
5,0,0,I'm so sorry, this image just isn't going to work for us.
5,0,0,Your name is Matt. You’re old school and prefer rugs. Do I have that right, Matt?
5,0,0,Neanderthal yoga is at 6.
5,0,0,The term "Double Wide" doesn't apply here.....at all.
3,0,2,Feel free to leave your yoga mat camouflage at the door.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but, in this class, size doesn't matter....
3,1,0,No, dad, this is definitely not a hot yoga class.
5,0,0,And the miller he has served him worse than that, for he's ground him between two stones.
3,1,0,The size of your mat does not matter.
3,2,0,You did not purchase a family membership
5,0,0,No, this is Bikrim. Blue Collar Yoga starts at 11.
5,0,0,I said Yoga met, not biggest mat.
3,2,0,I'm guessing it's your first time...
5,0,0,What happens in your man caves stays in your man cave.
4,1,0,Sir, there's a lulu lemon right next door.
5,0,0,Does this look like 'Yoga for Bros?'
5,0,1,You're not allowed to relax unless you have the right attire.
3,1,1,If you'd like to use your magic carpet as a yoga mat, you're going to have to sign a waiver in the event that it takes off during seated meditation.
4,1,0,That will have to be screened for bed bugs.
5,0,0,You're early for the magic carpet class.
4,1,1,Had enough, big shot?
4,0,1,Yoga is not a competition sport, Nigel.
3,1,1,We like our foods natural but our mats synthetic.
4,1,0,The flying yoga class meets on the roof.
4,1,0,That's really more of a carpet than a mat.
4,1,0,I'm boycotting Big Yoga
4,0,1,Please sir, we leave our shoes by the door
5,0,0,Sandra, I respect your opinion but this is my Yogi Bear mat. If we just take a deep breath...and relax...I'm sure we can make this work.
5,0,0,This is how I roll!
4,1,0,You're entirely welcome here, but the corpse has to be outside.
5,0,0,Sorry, "Make Yoga Great Again" is in the next studio.
2,3,0,Let me guess: you're new to yoga.
6,0,0,'It Ain't Yogi 'Till It's Yoga is across the street.'
5,0,0,Sorry, but it doesn't match the drapes.
5,0,0,Well, well...what have we here? Another vain attempt at compensation?
5,0,0,You may use your 'magic flying carpet' today. But please get a yoga mat for next time.
5,0,0,Bigger is not always better!
3,2,0,Around here, size doesn't matter.
5,0,0,What do you think this is--a slumber party?
4,0,0,So, by the size of that oversized rug....I have to assume you are voting for Trump?
5,0,0,So your name's Aladdin. You still can't bring that rug in here.
5,0,0,No, you can't bring your recliner.
3,2,0,I'm sorry sir, we do not permit man-spreading at this facility.
4,0,0,Persian yoga doesn't start until 2:00.
5,0,0,Oh, just keep it. My Ex, Aladdin, left it.
4,1,0,I can't wait to see how you interpret downward dog.
5,0,0,A larger mat will not help you master yoga any faster.
4,0,0,He said. Take any rug in the house
5,1,0,Your family will participate?
5,0,0,Your hand size has nothing to do with your mat size.
5,0,0,Jam Band yoga class is next door.
5,0,0,That's a great idea! I sweat a lot too.
5,0,0,Maybe after class, I can take you on a magic carpet ride?
4,1,0,Yoga is about letting your mind go. I think you're half way there.
5,0,0,A sore thumb won't be a problem.
4,0,1,So let me guess, you're here to 'Make Yoga Great Again'?
5,0,0,The size of your mat really doesn't matter
5,0,0,Try to think of yoga as everything that you are not.
5,0,0,Let me suggest knee pads instead of you, ah, rug.
5,0,0,Mixed doubles? Good luck with that.
5,0,0,How's the new pickup treatin ya?
5,0,0,I'm sorry, but we don't serve your kind here.
4,1,0,The flying carpet class is down the hall to the right.
3,3,0,Sorry, I don't think you just flew in from Persia.
4,0,1,What exactly do you expect to shag?
3,0,1,We're flexible about everything except mat size.
6,0,0,It's a fair trade rug from an Ashram in India.
5,0,0,My name is Matt and I am here with mat.
5,0,0,But, it flies when I sit in a Lotus position!
5,0,0,What? I don't understand the problem, all you said was bring a mat
5,0,0,Perhaps we need to make that "no solicitation" sign easier to see...
3,2,0,I think what you're talking about is transcendental compensation.
4,0,0,Sorry, there is no tailgating in yoga.
3,0,2,The Spirit within me is asking you to just leave.
5,0,0,"No...That does not make you yoga master..." Submitted by Rebbecca Parker Charlevoix MI
3,1,0,And I suppose your Armani is at the dry cleaner's.
5,0,0,Carpetbagger.
3,1,1,When I say, "that's a stretch," I don't mean yoga.
1,2,0,Man cave yoga is in the back.
5,0,0,No, you can't lie down here to take a nap with all these freaks.
4,1,0,We don't like man spread in any derivative
4,1,0,This is not a flying carpet class.
4,1,0,Yo Ga. Not Yo Gi.
5,0,0,You want 'satya'?...You really want 'satya'?... Well, my friend, in all honesty, you can't handle 'satya'!!!
5,0,0,It's how you use it.
5,1,0,You still have to take this class smartypants and I know your baseball bat is inside the carpet.
2,0,3,You must be the guy from Om Depot.
2,0,2,What do you mean, 'Make Yoga Great Again'?
4,0,1,In this studio size doesn't matter
4,1,0,What is it you don't understand about mat?
3,1,0,No, "man-spreading" classes are down the street.
4,0,0,I'll really miss having you in class Steve. You're idea of starting a Downward Facing Dog Club was simply brilliant.
5,0,0,Rule 1: There’s no “Yo!” in yoga. Rule 2: No man-spreading.
5,0,0,Yes, that's a classy, elegant, and luxurious mat, Mr. Trump, but it still won't fit.
4,1,0,You really didn't need to bring a "man sized" mat, Bob.
3,1,1,After years of being told he was inflexible, Jim finally took matters into his own hands.
2,2,0,You can't be serious...TUBE SOCKS?
2,2,1,Perhaps you could come back when I'm not here.
3,0,0,$80 is a very competitive price for our mats.
3,1,1,Okay, forget everything I said about getting in touch with your inner self.
5,0,0,OHHHHHMmmmm, nope!
3,2,0,Is it safe to assume that you are here for the beginner's class?
4,0,0,Seriously? A magic carpet?
4,1,0,Now, concerning your spittoon...
4,0,1,Clear your mind, not your living room.
5,0,0,I distinctly said I wanted it "cleansed."
5,0,0,Sorry, Extreme Yoga is on Tuesdays
5,0,0,Yo ga to be kidding me!
5,0,0,I'm sorry but you'll have to leave,we don't do shag
4,1,0,Magic carpet ride lessons are two doors down.
3,2,0,Sorry, but size isn't such a big deal around here.
4,1,0,We have a strict policy against man-spreading.
4,1,0,You don't scare me!
5,0,0,No, sweat does not help release stains.
5,0,0,You heard "bad Dog" I said "Down Dog"
5,0,0,The brochure clearly says, yoga mat, bring a yoga MAT!
5,1,0,I'm going to put a leash on your Down Dog if you keep marking your territory this way.
5,0,0,You New Yorkers just love walking all over people.
2,0,2,Sir, please put that back in the lobby and use this one.
5,0,0,We don't teach levitation
5,0,0,Sorry, we do not allow those colors.
6,0,0,Yahtzee!
5,0,0,That's not how we roll.
5,0,0,Donald, we know you have small hands, but you have nothing to prove.
5,0,0,Excuse me, deliveries are through the rear entrance only.
5,0,0,I can't let a non-conformist take my spot I've had for years. I'm an incumbent.
2,3,0,Let me guess, your first time here?
5,0,0,I'm sorry but we can't Super-Size yoga
4,1,0,The first thing you have to learn is that less is more.
5,0,0,Personal space issues?
5,0,0,Yes, I suppose that is a less bourgeois way to "feel the Bern."
5,0,0,Take your fat ass to a barn, somewhere!
5,0,0,I am going to have to call you on the carpet before you set foot on it.
3,1,0,No, nobody will laugh at you if you wear yoga pants. It's the hat and that ridiculous rug that cracks us up.
4,1,0,No, a hairier mat does not make you more masculine.
5,0,0,Before we start you're going to have to cut a rug.
6,0,0,In yoga, less is more and more is less.
2,3,0,Sorry sir, but we only allow 18 square feet of Karma per person.
4,0,1,Yes,your party of five is ready.
4,1,0,This is yoga, not hooka.
4,1,0,We're not THAT flexible.
2,2,1,Yeah, I'm sure it's fine. They let me use this papyrus scroll.
4,0,0,We're sorry, but the downward facing dog is not allowed on that rug.
3,2,0,We're full today, our next class is never.
5,0,0,There's no spring training yogaclass.
3,1,1,Sorry, manspreading isn't allowed here.
4,1,0,I have a feeling that your mother's dining room is now short one yoga mat.
5,0,0,Sorry, but Governor Christie is not in this class.
4,1,0,You're here to ogle women, aren't you?
5,0,0,Size matters less than motion.
5,0,0,You by any chance Norbert? Your grandmother just aller, and she sounded upset.
4,1,0,Cleopatra doesn't need to always come wrapped in her carpet.
3,1,1,No, you cannot smoke that in here!
4,0,1,The magic carpet classes are upstairs.
4,1,0,No, just the mind and senses. I'm afraid the flying carpet is not going to work.
4,1,0,No, I don't think a larger mat will elicit the desired assumption about your anatomy.
5,0,0,Did I forget something?
5,0,0,Tell your Mom we don't do used carpet trade-ins.
3,1,0,I don't care if you brought it, or it brought you.
2,2,0,Thank you for leaving your couch and TV home this time.
5,0,0,New to the City?
4,1,0,We're going to pass. Studies have shown artificial turf to be damaging to joints.
5,0,0,We don't allow "rug envy" in our studio.
4,1,0,"I heard that the big one might be coming but I was thinking earthquake or asteroid.
3,2,0,I don't care if you bought your yoga mat in India; you can't use it here.
5,0,0,Seriously?! You brought a Persian rug to a Bikram yoga class?
3,0,1,Actually, the bro-ga studio is next door.
5,0,0,That rug culturally appropriates Asian culture and it doesn’t belong here. Namaste.
4,1,0,I see you brought a man-size mat this time, Andy.
5,0,0,Try Lululemon next time.
4,1,0,Is there a place for one more?
5,0,0,You need to be spiritual and grounded while still acting all superior.
6,0,0,When my wife drags me to yoga.
5,0,0,We buy cheap used carpeting. We sell expensive antique yoga mats.
4,1,0,Did your wife make you come ?
5,0,0,The instructions said: "....bring a YOGA mat, not a GOYA mate....".
5,0,0,Now I'm gonna show those amateurs some REAL yoga
5,0,0,My smugness comes from, unlike yours, knowing my mat doesn't come from a sweatshop!
4,1,0,We said to bring a mat not a flying carpet.
4,0,0,You can move in her "mat," but SHE has to do the yoga.
5,0,0,That's not a vintage yoga mat. It's carpet.
5,0,0,No, I've never heard of the grand master Yogi Berra.
5,0,0,I don't care if your mat is 100 percent Kashmir, we insist on polystyrene here!
5,0,0,We don't do group therapy.
5,0,0,When I said let's sweep our affair under the rug....
4,1,0,your fear of Spandex, Sir, is certainly understood and MUCH appreciated... however, rules are rules...
2,1,2,Size doesn't matter here, either.
4,2,0,My wife sent me here to relax. Where does the tv go?
5,0,0,You're looking for "Bob Up Yogi." It's two doors down.
5,0,0,This isn't little-league.
5,0,0,I can't believe you brought the Persian into my sacred space
3,1,0,The rug is ok - but next time try not to bring the sofa and the tv.
5,0,0,You must be interested in our group rates.
5,0,0,If you want to free your mind you have to do exactly what I say.
5,0,0,By any chance is your name Cleopatra?
4,1,0,My problem? Let's start with your hat.
5,0,0,"Your wife called. She fell and broke her hip climbing out of the shower".
5,0,0,Even if the sign did say 'Bedouin Yoga' we wouldn't let your camel take the class.
5,0,0,Your definition of mat needs an update.
5,0,0,How many times do I have to tell you Joe? Size really doesn't matter.
4,1,0,No. You cannot do yoga here and face Mecca.
4,1,0,What time can we expect Mr. Trump?
5,0,0,First time? I can always spot the unbalanced.
3,1,1,And lose the baseball cap too.
3,1,1,Where did you get your mat? Costco?
4,0,0,You have the wrong floor. The itchy skin yoga class is on the next level.
5,0,0,If your yoga farts require such heavy dampening then we'd like you to work out at another studio.
5,0,0,Sorry, we don't teach flying carpet.
5,0,0,strip, lay and watch
3,3,0,Already I'm thinking this class might not be right for you.
5,1,0,Need the extra padding,do we,softie.
5,0,0,Jasmine doesn’t teach today and she doesn’t want to see you anymore now that you’ve let yourself go
4,0,0,The Carpet Yoga class is down the hall.
5,0,0,Perhaps you could "just run a few laps" around the interior of your skull?
4,1,0,How do you expect to gentrify this neighborhood with that?
4,1,0,I'm going to have to accuse you of manspreading
3,1,1,Our family-style seating is in the rear of the studio.
5,0,0,Sorry - If it doesn't hurt, then it's not yoga.
3,0,1,You'll have to take your manspreading elsewhere.
5,0,0,It's only a 30 minute session. There's no need to bring nesting material.
4,0,0,Bro Down Yoga is next door.
4,0,0,Let's try to keep that mantra below stadium-noise level today, Chad.
4,0,0,Wrong kind of Indian -- and stop calling me "Paleface."
4,1,0,Your yoga mat is bigger than the both of us.
5,0,0,It is called Downward Dog, not Downward Elephant
4,1,0,We don't smoke and we don't chew and we don't lay with the boys that do.
5,0,0,We don't do magic carpet yoga here.
4,0,0,A downward dog with a matt, not a dirt dog with a rug.
3,1,1,Yes, I do think a flying carpet for your mat would be a distraction for the class.
6,0,0,We run a reputable establishment. No carpetbaggers allowed here.
5,0,0,No, we never advertised 'Super Size Me.'
3,2,0,Your yoga mat really ties the room together.
2,2,0,The free range Dad Bod class is held outside.
5,0,0,Nama - go away.
5,0,0,Sorry, interlocking group yoga is not allowed.
3,2,0,That's a bit of a stretch.
3,1,0,That's for "Rugrats," the mother-child Pilates studio next door.
5,0,1,We don't do casual Fridays.
5,0,0,Sorry, flying carpets are not allowed.
4,1,0,Sir, I'm afraid this is a masculinity-free zone.
5,0,0,Np we don't offer Persian variations
4,0,0,The Flying Carpet lesson is next week.
5,0,0,No... I really am here for the yoga!
5,0,0,A magic carpet is okay but sweat is the conveyance here.
4,0,0,I didn't say we CAN never share a mat. I said we WILL never share one.
4,0,0,When you called earlier today I said foam, not faux
5,0,0,This is what I meant when I told you, "you will need to bring a soft pad for the class".
4,1,0,I asked for the persian design!
2,2,0,The new body you get is supposed to be your own.
4,1,0,Enlightenment happens AFTER conforming to social norms.
4,1,0,Sir, your rug is not the same as a yoga mat.
5,0,0,This wasn't the kind of burn I was expecting.
5,0,0,I don't care if Mr. Trump says you have to think huge to be huge--and no, yoga is not all about the square-footage!
4,0,0,That's very flattering, but I'm afraid I only date within my own species.
5,0,0,It's BOW down yoga, not HOE down yoga
3,0,1,My concerns have nothing to do with its being from Iran.
4,1,0,As long as it's made in China.
5,0,0,I'm gonna need more space.
3,1,1,We don't do man's spread here.
5,0,0,Nama-go, Yoga Berra!
4,1,0,As long as it doesn't start to fly during class...
5,0,0,You shouldn't compensate with your mat.
4,1,0,Bigger is not better around here, macho man.
5,0,0,An "oriental" rug? Sir, a yoga studio is no place for cultural appropriation.
5,0,0,I haven't gotten my paycheck, yet
5,0,0,Sure, you can use that. We are pretty flexible.
5,0,0,TRY BIG BOY RUG YOGA AROUND THE CORNER
5,0,0,Leave you mat and your ego at the door.
5,0,0,No, it's dog down yoga, not "doggie-style" yoga!
3,2,0,One does not win at yoga.
4,0,0,Welcome to my yoga studio, ma'am
4,1,0,No, having a bigger rug doesn't help, either.
5,0,0,Sir, I'm sad to see that the Occupy Yoga movement didn't fully take off, but you need to leave.
2,2,0,I'm sorry, but manspreading is not actually a form of yoga.
2,2,0,Just make sure your downward facing dog doesn't have an accident.
4,1,0,Are you more interested in a magic carpet ride?
2,3,0,I need it cleaned and back for my 2:40 to LA.
5,0,0,You say it's sweat absorbing and gluten free?
6,0,0,Your dust is clouding my chakra.
4,1,0,There's no need to compensate here.
4,0,1,Is that mat of yours big enough for two downward dogs or is that a magic carpet?
5,0,0,Yes Mr. Noffsinger, we received the call from your boss. I understand you are taking the company's softball league very seriously...
4,0,0,No, Arabian Knights yoga is upstairs.
2,2,0,We do Upward and Downward Facing Dog, but not Dog Did My Rug.
5,0,0,I'm very mindfully asking you to stick that where the sun salutations don't shine. Namaste.
3,2,0,Is it made of natural fiber?
6,0,0,Actually, I can shove my head there
3,2,0,No, a yoga mat and a Persian rug are not 'basically the same thing.'
5,0,0,We don't care how you do it in South Dakota.
5,0,0,Yes...it is possible, ancient Persia had some kind of Yoga. But...sir, that's not the point...
5,0,0,Take your rug and your New York Values outta here.
4,1,0,No, no discount for having been to the mountain.
4,0,1,Hot rug-burn yoga isn't until 3 o'clock.
4,1,0,That isn't minimalist enough...
4,2,0,This does NOT count as a romantic gesture.
5,0,0,OK, I get it it, you don't want to take couple's yoga.
5,0,0,Jesus, Derek, do you have to overcompensate for everything?
5,0,0,I'm sure your downward dog IS very furry.
5,0,0,Technically you'd be munching my 'mat'
5,0,0,Size does not matter
5,0,0,It's actually the attire that doesn't fit.
4,0,0,Too comfortable. Men's yoga is upstairs.
4,1,0,Your mat's too aggressive. This is a yoga class.
5,0,0,Does it fly?
4,1,0,No sir, carpet flying classes are next door.
3,2,0,This is your first time, isn't it?
5,0,0,You must be the Bro-ga instructor.
3,1,1,Afraid of a little spandex there fella?
5,0,0,You are not in the wilderness, you are not earning your Eagle Badge, and that's not a Yoga mat !
5,0,0,Nooooo. The Magic Carpet Riding Class is on Thursdays.
5,0,0,No- we don't offer Persian yoga here
4,1,0,I'm sorry but I believe your looking for the Trump class this is the Hilary class.
5,0,0,I'm sorry; your mat is large enough for two or more. Yoga mats must be individual size. It's the law.
4,0,1,This is Amazon's best selling mat?
5,0,0,Another victim of the corpse pose.
5,0,0,I think you've now reached the stage that some of the ancient masters called "jerkhood."
5,0,0,You seem to have yoga mat envy
4,0,0,You don't say! The rug is Persian too!
5,0,0,This is the wrong place for a 3 for the price of 2 carpet room offer - Namaste
4,0,0,Yours is bigger than mine but you will still need to follow my poses.
4,1,0,Yes, I can see your mat is big enough for two, but no, I do not want to practice Kama Sutra positioning with you.
4,1,0,Yes the Instructor position is open, but I must say, you looked better on paper, Mr. Guru
5,0,0,Do the Lotus Pose on that mat and you’ll have a rash in places I’d rather not talk about.
3,0,1,Can you CUT a RUG?
4,0,0,This neighborhood just isn't what it used to be...
5,0,0,You're right- we don't need to do everything together.
5,0,0,You won't impress anyone with the size of your man rug.
5,0,0,The flyer said this was Persian yoga.
4,0,1,If that's not made of wheatgrass, get it out of here.
4,0,1,We do not have an area for fans!
5,0,0,We're done. You can set up for "Bro'ga" now.
4,1,0,Sir, when I asked if you were "getting anything out of this class", I didn't mean the area rug!
5,0,0,Non hotrgular guy with Napalese rug yoga is next door.
3,1,1,Alladin's class is next door.
5,0,0,Not surprisingly, you have established the limit of yoga's capacity to alter one's life force.
4,0,0,You just said bring a mat
5,0,0,Ultimate manspeading. Not very namaste.
5,0,0,Going to one yoga class is not going to cause you to suddenly sprout a third eye.
3,1,1,I'm pretty flexible, but this is pushing it.
4,1,0,Our beginner's class includes a session on "Yoga for the tragically un-hip"
5,0,0,Alternative group participation starts next week.
4,1,0,Bro Down Yoga is two blocks over.
5,0,0,It is better than last week's beach chair. Here, just use mine!
4,1,0,Have you considered private lessons?
5,0,0,I think you'll find this much different from home fitness videos.
4,1,0,More yoga, less mansplaying.
4,0,1,But that's our sex rug, honey. I said bring a yoga mat!
4,1,0,I said the "practice" was oriental.
5,0,0,We're feeling some conflict between our spartan mats and your Persian carpet.
4,1,0,The bro-ga studio is next door.
5,0,0,I'm sorry but your rug is too big!
1,2,2,We get it. You're straight.
5,0,0,You'll have to pay for 2 spots.
3,1,0,I thought I told you to leave your rug at home. It's ruining the finish.
5,0,0,I know you're a growing boy.
2,1,0,We find our current fad here quite satisfactory at the moment, thank you.
2,2,0,That looks big enough to hide our instructor's body.
4,1,0,Delivery for Mrs Trump!
4,1,0,This is Yoga class. The Mafia after school program is next door.
5,0,0,Okay, Donald, you win. Yours is bigger than mine.
4,1,0,I think you've misunderstood. We are not a vanity gym.
4,1,0,A magic carpet will not help your lotus pose.

4,1,0,Extreme Rug Beating is next door
4,0,1,I like that you stretch to the beat of a different tabla.
2,2,0,It's not me, it's you.
4,1,0,I am assuming that your new body is in there.
5,0,0,I ordered Pergo.
5,0,0,You will need two class passes to use that mat.
4,0,1,I don't care if you can do the Destroyer of the Universe pose, your mat's still too big.
6,0,0,No, we can't teach your magic carpet to fly.
5,0,0,The knot yoga class meets on Tuesday.
5,0,0,Listen , Trump Yoga is next door.
4,0,1,No, we're not interested in an upgrade. Namaste.
4,1,0,Ah--next door, Trump Tower.
3,2,0,Prayer Rug goes to the Mosque, next door.
4,1,0,You can join the class, but no bragging about the thread count.
5,0,0,I got my rug at Ikea where did you get yours?
2,2,1,"No.....one mat with 8 people does not get you a group discount".
5,0,0,A 'sweet deal' with Ernie's Carpet Blowout Barn is no fast track to enlightenment, bub.
3,1,1,First yoga date?
6,0,0,Since this is all hocuspocus anyway, I figured I'd just use my magic carpet here instead of a yoga mat.
4,1,0,Get serious, Ali Baba.
3,2,0,You know the rules. Only Lululemon brand accessories in this class.
5,0,0,Sorry, but our yoga class for furniture movers is next week.
4,0,1,You can use the rug but the lounge chair and umbrella have to go.
5,0,0,We have a dress code.
5,0,0,Namaste...that's actually Yiddish for "we appreciate your small, unobtrusive mat."
4,1,0,There is an extra charge for showing off!
5,0,0,Yes, the camel must pay full price. ....I've seen his knees.
5,0,0,Bow down to Mecca yoga meets at noon.
5,0,0,"Naw, must stay," Sandra insisted.

5,0,0,Is that a banana or are you just happy to see me?
3,1,1,Good flight?
4,0,1,Rug rats workout downstairs.
4,0,1,Governor Christie's Mat Must Face Trump Tower, Not NJ!
5,0,0,Does that come in antimicrobial?
5,0,0,In this feminist world, the rugged approach is obsolete.
5,0,0,Sorry Aladdin, the beginners class is tomorrow.
4,1,0,Actually, a simple foam pad is more appropriate than an 'Oriental rug'.
5,0,0,Sorry, the Intro for Midwesterners class starts at 10.
5,0,0,Compensating for something?
5,0,0,This isn't a sleepover!
4,1,1,Maybe you'd be happier at Cousin Eddie's Yoga Barn.
5,0,0,No, we used to be "Dress Down Yoga," but we changed management.
5,0,0,You said you were flexible...
4,1,0,and you can tell Mr Trump that he'll use the same mats as everyone else, even if they WERE made in China.
4,0,1,Sorry. The flying carpet yoga class doesn’t start until next week.
5,0,0,It won't make for an authentic experience.
5,0,0,No, I don't know which direction points to Mecca.
5,0,0,Omar's place is next door...
1,4,0,You're new here, aren't you?
4,0,0,And you weren't at all suspicious when you searched "Yogi" on eBay?
5,0,0,The best I can do is four chair poses, but no table.
4,1,0,You ordered a mat for yoga
5,0,0,Honey, I get it, you don't need to prove you're a real man! But that's not a real yoga mat.
4,0,1,Now THIS is a bit of a stretch.
4,0,1,Namaste yourself.
4,1,0,We no longer offer Muslim prayer aerobics.
4,1,0,Size doesn't matter, it's how you use it.

5,0,0,Your Magic Carpet cannot pause in my Studio!
5,0,0,tepraC cigaM yM
5,0,0,Is this the macho man yoga class?
4,1,0,That rug has to go - I can't be flexible.
4,0,0,I can guarantee that your frequency will rise, sir.
4,1,0,Sorry, the flying carpet classes are next door.
5,0,0,I don't care if it's a genuine Persian yoga mat, it doesn't meet health and safety standards and I could loose my licence!
5,0,0,What do you mean, where do you want it?
2,2,0,No, Yogi Berra Yoga is two doors down.
5,1,0,The carpet cleaners are around the corner.
4,1,0,I'm guessing you didn't get that from lululemon
4,1,0,I disagree. I don't think we need to add a class called "Bro-ga"
4,0,1,Let's make yoga great again.
6,0,0,Your reputation here’s gone downward, dawg.
5,0,0,Your rug is fine.. but the socks...........

4,0,1,We don't allow Trump mats in here.
5,0,0,We don't do ironic hipster yoga here at Bow Down, Jeremy, just regular yoga.
5,0,0,The drapes don't match EVERY carpet dorkwad.
4,0,0,This is Bow Down Yoga sir not Bow Down Yogi.
5,0,0,Send Henrietta back. She's beyond our help.
4,1,0,You're in the outward bow down class.
4,1,0,Still man-spreading, Robert?
5,0,0,Put Mr. Christie's mat on the far right.
5,0,0,...that it was the stage rug for the Grateful Dead's '78 World Tour doesn't matter. It's still too big to use in my studio.
4,1,0,When Sophie told me you had a Napoleon complex, she wasn’t joking.
2,3,0,You'll learn to surrender your "body, mind and heart". And with any luck, the outfit.
4,1,0,I told you to bring a mat, not your flying carpet.
5,0,0,Two sides of the same coin: To judge is to be judged
5,0,0,Yoga Matt is not a real superhero.
5,0,0,If you cut the rug, you can join our dance class
3,0,2,We strongely urge beginners to look the part.
5,0,0,I don't care even if it's a flying carpet, I'm not going out with you.
4,1,0,I don't care how rich you are, I still say you're just showing off.
3,1,0,I'm ready to relax now!
4,1,0,And how many years worth of exercise did we find under that?
4,1,0,I love that you're protesting the commercialization of yoga culture, Jeremy.
4,2,0,Why, of course we have a hip-hop, 'living large' version of Bikram-Hatha-Astanga yoga, sir.
5,0,0,My Mom says you'd like to chew on one of these.
5,0,0,Are you compensating for something?
2,3,0,You have the wrong address. Aladdin's flight school is next door.
4,0,1,'Yoga mat,' not 'Yurt carpet'!
4,1,0,Your "feng shui" is blocking my energy flow!
5,0,0,No, I do not know the direction of Mecca.
5,0,0,I like the mat, but your outfit sucks.
5,0,0,Please don't light that smudge stick in here.
4,1,0,We can't keep having this conversation. It is not the size of the mat--also that is not a mat.
3,1,0,What do you mean, Persian yoga?
5,0,0,You've got the focus OK now. But I'm afraid your surrendering pose is going to take a little more work.
5,0,0,We only use mats made from petroleum-chemicals, but in our defense, made in the U.S.A!
5,0,0,I like your pile!
3,1,1,Frankly Bob, you're not Bow Down material.
4,1,0,I said I'm attracted to fit Asians; not Oriental runners.
5,0,0,I think you're looking for yoga for yutzes.
5,0,0,Your mat looks a little too rugged.
4,1,0,It's down the street, look for people carrying suits.
5,0,0,Our overcompensation group meets down the hall.
4,0,1,Aladdin just left!!
2,3,0,I'm sorry, our Neanderthal-looking-for-a-date class meets on yesterdays.
4,1,0,Is it medicinal?
5,0,0,Your guy says the whole class can have 80% off yoga mats this week only.
5,0,0,Sorry, Mr. Perkins--but your small rug on top is even scarier than the big one for your bottom.
4,1,0,Sorry, today is Dog Facing East. Yesterday was Doofus Carrying Rug.
3,1,1,That goes by the door
4,0,0,Your small-man, big-mat compensation issues are starting to hurt my business.
5,0,0,Have you seen my sister Cleo?
5,0,0,We're not giving flying lessons.
5,1,0,I don't care if it's got Cleopatra in it, you have to use ours.
5,0,0,A genie better be in there and grant me 3 wishes if you plan on rolling that out in my class. Namaste.
3,1,0,I'm sorry, this is a no-fly zone.
5,0,0,You've been living in that "mine's bigger than your's" world much too long
4,0,0,I think you want the place up the street -- Downward Doggy Style.
5,0,0,Yes, we stretch here. The bullpen for pitching from the stretch is next door.
5,0,0,Do your choices affect others? Consider your actions.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, we don't offer a group rate.
5,0,0,It's 100% organic.
5,0,0,Please take your rug and beat it!
4,1,0,Sure you do - and I play Rugby.
4,1,0,Yeah, this did used to be a rug store.......
4,0,0,Salesman or no, yoga doesn't involve flying on a magic carpet.
4,1,0,I'm normally pretty flexible, but I just can't bend on this.
5,0,0,How many times do I have to tell you that size doesn't matter?
5,0,0,No animal byproduct mats are allowed here.
4,1,0,I do appreciate your trying but we are just not on the same page.
3,1,1,Sir, it's not just the rug that may not fit.
3,2,0,This is yoga class, not body disposal.
5,0,0,It helps absorb my sweat, but does very little for my excessive leering.
5,0,0,Yes, we can help you lose your roll.
4,1,0,You’ve either signed up for Hatha or the stick welding course next door.
5,0,0,Namaste can only happen in my natural element.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, Spousal Disposal Inc is two doors down.
3,2,0,Good effort, but I need you to return that to the lobby.
5,0,0,The only way a woman can get a man to bow down to her is if she's his Yoga instructor
5,0,0,Let me guess, you're here for broga? 2nd floor.
5,1,0,You're overcompensating for a weak second chakra.
5,0,0,Together would be nice, but I'm allergic to dust.
4,0,1,Something tells me you may be high maintenance.
5,0,0,Her Bow Down dog soiled the rug
3,1,1,I don't think that's what your wife had in mind when she asked you to bring her to yoga.
5,0,0,I said Corinthian and not Iambic column for the Balustrade!
5,0,0,Remember, no flying more than two feet above the floor.
4,0,0,At 'Bow Down Yoga', we find our inner bliss on yoga mats, not area rugs.
3,2,0,Persian yoga is at 9.
3,1,1,If that thing can fly, I suggest you use it.
4,1,0,Wrong space sir. Rehearsals for Anthony and Cleopatra are held in the upstairs studio.
5,0,0,No, we don't supply the chair and television.
5,0,0,Size doesn't matter to me.
4,1,0,I guess we need more targeted marketing.
5,0,0,"Magic Carpet Flying Lessons" are next door.
2,3,0,We don't allow performance enhancing rugs.
4,1,0,Attain a higher plane? Pretty sure that's not what they meant.
5,0,0,We only show you the pose, it's up to you to dispose of the corpse.
3,2,0,Let me guess, you aren't vegan either.
5,0,0,Sorry. The ad was supposed to say Flying Dog not Flying Carpet.
4,1,0,It's "namaste"not "no mats day"
5,0,0,please place your shoes and hat at the entrance
3,1,0,I will let it go this time, but if I so much as hear you humming that song from Aladdin, you're out of here!
2,1,1,You're absolutely certain this mat was grass-fed?
3,0,1,The Yogi School is on the second floor.
5,0,0,You know this isn't the "How to be Aladdin" class right?
5,0,0,That was an excellent 'Sup Dog.'
4,1,0,Sorry, Sir, the flight school is next door.
3,1,1,No, we can't accommodate man spreading
5,0,0,When we practice yoga, we unify our body, mind and spirit. We do not have to feel "snug as a bug in a rug".
5,0,0,We don't subscribe to manspread Yoga here.
5,0,0,I meant something like a large bath towel, not a carpet.
4,0,0,Sorry about your downward dog accident, but we don't do pet stains
4,0,1,I can't believe you showed up without your yoga pants again.
4,1,0,You do realise that downward dog is meant for humans, right?
3,1,1,You're either carrying around a dead body, or you're new to yoga.
5,0,0,Magic carpet lessons, start at noon
4,1,0,Downward-facing smile.
4,0,0,Where's Aladdin, and what have you done to that magic carpet?
3,1,1,Size matters.
2,1,1,I'm sorry. There is no major league in yoga.
4,1,0,Yes, you can your that mat but I will have to charge you double.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, no flying carpets allowed.
5,0,0,We don't do the same yoga. XOXO
5,0,0,Carpet diem?
5,0,0,Sorry, but I'm looking for something a little more manufactured.
4,0,0,Broga? Yes, we embrace that in the basement.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, but if we allow you , soon everyone will be in here magic carpets.
5,1,0,We have parking for flying carpets behind the building.
4,1,0,This is what happens when you tell your man to bring the 'thing' on the floor to couples yoga while he is watching the game.
5,0,0,No-más-stay.
3,1,0,No, the studio doesn't need "classin' up".
5,0,0,I ordered a zen rug, not a Persian rug.
5,0,0,You can leave the rug but the rest of you has to go.
4,1,0,Using a flying carpet to attain the Eagle pose is frowned upon!
5,0,0,Ali Akbar dropped this class yesterday.
5,0,0,Sorry, no family discounts.
5,0,0,It's about spiritual liberation not a magic carpet ride.
4,1,0,At least our orientalism isn't gauche.
2,0,1,We don't practice the couch potato position here.
3,2,0,My guess is that the 8:00 session probably has the best hooters.
3,0,2,Let her out, Fred.
3,1,0,Namaste! Wait until I say "Namaste," you oaf!
5,0,0,My Persian rug is in need of a stretch!
6,0,0,Let me guess - bean burritos for lunch?
5,0,0,Pole dancing is at 6:00 PM.
5,0,0,No, we don't offer a 7th inning stretch. Wrong sport dude. Namaste.
5,0,0,You'll do just fine -- I can see you've got the right stuff.
4,1,0,Got the kids in there, dear?
5,0,0,Is that Persian?
5,0,0,You must be looking for the yogurt place next door.
3,2,0,This is Power Yoga. Persian Yoga is next door.
5,0,0,A one-percenter Downward-facing Dog? Nowhere near me, dude.
2,2,1,Okay, you win. We can go back to doing less things together.
5,0,0,Magic, Smagic, it's not welcome here!
5,0,0,Honey, I said Vinyasa, not Persian...
4,1,0,is that a tarp, or are you just happy to see me?
5,0,0,Double-wide yoga anyone?
4,1,0,Shag costs double.
4,1,0,This is yoga, not carpet flying
3,0,1,I really need to change that 'Bring Your Own Mat' policy...
5,0,0,The man-cave workout offers free cable and complimentary bags of Doritos.
3,1,0,You sweat a lot?
5,0,0,Sit on it. Lie on it. Just don't try to smoke it.
5,0,0,Look, Aladdin, you're welcome to stay, but please no flying this time. It distracts the others.
4,1,0,Hats are not allowed.
5,0,0,The Suds and Rugs is down the street
5,0,0,This is the crossfit gym, right?
3,2,0,Loose the silly hat!
4,1,0,No flying though.
4,1,0,You must be the new guy.
5,0,0,I didn't know Goliath was into yoga.
4,0,1,How many times must I tell you, size does not matter....
5,0,0,ManFlow Yoga is on Tuesday nights.
5,0,0,If you're into yoga mat envy, you've come to the wrong place."
5,0,0,No, I am not able to make you genie appear during Shavasana.
4,0,1,Body's out back.
4,0,0,Billy I don't think this is what your mom meant when she said you needed to be more flexible.
5,0,0,No, Alladin, I do not wish to try a new position with you on your magic carpet!
5,0,0,OK, maybe you're just not cutout for yoga. But I tell ya what, how about I refer you to that CrossFit gym around the corner?
5,0,0,Your name is Matt not rug!
3,1,0,Okay, I’ll agree size does matter; but you still can’t use it!
4,1,0,You're such a Darwinian.
4,1,0,Last week you brought a hookah, so it's an improvement.
4,1,0,Sorry. We are only allowed to shag on hump day.
5,0,0,Relax. I'm a real estate guy. This is just what we do.
4,0,1,Well, it's clear we don't have to stretch your ego.
5,0,0,But I just had hemorrhoid surgery!
5,0,0,The workout isn't murderous!
4,1,0,It's supposed to be a mat not a flying carpet!
3,1,0,You might want to stick with baseball.
4,0,1,I don't care if that qualifies as a "mat" in your 5,000-square feet McMansion.
4,0,0,No, I said I wanted a Persian hug.
5,0,0,How much mat lies matter.
5,0,0,Tell Vinny once and for all; I pose, not dispose, bodies.
5,0,0,Woman: You're clearly here as a spectator. Wouldn't it be easier to just go home and use your parents' internet? Guy: Nah, Imma stay
5,0,0,Aren't you a bit rugged for our studio?
4,0,1,I'm sure it does really tie the room together, Dude, but not this room.
3,1,0,I must insist. No FLYING CARPETS !
4,0,1,Trump yoga's on the 5th floor.
5,0,0,No, I am not interested in getting a rug burn with you.
5,0,0,No, it isn't. Yoga for Dummies is down the hall, second door on your hand with the carpet.
4,1,0,Is that the rug from the studio lobby?
5,0,0,Excuse me Sir, this is a yoga class, not a carpentry store!
3,2,0,Old school? Nice!
3,1,1,In your case 80% of success is NOT showing up.
5,0,0,Delivery new friend, unfurl and relax. We can move the new rug karma later.
5,0,0,What's the matter?
4,1,0,Any injuries?
3,2,0,Mat, not carpet. And please leave your shoes at the door. and your hat.................oh, never mind !
5,0,0,How about we start you in our pre-yoga class?
5,0,0,That ommm coming from your rug is our Yogi.
5,0,0,We don't do flying carpet lessons anymore.
5,0,0,Goodbye Ted. I'm sorry. It's not your energy, it's mine.
5,0,0,Please take off your shoes and socks, we practice barefoot.
5,0,0,I can't meditate on a plastic mat !
3,1,0,Bow, not bro
4,1,0,There is no 'I' in Yoga Mat!
5,0,0,I'm sorry, but the other students are experiencing mat envy.
5,1,0,Unfortunately, our schedule does not allow time for a ceremony to honor Mr. Berra.
4,0,1,Oh, one piece of advice- in here, the smaller the rug the greater the prestige
5,0,0,Opposites don't always attract, George!
5,0,0,No, I'm afraid using a bigger mat will not 'make yoga great again.'
5,0,0,Not that kind of bow down
4,1,0,I'm sorry, we don't allow performance enhancing rugs.
5,0,0,We don't allow full-size rugs in here. It makes the mats feel self-conscious.
4,1,0,I don't care if it's soft and fluffy.
5,0,0,Just lunge your way over to the yoga temple at the truck stop.
3,0,0,Are you going to kill and roll me up in that rug.
4,1,0,Good, now hold that position until you achieve yin.
4,1,0,Am I supposed to be impressed?
5,0,0,Can you help me unwind?
5,0,0,This is Yoga class, the "Aladdin" tryouts are down the hall.
4,1,0,Do you need help moving your furniture in?
1,3,0,We don't roll that way.
4,0,1,I'm sorry but your too well adjusted for our program.
5,0,0,No. 'Till the fat lady sings.' was his mantra.
5,0,0,Your karma is just pitiful.
5,0,0,Tell Cleopatra that Julius is not here on Monday's.
4,1,0,Only if it doesn't levitate.

5,0,0,Which way is Mecca?
5,0,0,Meditate on this: Oriental yoga matts are not permitted!
5,0,0,I insist. Men first!
5,0,0,Bringing your own mat does not mean stealing the one from the lobby.

4,1,0,Perhaps you were looking for the Fight Club down the street.
5,0,0,Harold realized too late that his "magic carpet" pick-up line would never work in a yoga class.
4,1,0,Please stop referring to it as the doggie pose, Lewis.
4,0,0,So I'm throwing around an idea for a new Broadway show, "Bikram Elliott.'
5,0,0,No we don't clean rugs as well.
5,0,0,Namaste. I suppose Home Depot was out of berber?
5,0,0,I said hot mat, not hot rug.
5,0,0,OK, the brochure says a gentler class comfortable for beginners, but that is not one of the recommended mats.
5,0,0,No, no cheese, I said chi.

4,1,0,My downward tapestry has really improved of late.
4,1,1,I'm sorry, but we can't be flexible.
2,3,0,How many in your party?
3,1,1,Yes, Dick, bringing a 5' x 8' carpet to yoga class is a form of manspreading.
3,2,0,No, the mat doesn't need to match the size of your ego.
5,0,0,No, no stomp class here. Try Drumpf's carpet bagging.
4,0,0,It'll come in handy when I start "Yoga for Rug Rats."
4,0,1,I see you're here for the Persian Yoga class.
4,0,0,An Eastern-looking rug is known to improve a true yogi's practice. That's a good investment in your yogic journey.
4,1,0,We can probably handle the rug and the shoes today, but I am going to say no to the lamp and the couch.
3,2,0,You'll have to remove your hat.
3,2,0,I'm sorry, but we don't allow Persians.
5,0,0,In yoga we use mats -- not runners, neither floor nor designated.
5,0,0,If you turn to your left you'll be facing East.
3,1,1,I hope you realize, that this will triple your class fee.

5,0,0,I've never had problems with size before.
4,0,1,You have the newbie mat until you stop toppling.
5,0,0,I'm sorry but "scatter rug" yoga is not a thing.

5,0,0,I came to get down.
3,1,0,Sorry, no manspreading.
5,0,0,I said a mat, not the living room rug!
4,0,0,You're early. Please let the Jolly Green Giant know his XXXXXXXL yoga workout doesn't begin until four.
5,0,0,Unwelcome karma, sir. No, not the mat, it's your NRA hat.
4,1,0,Our practice includes the idea that size does not matter.
5,0,0,Great first step. Now breathe.
4,1,0,Let's just start with an all natural diet
5,0,0,," "May the floors be with you."

5,0,0,Late for class after one of those 1001 nights again?
4,0,1,You don't look very stretchy.
4,0,0,No, I don't believe a magic rug will make the poses easier.
3,2,0,Okay, I'll check-in my sense of superiority if you check-in that carpet
4,1,0,You can start by getting your rug off of Barbara’s head.
5,0,0,Are you here to pray or stretch? No, we don't allow naps.
3,2,0,It's carpe diem, not carpet diem
5,0,0,what 'Room' ?
4,1,0,I am sorry, this is not Persian Yoga.
4,0,0,As your instructor, my initial advice would be to loose the magic carpet, the socks , the tennies, the gimme cap and your attitude.
3,2,0,Maybe EAST 23rd?
3,1,1,We're Reform Yoga here. You want the Orthodox place across the street.
5,0,0,You can't get to nirvana if you're fraying at the edges.

2,2,0,You know Yoga can be done at home too.
3,0,1,Is this a fashion statement or do you just not get it!
4,1,0,The cafe next door said someone just stole their rug.
4,1,0,Bob, you're supposed to take your shoes off at the door.
4,1,0,Mat envy, that's why!
5,0,0,Magic Carpet won't make you lose 20 lbs.

4,0,0,Ready for class 'Aladdin'?
0,3,1,We try to leave our rugged individualism at the door.
5,0,0,So you think a combo yoga mat, prayer rug and magic carpet satisfies diversity?
4,1,0,I can understand your attachment to your blankie but rules are rules.
5,0,0,I don't care if you can levitate. Your flying carpet is too big!
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but mats must be 100% unnatural.
4,1,0,We don't welcome Republicans.

5,0,0,Good, we won't have a wading pool like last week then.
5,0,0,Men: We're even rugged during Yoga
5,0,0,I said it was a yoga class, not a yogi class!
5,0,0,That kundalini pick-up line is so overused!
5,0,0,This is a yoga class. Not an audition for Aladdin.
3,1,1,I'm sorry, Sir. The flying carpet class ended at 11.
3,2,0,I'm sorry, but this is a rug-free zone.
5,0,0,I think you've got the yang covered.
5,0,0,You found it, stuffed away in an old drawer...!?...well, you need to think 'slip resistant'.
3,2,0,So that's whay they call you "big" Matt
4,1,0,I completely understand your feelings on this, but I'm just concerned your flying carpet will be an unnecessary distraction.
5,0,0,Is it your yoga rug, Rookie?
3,2,0,New years resolutions; am I right?
4,0,1,You're calling me 'inflexible'?
4,1,0,Who have you got in there?
5,0,0,We do Indian style here, not Persian.
4,0,0,I don't care if that's the real you. I'm not going out with you.
3,1,1,No hats.
5,0,0,It's not the size of the mat, it's the nirvana in the prana.
5,0,0,Your in the wrong place, try the MAGIC CARPET shop, it's next door.
3,2,0,Let's start with the cap and work our way down.
5,0,0,Don't you think a $5,000 Persian rug for yoga class is a bit ostentatious?
3,2,0,We are the nose-in-the-air Bow Down Yoga Club; The distasteful Rug Rat Yoga Group is down the street.
6,0,0,I'm not sure who told you that, but I can't help you fly that thing.
5,0,0,Tyler, do you always have to have the biggest mat?
5,0,0,Overcompensating is strictly prohibited.
5,0,0,I hope you brought a vacuum with you.
5,0,0,Sorry, but that outfit and that mat are only for home use.
4,1,0,The rug is ok but the couch stays outside

5,0,0,And who do we have here...Yoga Berra, perhaps?
4,1,0,You might find our practice a bit of a stretch.
3,1,1,Why do guys always have to have the biggest?
4,1,0,Aladdin's class doesn't start for another hour
4,1,0,Transcendence begins by removing the hat.
5,0,0,No, a large carpet will not make dual downward dog possible.
5,0,0,"Nice - but you know, not everything has to be about size all the time'...
4,1,0,Guys can be such imbeciles.
5,0,0,Let go of the rug, so we can achieve it.
4,1,0,I suppose re-purposing IS ecofriendly
4,0,1,Is there an elephant tusk in that rug or are you just happy to see me?
3,1,0,I suggest that you assume the Exiting Patron position.
5,0,0,Beginners carpetboarding is next door.
5,0,0,It was suicide-by-contemplation . . . dump him in Jersey.
4,1,0,I said size matters, inversely.
3,1,1,No..... Aladdin Yoga is NEXT Tuesday.
5,0,0,Ommmmmmmmm??
4,0,0," No, no! You don't need to use a prayer rug, just because we are called ' Bow Down Yoga ' !

4,1,0,Let me guess, you drive a Hummer

4,1,0,You muslims always think you can kill two birds with one stone.
4,0,0,I'm very flexible, but that mat is not welcome.
3,2,0,Size doesn't matter in yoga.
3,2,0,We're trying to become more authentic, ma'am.
3,2,0,Sorry, your mother was wrong, and she dresses you funny.
5,0,0,Size does matter! Sure, I''l share your mat.
4,1,0,I've never been worried about gentrification before.
3,1,1,The broga class is at ten.
5,0,0,It's not the size of your mat. It's the motion.
5,0,0,The difference is your Chakras know the difference. That's the difference.
3,2,0,Hipster yoga moved to the coffee shop next door.
4,0,1,Sure, yours is bigger than mine. Now, let's see you do a Pungu Mayurasana!

4,0,0,This is the billing address.
5,1,0,thank you but I did want his body buried with the rug.

5,0,0,Nope. It's not the same thing, at all.
5,0,0,Hi. I'm afraid we can't accept new members at the moment, I'm sorry. Many people seem to be looking for spirituality, at the moment. The elections, you know.
4,1,0,Looks like you really want to tie the room together.
4,1,0,'Make Yoga Great Again' is no longer at this location.
4,0,1,No Manspreading Here!
5,0,0,Is Arahant the same as Nirvana to you too?
5,0,0,No, I was not in fact aware that A-Rod said "flexibility is the new strength".
5,0,0,A good move for you would be to roll yourself up in that thing.
5,0,0,I see yoga does matter to you!
4,1,0,Bob,this class might not be for you.
4,1,0,We do yoga, we don't do perceptions of yoga.
4,1,0,Please take your "special rug" and move your asanas out of here.
3,1,1,Namaleave.

2,3,0,Well, at least you'll feel the burn.
4,0,0,You want more than your fair share, but you can't have it here, Mr. Trump.
3,0,1,Sir, shoes aren't allowed in the studio.
5,0,0,Magic carpet rides are not allowed.

5,0,0,I meant Pahlavani when I told you about Persian yoga.
6,0,0,Of course you did.
3,1,0,The dress code is sort of implied.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but we cancelled the order because Governor Christie has dropped the class.

4,0,0,Mine's bigger than yours!
4,0,1,Magic carpet class is next door, sir.
5,0,0,I don't care if you paid full price at Restoration Hardware.
4,0,1,Yoga doesn't have a shortstop position.
4,1,0,Cute. Did you bring you chez lounge as well?
4,1,0,This is the Bow Down studio. The DIY studio is on the second floor.
4,1,0,Okay Aladdin, unless that thing hovers over the class I suggest you get a normal sized mat like everyone else.
5,0,0,Our magic carpet class is on Sundays.
5,0,0,Home Depot is next door.
4,1,0,You want "Takedown Yoga" next door.
4,1,0,Your safe space is intruding on my safe space.
3,2,0,Don't you have any friends of your own Bob?
4,0,0,And I would ALSO appreciate it if you DIDN'T make follow-up comments to mine, such as "What up, Downward Dog?"
5,0,0,Class cost is by the square foot.
6,0,0,"Bro-Ga" has been cancelled.
5,0,0,You can put my sister down anywhere?
3,1,1,C'mon, man. It really ties the studio together.
5,0,0,The yogic flying class took off 30 minutes ago.
4,1,0,Yoga-tta be kidding me.
4,1,0,The Kama Sutra class is next week.
6,0,0,My downward dog had worms
4,0,1,Have you seen Alice?
5,0,0,Is your moving truck double parked?
4,1,0,I promise to take the needs of Yoga Dads into consideration.
1,2,1,We meditate, not levitate.
4,0,1,but is it artisanal?
4,0,0,This is the last time you sneak in your yoga buddy.
5,0,0,Persia is not known as a yoga mat manufacturing centre.
5,0,0,No you can't bring your dog, it's Bow Down Yoga, not Bow Wow
3,2,0,That would have to be the early evening family class
2,2,1,You'd be surprised how inflexible we can sometimes be.
5,0,0,Miley's here.
4,1,0,May I take your brother's measurements as long as he's here?
3,2,0,Let me guess--first time doing yoga?
4,1,0,The fact that it's fair trade doesn't make it more appropriate.
5,0,0,The BYO class is downstairs.
5,0,0,Planning on expanding your practice, I assume?
5,0,0,Seriously? That's your yoga mat? It had better be hypo-allergenic, that's all I'm saying...
5,0,0,Did you get in with the two-for-one special?
5,0,0,If there's a body in there, you have to leave.
5,0,0,Yes, we believe yoga is a religious experience. No, you cannot bring your own prayer rug.
4,1,0,No rug, and no throne either.
5,0,0,This is Hatha, not Mansplay yoga.
5,0,0,This is hot yoga, not poor yoga.
5,0,0,I'm sure it is Old School but I'm still charging you double.
4,0,0,What's with the rug, Matt?
5,0,0,We all sweat a lot. You still can't use a ShamWow rug.
4,1,0,We don't accept Groupons.
4,0,1,I don't care if you are an artisan bread baker for Subway, you're not using that mat.
4,1,0,Please understand that we have only recently overcome the last flea infestation.
5,0,0,You won't find your Jasmine here, Aladdin.
5,0,0,I heard the World was ending, and wanted to ask God if he could postpone this event a one more time.
5,0,0,"Get out of the well. Stop playing with that ceiling roller and give me a help".
6,0,0,We're promoting mat diversity.
4,0,1,For the last time, no. And stop having pizzas delivered during class, too.
4,1,0,Now you know why Shavasana translates as "corpse pose."
5,0,0,What are you, Old Nick?
2,2,1,We're here to stretch, Jimmy, not to fly.
5,0,0,I'm guessing you drove over here in your Hummer.
5,0,0,Unless there's someone named Matt rolled up in there, you misinterpreted my instructions.
3,2,0,That's so uncool; and besides your ex left 15 minutes ago.
5,0,0,It is not just a yoga mat, it is a yoga flying carpet.
5,0,0,No, you may not market 'PhatMats' here.
4,1,0,I see from your magic carpet you are looking for yogic flying. It's next door
4,1,0,No, you can't just 'drop a body off' here.
5,0,0,Not Mysore, eyesore.
5,0,0,Nobody said “no carpet” This mat is not even on the market yet. This isn’t the carpet class, right? My wife said something about laying down in Yoga class.
4,1,0,I think you're more of a runner than a yogi.
5,0,0,Sorry, but you won't achieve enlightenment any faster with a dhurrie rug.
5,0,0,Namaste. The centre's special 'yoga for chubby, clueless beginners' class is next door.
5,0,0,Forget it Harold. Nobody cares that it really ties the room together.
4,1,0,You 'enlightened'? Not when your carpet is made of non-sustainable fibers.
4,1,0,I'm sorry, but the ad clearly said, 'Enjoy the comforts of Om.'
5,0,0,Is that your mat or are you just happy to see me?
5,0,0,You may think you're the big dog here, but I'm the alpha dog.
5,0,0,I ordered that nine months ago.
4,1,0,Sweetie, The Kamasutra themed class was a joke.
5,0,0,Let's start with downward-facing Saint Bernard.
4,1,0,It's not the size of your mat, it's the angle of your downward facing dog that matters.
5,0,0,Just because your "mat" is Persian does not mean we're not flexible.
3,0,1,No, I will NOT come home to vacuum.
4,1,0,...While I appreciate that yours is a magic carpet, we only allow the use of simple matts that complete the necessary illusion of proper suffering.
4,0,0,I said carpe diem!
5,0,0,Excellent mountain pose. Now make like a tree.
4,1,0,I'm sorry sir, but I've never seen The Big Lebowski.
2,2,1,I see that you roll your own.
4,1,0,The flying carpet class meets on the roof.
5,0,0,"You'll have to loose the hat".
5,0,0,The persian class was cancelled.
4,1,0,No, sir. You may not show me the world.
5,0,0,The carpet rolling class is in Studio C - between aerial ribbion and poll dancing.
5,0,0,Flying carpets are not allowed, Aladdin.
5,0,0,The Broga session is in the basement.
2,2,0,Manspreading is reserved for our advanced class.
5,0,0,Look, for the last time. You're not Aladdin and you can't show me the world.
4,0,1,In retrospect, this may have been too much of a stretch for a first date.
2,3,0,Flying lessons are next door.
5,0,0,Where do you want the body?
3,2,0,Hold that pose right there until it hurts.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, I just broke up with a Persian.
5,0,0,And when will the furniture be arriving?
2,2,0,When will you learn that size doesn't matter?!
3,0,1,Sometimes an exercise mat is just an exercise mat.
4,0,1,Overcompensation is an obstacle to spiritual pathways, Sir.
5,0,0,No, this is slim flexible yoga . . . regular guy's yoga is at the bar next door.
4,1,0,I appreciate that you wove it yourself but it is not the standard size.
3,1,0,You may have a rug, but you don't have a prayer.
5,0,0,Think of the possibilities.
5,0,0,No, we don't supply padding.
3,2,0,Your parents' basement is two doors down.
4,0,0,No, I don't want to go on a magic carpet ride.
5,0,0,Oh, how sweet, that's so last millennium
5,0,0,Wash it in cold, then dry it on high.
3,2,0,Really? You want to man spread in here?
5,0,0,Your transport awaits.
2,2,1,If you can make that carpet fly, yes. Otherwise, no.
5,0,0,Hello, Matthew.
4,0,1,If there's a dead body in rolled up in there, I'm not paying extra.
4,1,0,Where do youse guys normally dispose of your used, uh, yoga mats?
6,0,0,I understand your need to reduce the confusion, Matt, but that's a rug....
5,0,0,It's about your shoe size
3,1,0,I'm here to set up for Aladdin's 2 o'clock.
3,0,1,Are you sharing that joint with all of us?
5,0,0,Sir, this rug Nama-STAYS on the floor.
4,1,0,You're right. A rug does make it feel like there's no place like "om".
5,0,0,The beginners class is at noon. Ok, well I'll be back and namaste to you.
3,1,1,Why would I know the direction to Mecca?
3,2,0,Even if yoga did originate in Persia the answer is still "NO:.
4,0,1,Are you disposing of a body?
5,0,0,I could see, how much the studio's slogan "Come & Relax mind and body" inspired you.
4,0,1,Yes you do have to take out the body first.
5,0,0,It was given to me by a Yoga Genie
2,1,2,No, no, no. Not “namaste”. I said you and the rug must not stay.
4,1,0,Well, maybe Yoga isn't for everyone after all.
3,1,0,Prayer rugs are a different tradition...
5,0,0,You really should not be forcing your girlfriend to come to class.
5,0,0,Hi madam, My name's Wilbur, and I'm here to join your yoga class. I figure, if all else fails me, I can count on my magic carpet.
5,0,0,Yoga and levitation will cost you extra.
5,0,0,Persian Sufi Hatha refers to the technique, Matt. Not the mat, Matt!
3,2,0,Flying lessons are on the Top Floor
4,1,0,Trump Yoga is across the street.
4,0,1,I can see our website needs to be more specific.
5,0,0,We're a hot yoga studio and you're not hot.
5,0,0,I need a bigger mat, there are no half measures with me...
5,0,0,Meditate this Junior. We accept no snakes.
4,1,0,No, there's no sitting watching football asana.
5,0,0,I'm here to drop off a corpse pose...
4,1,0,Pick a remote dumpster..no questions please.
5,0,0,Yes I did say to make your mat your "home" during class but...
5,0,0,And, it's Namaste, not "have a nice day".
5,0,0,Sorry, but posers aren't welcome here.
4,0,1,Take off your hat. I want to see if the drapes match your carpet.
5,0,0,She DOES matter, but in this case, smaller is better!
5,0,0,I think you heard me. I said "That was zen, this is tao."
5,0,0,It's what's on the inside that counts.
5,0,0,Cleopatra just left
4,0,1,No, thanks. I have plans.
5,0,0,we really don't allow solicitors.
4,0,0,I don't think that's what "old school" entails.
0,2,0,No problem—we're very flexible.
5,0,0,This is really going to throw off my savasana.
2,1,2,No, broga is on Thursdays.
5,0,0,No, you cannot hide that body here.
4,1,0,Let me guess, You're the new guy who called to say he was bringing a Matt with him.
5,0,0,Relax. Magic Carpet 101 is just down the hall -- second door on the right.
4,0,0,This is Hatha Yoga, sir, not Haha Yoga.
5,0,0,I think first we should discuss the way in which you parked your car.
5,0,0,Tell Mr. Trump he's not welcome.
4,1,0,This is Bikram. Persian is next door.
5,1,0,Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at Party Down Yoga?
5,0,0,Look he just wants to have a normal day where someone can do yoga on him without having to sign autographs, take pictures, or give out magic carpet rides so please leave us in peace.
4,1,0,I don't care if that is your ride Mr. Aladdin.
3,1,0,Absolutely not! The last guy left with a woman rolled up inside.
4,1,0,I can't believe you wore that hat here.
5,0,0,You're what kind of Doctor?
3,1,1,This is Bikram yoga; Berber yoga is next door.
5,0,0,Sorry, the "Fragile Flowers" class is tomorrow.
4,0,0,Everyone pays, no matter how they get in!
5,0,0,Matt, I know you're heteroflexible.
4,0,1,And then weight it down and dump her in the river.
5,0,0,You'll need to come back tomorrow for the beginning Yoga Fashion class.
4,0,1,Your first yoga class?
5,0,0,What a loser.
4,1,0,The yuppie in me honours the men's rights activist in you.
5,0,0,You can't bring your flying carpet and hope for a miracle.
2,3,0,No, sorry, it's not a whole new world yet.
5,0,0,While we respect your enthusiasm and unique style, we just don't feel the intermediate class is quite ready for you yet.
4,1,0,A "patina of cat hair" does not count as "chi".
4,1,0,Sorry. No carpet bow-downing allowed here.
5,0,0,We already forgot lesson one, didn't we?
5,0,0,How inadequate is inadequate enough?
5,0,0,But we don't need a flying carpet here
5,0,0,I need a lot of room when I do yoga, ok. Do you really need that much room?
4,0,1,This must be your first time.
4,0,1,Can we please just go see a movie?
5,0,0,Yes normally that's true, but with this I am not flexible
3,2,0,No, you may not bring a pillow next time.
5,0,0,What so I'm no longer welcome here with my yoga carpet?
5,0,0,This isn't a grateful dead concert
4,0,1,The rug burns are how I know it's working.
5,0,0,Unless that's magic, it's not gonna fly here.
4,1,0,I'm getting tired of Ms. Cleopatra's grand entrances.
5,0,0,Scram! You can't do yoga wearing a hat.
3,1,0,The first thing is to inhale through your nose, then exhale out the door.
5,0,0,You can tell Aladdin there is a whole new yoga studio down the block.
4,1,0,To be honest, we've never tried aggressive self-realization.
5,0,0,It's not enough that I have to deal with the hat.
5,0,0,Does the texture of your mat improve your Downward Facing Dog?
5,0,0,Many of us do achieve great personal growth.
5,0,0,I don't CARE if your name is Matt.
4,1,0,Was your mother a large woman?
3,1,1,We're missing a customer.
5,0,0,Magic Carpet Ride is next door Mr Trump
4,1,0,Please Bill, you just don't get it!
4,1,0,Nice mat Aladdin.
4,0,0,Full-contact ashtanga is the next studio over.
4,0,0,I may have put up with your abuse of thesaurus.com but I’m not your English professor anymore.
5,0,0,It's Indian, not Persian.
3,3,0,Yogis don't teach you how to fly like Aladdin.
4,1,0,I know your name is Matt. And the thing you're carrying you call a mat. But that is not a yoga mat, Matt.
4,0,0,The funeral home is in the next block.
5,0,0,Planning to abduct someone?
5,0,0,Sorry for asking sweetie, but I just can't tell the pitchers from catchers anymore.
5,0,0,I'll let you know when it's time for Downward Persian Dog.
5,0,0,Bow Wow Dog Training is down the street.
5,0,0,This is Bow Down Yoga... NOT... Lay Down and Nap!
2,0,0,I don't think those are the piles yoga is supposed to help.
5,0,0,I said 'yoga"'party", not 'toga' party.
4,0,0,I'm sorry, but the hipster doofus yoga studio is located above the ironic vintage t-shirt shop across the street.
4,1,0,Is this your first time at yoga?
4,1,0,Your outfit is bringing me down, dog.
4,0,0,You will be charged double for that sized mat!
5,0,0,Shake out your mat, Frank--we're missing Mr. Whimpley.
5,0,0,Put that in the corner. It's for my dog, Downward.
5,1,0,I'm afraid yoga is more of a mid-century modern lifestyle.
5,0,0,I'm sorry, you may not nameste.
4,1,0,Really? A "power carpet" for Power Yoga?
4,1,0,I think your college buddies were pulling your leg. There is no instructor here named Alladin!
4,0,1,I'd rather eat glass than fly with you to India.
5,0,0,Whoever told you size does not matter was wrong.
4,0,0,We don't teach the Persian Hostage Pose.
5,0,0,Not a good idea if that's an Iranian prayer rug.
4,0,1,What? Are you pimping your ride?
5,0,0,The Magic Carpet Ride class meets on the roof. Good luck!
4,1,0,One: take your shoes off in my studio. Two: that's a tapestry.
5,0,0,And yes, I promise you that I will never ask you to eat kale again.
5,0,0,Sorry, we do not allow rugrats.
5,0,0,What do you mean 'your chahra is blocked by my studio's feng shui'?
5,0,0,MAT, Mr. Donaldson, mat!
5,0,0,No shoes and hats sir.
4,0,1,We only give yoga lessons. Flying lessons are two doors down.
5,0,0,Take your magic carpet and beat it, Alladin. The only way you'll ever reach a higher plane is on a sticky mat!
4,0,1,The sign says no Flying carpets.
4,1,0,Magic carpet riding lessons are Thursday evenings at 8:00.
5,0,0,One day you will also keep the seat down!
5,0,0,Puraney khayalat?
5,0,0,Breathe in and now Breathe OW!
5,0,0,Take whats left of that mouth breather to the woodchipper.
5,0,0,This is a Yoga, not a Thug class!!
4,1,0,From Texas?
4,1,0,Excuse me, but I am reasonably sure we are not zoned for that!
5,0,0,You can get rid of the stiff out back.
5,0,0,You said I needed to take your hobbies more seriously.
5,0,0,I'm afraid you'll have to leave your flying carpet outside.
3,0,1,I'm sorry, sir, but under our agreement with the college, we can appropriate only one culture at a time.
5,0,0,I see you're feeling the rug Bern.
5,0,0,"You're the second guy to come in looking to do a class while on Persian rugs".
5,0,0,Yoga for yokels is on the third floor.
3,2,0,No Mr. Trump the size of your Rug will not make Yoga Class Great Again
5,0,0,Sorry sir, we don't offer fringe benefits at this studio.
5,0,0,No, no, it's not downward facing rug.
5,0,0,I'm here to see a-hole new world.
4,1,0,We don't roll that way here.
4,1,0,You must have some heavy meditating on your mind.
4,0,1,So you're THAT guy, huh?
3,1,1,No, the complaints have not been about your baseball cap.
4,0,0,No we have no plans to change from mats to rugs.
5,0,0,Usually my clients come here voluntarily.
2,2,0,You're early. Flying Carpet yoga starts tomorrow.
5,0,1,If its a magic carpet, make it smaller.
4,0,0,I don't care if it flew you from Bagdad to Laguardia, it's still too lumpy to use here.
4,1,0,I don't care if you have a sensitive butt.
3,2,0,Your first pose will be one I call "Restraining Order."
5,0,0,You want to be great again?
5,0,0,Get properly dressed for the Dust Salutation.
5,0,0,Your mat will really tie the room together.
3,1,0,The practice actually originates in Persia.
4,1,0,Sorry, we don't teach the "Tie the Room Together" position.
4,1,0,No Sir, you cannot align your "mat" to Mecca.
2,2,1,Your failure to follow instructions is restricting my infinite bliss.
5,0,0,I'm a lumberjack too, and I don't care either!
4,1,0,Please put that back in the reception area and I will lend you a mat for today.
3,1,0,Yogi's is down the road. "It's crowded so no one goes there anymore." doesn't work here.
4,1,0,I think we are going to have to charge you for two!
4,0,0,It's yoga, not Alladin
5,0,0,As part of our anti-Trump campaign we now offer 5 Bow Down sessions daily.
3,1,0,Yes, we are all in this together, but you do realize it's $1,468 per square foot don't you?
5,0,0,I'm sorry that removing the whole carpet was kind of a big stretch.
4,1,0,For greater harmony and unity, we require a matte blue mat.
