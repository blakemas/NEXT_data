37,4,2,You will not live to regret agreeing to a small arms duel!
36,4,1,You're DRAGON this out!
34,5,0,Do you mind if I sit back a little? Because your breath is very bad---it really is.
39,9,1,Next round I can use my right hand and you can spew fire
32,2,1,I clearly have more delegates than you do...
33,2,1,Saint George! You're the guy that slew my Pa!
33,7,0,It's not rigged. These are the rules.
57,23,6,You've lost that fire in the belly, Puff!
37,7,1,I just thought getting out of your comfort zone would make you more empathic, leading us to a healthier conflict resolution.
29,3,0,Then you thrust, then you parry, then you plie... don't worry, it will come with practice.
34,3,2,Hold on, I have a blindfold for you too.
29,1,0,The smoldering dragon.
28,0,0,Now THIS is epeec.
41,12,1,Are you aware that I can fire you at will?
32,4,0,Stop huffing and puffing, and start fighting!
37,3,2,Next week I'll bring my flame thrower.
42,6,2,As a fire marshall, I am afraid I can not allow this smoking violation to drag on.
43,12,3,I thought you gave up smoking.
33,3,0,Stop fuming under your fire breath... you agreed to the "Rules of Engagement" to a sword fight, so en garde!
54,16,7,Come on, fight like a man!
38,10,1,I hate these politically correct fights
34,8,0,Hey! No smoking either.
29,2,0,Smoking will kill you before I do.
41,7,3,Tiny shield? Sure. But watch how I wield it, baby.
29,1,0,I said Smaug, not flog!
31,5,0,Why oh why did I pick sword fight?
55,20,6,See? It's not only fair, it's more fun!
36,2,2,Stupid emissions standards.
34,7,1,Allergies?
30,2,0,My turn to choose the weapons. I choose flame throwing nostrils at twenty paces.
30,2,0,Oy vey. I thought Dungeons and Dragons was SO yesterday already.
32,2,1,That toothpick might help, but have you considered flossing?
28,2,0,Dragon or not, everyone goes through same basic training
34,8,1,My dragon pose is very relaxing
32,1,1,The "Mother Of my Dragons" would never make me work this hard...
29,2,0,A sword? Are you kiddin' me? This punk should be toasted -- not shishkabobbed.
30,3,0,Ay, marry, by the rood, thou hast the foulest breath in the kingdom!
32,1,1,Keith Haring called. He wants his shield back.
47,10,4,It sucks when your pilot light goes out, doesn't it?
32,3,0,I should have paid more attention in Dragon Slaying class
29,2,0,This is not what i expected in the medieval times.
27,1,0,You're lucky I'm from New York.
31,4,1,Marriage counseling would have been easier.
32,5,0,See? Isn't this more fun than shooting those silly old flames?
87,17,23,I'll teach you to frolick in the autumn mist!
38,9,2,We could go back to air guitar.
37,9,1,Why can't we resolve this with Rock, Paper, Scissors?
32,5,0,Aha! I am not left-handed either!
44,13,2,It's not my fault the EPA banned fire-breathing.
33,3,1,Next time, little man, I get to choose the forum and debate rules.
32,1,1,Would it help if I told you I can get you in to meet Peter Dinklage?
32,1,1,You bet against Leicester City, so I get to pick weapons
33,2,1,Did you know you have bad breath?
30,0,0,On guard, I am the dragon slayer, here to save the day.
34,5,2,Take that, Lefty.
34,5,1,Mom always said the fencing lessons would pay off.
35,9,0,Out of puff, are we?
29,2,0,On second thought, maybe we DO need to get cable.
47,8,5,Without the new carbon emmission regulations you wouldn't have a chance!
33,2,1,I'm not sure Hansel is worth this...
29,3,0,I still think it's only fair if we both fight left-handed.
46,3,5,Wait! Do you have a small arm too or were we both drawn badly.
29,1,0,This would be more fun if you hadn't thrown out the barrel.
30,1,1,Another Jackie Paper impostor.
34,6,1,No, it's you who is under-compensating.
46,8,5,An excess of hubris with regard to their swordfighting abilities ulitmately doomed dragon-kind.
29,1,0,This levels the playing field.
42,13,1,The loser pays for lunch.---- No the loser is lunch.
34,3,1,Little Jackie Paper after rehab
25,1,0,Are you related to Trogdor?
32,5,0,One of the perils of quitting smoking---not firing up!
30,3,0,"Easy GAME OF THRONES extra gig" they said.
29,3,0,Stupid 'no fire' rule.
29,2,0,Didn't I tell you too many e-cigarettes would give me the upper hand?
38,6,5,Don't get me wrong, but have you considered alternating your leg and back workouts with arms, core, and cardio?
51,13,5,This is my last Renaissance Faire. I am so burnt out.
32,4,0,Wow That was a drink!
30,1,1,Oh, you gonna call your mommy?
42,7,3,Don't you recognize me? I'm Jackie Paper
32,2,1,Those alligator arms aren't going to get your out of this broil
29,3,0,Arg - dragon breath...
40,6,3,And next I’m going to beat you at arm-wrestling.
40,2,0,Who’s got the fire in the belly now?
53,18,6,Take it easy, I wasn't referring to you when I said small arms.
34,0,2,I'm Puff The Magic Dragon, you idiot.
41,5,3,This will look good on your college application.
45,7,5,Let's make this look realistic.When I pretend to stab you, fall down, OK?
35,11,0,You call this a workout? Cmon, make me feel the burn!
35,2,2,You should have gone with pistols at twenty paces.
29,4,0,Next time I get the choice of weapons.
27,2,0,Why are there rules of fighting with swords in the coliseum?
40,3,0,Puff you're right, this will help with my withdrawal anxiety.
32,2,1,NBC's "How to Train Your Dragon: Live"
38,6,2,You should have a shield to make this a fair fight.
41,8,3,That's the last time I'll say 'choose your weapon.'"
32,4,0,I can't believe I let him talk me into 'Rock,Paper,Scissors'!
56,22,4,I never fight fire with fire.
33,5,1,It didn't work this way on Game of Thrones!
29,2,0,Ecofriendly Dragozor chooses not to burn his breath-gas, and instead reuses the cocktail pick from his cherry vodka sour.
33,3,1,The unicorn wasted enough of my time. I can't let this drag on.
29,1,0,It ain't gonna work, kid. St, George wasn't a southpaw.
47,12,4,If you put down the sword I'll try to get you an interview at Geico.
28,2,0,Embrace the dark side, Puff.
27,0,0,I liked the game much more before the agents and lawyers got involved.
28,1,0,I feel a historical moment coming on
34,5,1,Now all we need are marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers and we've got s'mores!
34,10,0,We're not in Honnah Lee anymore!
37,5,2,So where do you sheath that thing, anyway?
38,7,3,No fair using fire, or I'm telling mom!
27,1,1,ONLY THIS KNIGHT CAN PREVENT WILDFIRES.
36,7,1,Try again, but get your breath closer to the spark.
30,0,1,Bernie vs Hillary OR vice versa
29,3,0,Same time tomorrow?
39,6,3,Gadzooks! The day I'm having!
34,4,2,When I auditioned for a part on "Game of Thrones", this wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
29,1,0,No, I will not give you $3.50.
34,7,0,You're the one they call Lefty?
32,4,0,Can we try rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock instead?
38,8,1,How long are we going to let this feud drag-on?
29,2,0,Is Mother of Dragons home?
33,5,0,This raw diet is entirely too much work!
38,3,3,This fight seems to just drag-on...
32,1,1,How about we arm-wrestle instead? Left arms only.
37,5,3,You realize you're the last of your breed ?
45,6,3,Are you sure the right is your dominant hand?
28,1,0,My name is NOT "Puff the Magic Dragon". After I eat you for lunch, you will understand.
38,5,1,Now i know what they mean about dragon breathe.
27,0,0,This is fun, but I feel bad my cousin in Whiterun. He's been stuck on guard duty since he took that arrow in the knee.
32,5,0,You are a formidable opponent....breathing fire, sharp horns, spiked tail. But your thrust and parry are horrendous.
37,8,1,What, you never heard of fighting fire with fire?
35,1,0,Your 'fire-in-the-belly' aggressiveness could be toned down with Tums.
30,2,0,OK..now you be St. George.
30,3,0,Stop complaining—you agreed to swords when you arrived.
47,6,6,A fire-mouthed, horned monster, and everyone was just worried about his small hands
39,5,1,You must share your bathroom!
30,1,1,My brother-in-law is a sword wielding, fire breathing dragon. Do you know him?
29,0,0,This is ridiculous!
34,2,2,Damn, he's a lefty, I'll have to burn him.
27,0,0,Stop complaining. I respect your professionalism for wanting to play to win but wthout parity in the Professional Dragonslayers League we'er both out of a job.
31,3,0,I'd like to do a little cardio before I make a meal out of you.
41,7,3,Have you tried mouthwash?
33,2,1,With my ridiculous shield and your baby arms, we're getting nowhere fast. Let's bang our swords together a few more times then head out to the Fox & Goose for a cool one.
31,3,0,You must be David.
37,7,0,This job used to be fun before they made me sign the "no charbroiling" clause.
39,8,2,Wait! What I said is my ass is draggin'!
30,2,0,I ran out of gas, thus the sword.
29,3,0,Lay down your weapon and surrender peacefully.
36,7,1,What have you been smokin', Puff?
35,4,1,See! It's always better to have a real skill.
40,7,1,Amazon said they'd be bigger.
32,5,1,I don't even get a shield? This game is rigged.
34,4,1,Are you feeling the burn yet?
51,18,7,Cut! Refuel the dragon.
36,4,2,Yeah, well Puff the Magic Dragon is gonna trash your middle age spread.
38,7,2,There must be an easier way to win a woman's heart.
56,17,8,Do I smell damsel on your breath?
34,3,1,Note to self: DO NOT use 'Pardon me but do you have a match?' trick.
36,5,2,The caucus system ensures it's a fair fight.
37,10,0,How about that breath mint?
35,10,1,Jab me again and you're walking home.
59,18,9,Yes, and I would rather be using a lance, so it IS fair.
40,7,2,It's always just pistols or sabers. Fire's never an option.
38,5,2,Stop calling me 'Lefty'...it's insensitive.
41,11,3,Your breath smells like Sir Robert.
38,10,1,Your tiny arms slay me.
30,1,0,Let's see how he does in the fire-breathing round.
29,2,0,Peter the Dragon-Slayer-Slayer
25,1,0,Apparently Pete didn't tell you about Attaque au Fer.
31,1,1,En Garde. And no fair incinerating me with your breath.
31,2,0,Aren't you glad you gave up smoking and fire breathing?
28,0,0,Let's quit! We are mismatched hands.
28,1,0,Ha ha, I beat you again, You stink at this game. You have no way to beat me. Ha ha.
30,4,0,Now that you've got a sword you're not allowed to spit fire
28,4,0,There! Now let's see you fight fire with fire.
28,0,0,I think it's time to go home.
37,7,1,You're so touchy about your small hands!
41,10,2,I didn't know you were right handed.
35,4,2,Hey it's not my fault you forgot your lighter.
31,1,0,Big obstacles, Extra large solutions. I'm a warrior...
35,7,1,I'm hoping the concept will be picked up by HBO!
36,7,1,Now thrust.
46,11,4,YOUR mom has dragon breath.
39,5,3,No! No! Left paw behind back-spread legs, then parry.
27,0,0,En garde, ready, go!
34,8,0,See? A level playing field!
33,3,1,Quit complaining. It's the same system they use in golf.
34,5,1,Ok, once more, and we’ll take a break. This time, keep your wings behind you, and don’t let your opponent make you mad.
31,4,0,Now was that parry, parry, thrust or thrust, thrust, parry?
36,3,2,Hey, no fire breathing! This is a zero-emission dragon slaying.
37,8,1,It's not fair when you wear a flame retardant suit.
36,5,1,I should've known your sword would be so small. You have Trump hands!
29,1,0,No pun intended, but using shish kabob skewers makes the steaks clear.
42,8,5,Back off! I'm an endangered species you idiot!
38,9,1,'Or the other way we settle this is I get you to offset your emissions in a carbon trading scheme'
31,3,0,Can we finish this quickly so I don't miss the new Game of Thrones episode?
30,3,0,Sometimes I wonder why we even bother to do this anymore.
40,5,3,Why yes, it is a RED shirt.
30,2,0,You lose a glove ?
52,13,8,So, when did you switch to vaping?
30,1,1,Damn these sort dragon arms!
36,7,1,Al Gore fighting global warming
34,6,1,Bend at the knees and lunge... and smile. I SAID, SMILE!
36,5,1,Remember, this is just practice, so don't sneeze!!
40,4,3,No fair! You have a shield!
30,4,0,I am NOT cheating! This is just what happens when I breathe.
31,3,0,You're frustrated. Let's try mumblety-peg.
30,2,0,To be fair, you are the dragon.
38,2,0,In all fairy tales the dragon dies and the man wins...but not this time
31,3,0,Not fair! Your sword is longer.
30,2,0,Determined to rescue the beautiful dragon princess, Shmaug swallowed his fear and set out to slay the terrible Sir John outside his mountain lair.
33,2,1,It's so exciting to finally Meet you! I've been waiting for eight seasons.
31,4,0,You really slay me. Not.
42,10,2,You really should exercise both arms equally.
29,1,0,Lighten up, you're so sensitive. Can't you take a joke?
34,2,1,Hodor
24,3,0,If only we were on cable...
30,1,1,Quit blowing smoke, Dragon, and fight me with everything you've got.
42,9,3,Perhaps this "sainthood" thing is overrated.
37,4,2,And if they attack like this...block an parry.
32,4,0,Brexit doesn't amuse me, Georgie
39,9,3,Next time, I get to choose the weapon.
31,2,1,Guess I fell asleep playing video games again.
42,12,2,And I had to say, "Choose your weapon."
29,1,0,Look at my hands - are they small hands?
31,3,0,This episode of "Game of Thrones" is really pushing my credibility.
30,3,0,Halt! I'm shielded by the endangered species list.
39,7,2,As Puff aged, he needed a backup plan.
26,2,0,Combatants and spectators will all need to work through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
45,17,1,Don't get so fired up this time, concentrate on your footwork
31,3,0,Have you seen any good monster movies lately?
38,1,0,Wait until you have to sneeze with your jaw is wired shut.
33,1,2,shall we practice with the epee next?
29,3,0,Your not as HOT as you think>
37,4,3,Sorry, dude, liability issue.
51,19,4,How not to train your dragon.
29,1,0,Asymmetrical!
36,11,0,You're no Errol Flynn.
47,10,4,Good grief, I meant to grab my pen.
38,4,3,I can beat you with my left hand!
29,1,0,I am prepared this time, I am not a liar.
35,8,0,Uh-oh. Never bring a sword to a firefight.
48,8,7,You'll feel a bigger sense of accomplishment if you beat me on my terms.
32,5,0,Be a good sport, Puff... roll over and die.
29,2,0,I asked for my pipe and my flagon, but they brought you, you viperous dragon!
27,0,0,What happened to the candle and the water?!
33,5,0,My name is Grendel; got that? Grendel. Not Puff.
36,6,1,Aw, come on. Get into it. Spit some fire!
34,7,0,Quit bellyaching. I could have chosen tilting.
37,3,1,If you don't blow your smoke on me I won't spit on you.
28,1,0,When I made that comment I did not realize how big a Team Jacob fan you are.
37,7,1,Wow! Did you see that move? I'm on FIRE now!
32,4,0,This isn't as fun since you went solar!
49,12,5,Little Jackie Paper grew up to become a huge pain in the ass.
29,2,0,Wanna join the King's Guards? Beat me in swords, you are in!
42,5,5,You know what I'm thinking? Try switching to your shorter arm to see if that's more comfortable for you.
34,7,1,Remember - you wanted to flip for choice of weapon!
32,2,1,See? I told you this was more humane than jousting
48,13,4,I sense you're unhappy with the new handicapping rules...
41,7,3,Thanks for honoring my aversion to second-hand smoke.
32,2,1,Did the fire in the furnace die out?
59,14,11,I never realized that knights were real
42,10,3,Now remember, make it look good. The damsel in distress is watching.
31,2,0,You cannot win if you're holding back!
33,4,1,I think your cocktail pick is missing an olive.
47,13,4,Oh, quit fuming. You get to choose weapons tomorrow.
34,6,0,And then he said "You'll never work in Hollywood again!"
46,10,2,You're going easy on me, aren't you?
29,1,0,Our crossfit instructor says to hold this lunge for 4 more seconds and that should complete our WOD (Workout for the Day)
63,25,7,And now you say "touché!" Isn't this more fun?!
44,8,5,Remember, only you can prevent dragon fires.
33,2,0,"David and who-liath ??
34,5,1,This is only one upside of having opposable thumbs!
34,6,1,En garde, Monsieur Puff!
37,13,0,You don't know much about arms control .
33,5,1,My name is Inigo Montoya. I am not left-handed.
38,6,1,You never reach for the check.
37,4,1,I should have known not to bring a knife to a dragon fight.
37,7,2,Thanks for being such a good sport.
36,7,1,Thoughts on using your left hand?
31,3,0,Joe the Small-Armed Dragon found a way around his fatal flaw.
35,3,1,Your demands for fair play are wearing thin.
38,5,2,I know you're burnt out. But this is ridiculous.
32,5,0,You do realize that this "short arm" thing isn't really going to help you.
27,1,0,Serves me right for being a vegetarian.
48,10,4,Stop, in accordance with the European Clean Air Act of 1434 !
32,1,1,See,like this? There,that's how you do it. You're learning so well. I'm proud of you! One day you'll surely reach my level of expertise!
37,8,1,I'm getting tired of your constant complaints about the rules being 'rigged'.
46,12,3,A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.
28,0,0,What do you mean by that? You knew I was in the monkey business when I married you!
33,5,0,Say, the new PETA regulations aren't that bad at all!
34,7,0,Oh stop whining! I won the coin toss fair & square.
27,0,0,Size doesn't matter
31,3,0,It's the latest thing - asymmetrical warfare.
31,2,0,I still
33,7,1,It's not as much fun when it's an even fight, is it?
34,2,1,Why did I sign up for this fencing class.
40,12,2,I am sorry I said your hands were small.
29,2,0,Smaug revises his opinion of the TPP.
42,10,2,Don't complain, Smokey! We could have chosen binding arbitration...
38,2,3,OK, big fella - I promise - next time YOU get to choose the weapons.
40,2,0,"Paper, I know you have grown up, but either we go back to strings and sealing wax, or you are toast.
31,4,0,You know, you and I - we're much alike.
43,7,4,My wife asked for a knight out dueling some thing hot and horny.
32,3,0,That never worked for the big bad wolf
30,2,0,My name is irrelevant, prepare to die.
48,9,7,Does this sword make my arms look short?
29,2,0,I wish a sling shot was available.But he picked swords.
32,5,0,You promised no fire....right?
45,13,3,True, but you must admit emission control regulations have improved air quality.
40,2,5,Do we really have to keep dragon this on?
32,4,0,Nice bingo wings!
33,3,1,You didn't know that breathing fire is nowadays considered passe?
28,2,1,Okay, we'll do it your way but then I bite your head off.
40,12,2,What a time to have a flameout!
26,3,1,Face it, Puff. Honnah Lee ain't big enough for the both of us!
28,0,0,Next time I get to choose weapons Sir Knight!
76,34,16,I'm sorry I said you had small hands.
33,7,0,I hate it when my pilot light goes out!
27,2,0,To the victor, goes the Princess
31,1,0,No doubt about it... I've got to quit smolting....
38,8,1,Actually, I'm carbon-neutral
29,2,0,I'd be much obliged if you switched to your left arm.
28,1,0,I'm sorry to tell you, Louie, but I've got resumes out. Even your 'breathing smoke' gag no longer draws crowds.
32,4,0,Sinusitis will be the death of me!
25,0,0,Your epee is wimpy. En garde ... or you'll hear from my lawyers, Lunge and Perry.
35,3,1,You see, chivalry's not so hard, even with those tiny hands.
35,6,1,You never practiced with your left arm, did you?
35,9,0,Southpaws always gave Drago trouble.
38,2,3,Fair fight? My hands are Trump size!
39,10,1,Are you aware this is a non-smoking venue?
37,4,2,Now it's your turn to "Feel the Bern"!
27,0,0,Game of Thrones Season Seven -- John Snow's resurrection from retirement
40,5,2,Then why are you smiling?" "Because I know something you don't know." "And what is that?" "I... am not left-handed.
30,1,0,Okay, now if you could just make yourself smaller, and less like a dragon...
46,12,4,Puff the magic dragon was beginning to wonder if little Jackie Paper was as flammable as his name implied
46,17,3,With you facing tougher emission standards, this could be our last duel.
36,7,1,I really appreciate you doing this.
33,3,1,You have to believe in yourself.
44,9,3,Our kingdom has no room for a trumposaurus.
30,1,1,I suppose you want a bigger sword?
37,6,2,I could just incinerate you, you know!
33,6,1,The only weapon that will suffice, for a dragon with asthma...
27,1,0,Keep practicing and someday you'll be an intimidating adversary!
27,1,0,Drop it like its hot!
34,8,0,Mano a...?
48,12,4,Your shoe's untied.
27,0,0,In the name of Athleisure!
47,8,3,C'mon quit Draggin your feet!
28,0,0,How dare he. I've been waiting here all day -- and he shows up without a princess?

31,1,1,Give me your best shot, David!"
35,5,2,As soon as we finish the fencing lesson we'll move on to hot yoga. I think you will be a natural at that!
32,4,0,Hmm, the old arms race.
41,10,3,Take that you mere myth and future plastic toy!
30,3,0,How about a rap battle?
34,10,0,Let's make this good, Fafnir. Someday operas will be written about this.
29,2,0,Not so tough now, are you, Geoffrey?
29,2,0,How about I use my right hand and you use your left?
40,10,3,I don't see where this class will help me in the real world.

33,3,1,Nice work! So how long have you been doing political ads?
29,3,0,I'd heard the rumors about Russian athletes taking performance-enhancing substances, but I thought fencing would be clean.
30,2,0,You're farsighted. It's a lion.
40,9,2,Careful, there are grass fire restrictions for this whole county!
61,32,7,Thanks for helping me impress the princess. I owe you one.
31,3,0,You know where you can blow that smoke, you green schmuck!
31,5,0,I'm sure glad they banned open flames in this kingdom!
29,2,0,Is it okay to fight when you have garlic breath?
60,11,11,Biodiversity my ass...you're going down!
30,3,0,Political correctness, affirmative action, I don't care what you call it. It works for me.
37,7,1,Dragon slaying is just a job. But designing fashionable dragon-slaying under armor is my passion.
36,6,1,Don't be so steamed. You got to choose weapons last time.
38,9,1,I'll stop the personal attacks when you actually stop smoking.
29,2,0,I thought that Clyde 'The Dragon' Robinson was just a nickname...
32,5,1,I bet you can't look between your legs.
39,7,3,But you'll support me in the general, right?
35,3,2,You wanted to join the EU, so you have to play by the rules
33,8,2,Sure, you've got short arms, but I'm actually right handed.
27,1,0,The noble rules clearly state that the use of fire shall be strictly prohibited during a sword fight.
32,4,0,You are in a smoke free zone
43,14,2,Lighten up -- once the drought ends I'm sure they'll lift the fire-breathing ban.
37,10,1,Next is pens!
31,2,1,Never leave your wing-man!
35,1,2,Parry left. Didn't know I was ambidextrous, did you.
28,5,0,Maybe a nicotine patch would help you stop smoking.
33,2,1,I thought these vorpal blades were supposed to work snicker-snack.
40,10,2,I thought you had stopped smoking.
25,2,0,Take that!
29,2,0,Touché!
29,3,0,I meant the computer dragon!
33,5,1,Sorry, HBO cut our fire budget.

34,2,1,Say your prayers Dragon, I'm an accomplished switch slayer.
54,16,7,Okay, she's watching now. Make your death look realistic.
33,1,1,Allow me to humor you before this smoke turns into fire to cook my dinner.
34,6,1,I really shouldn't have to go through all this; I already have enough super delegates to win.
38,5,2,The tale of Tim the Eager, St. George's second cousin, is sadly forgotten.
24,0,0,This sword fight seems to be draggin'. Did you see what I did there?
32,3,1,It’s plastic swords till you’re 18. Then it’s guns.
31,1,1,Me St. George. You dragon. You give up.
34,5,1,Ok, now you say, 'Dragon who'?
38,4,3,Your breath smells like kerosine.
27,1,0,You're really right-handed?
32,3,0,Remember, I had the choice of weapons.
45,10,4,No wonder we're extinct.....Damn these short arms!
44,9,2,I admire your rapid adaptation!
37,8,1,Yes, I promise this will help build upper body strength
35,3,1,The Mother of Dragons sent me. I am a life coach.
36,7,1,Just remember, no breathing fire or flying!!
34,7,0,THE TUMS I SLIPPED INTO HIS LAST KILL SEEM TO BE WORKING

30,3,1,Admit it, on some level you are having fun.
33,3,0,Fighting this migraine is like gorilla warfare
28,0,0,ARRR, he didn't tell me he was a lefty.
35,5,1,Draconian measures may not be in the public interest...
41,13,2,It’s a win-win: I get the damsel and later you get to incinerate the village. All you have to do is play dead for a short while.
29,3,0,Let's keep this fight even, shall we!
43,11,4,Two out of three?
33,2,1,Let's pretend: I'm the Ninja Hillary and you're the Evil Trump.
32,5,0,"Not such a flaming badass in hand-to-flipper combat, eh, skippy?
29,3,0,Fire breathing at hundred paces we will see how evenly matched we are then.
42,12,3,Funny, I never picked you for a swordsman.
28,0,0,Turns out HR asked me to complete a MonkeySurvey, not a SurveyMonkey.
36,8,1,Why not just incinerate me? Well because you don't want to labeled a one trick dragon now do you?
40,8,2,Now it's fair!
36,2,3,Can we get this dual over with? It's really starting to drag-on.
32,6,0,Next time I'll let YOU choose weapons.
30,3,0,That's my family crest!
42,0,0,This is why Disney hates dragons... Come up another princess story that involve killing dragons.
35,4,1,Let's keep it friendly. I don't want to kill my mother-in-law.
28,2,0,Bring it on Jackie Paper!
36,2,2,Your challenge, my choice of weapons, T-Rex arms.
29,3,0,God bless the queen's ban on firearms.
37,7,1,You're lucky there's a burn ban in effect, Sir John.
46,10,4,Aren't our duels more interesting since they banned greenhouse gases?
30,2,0,Your choice of protective armor seems to have come up short.
44,6,4,Quit calling me 'Little Jackie Paper.'
31,1,1,If you insist on smoking this will be your last swordplay lesson, comprendi?
47,16,4,If it makes you feel better, win or lose, we both get a trophy.
32,6,0,This is how the Dinosword became extinct.
32,10,1,Jim, eat a Snickers. You're not yourself when you're hungry.

33,3,0,IF YOUR SWORD DOESN'T KILL YOU BREATH WILL.
34,2,1,Can you sing? We could make big bucks doing Wagner at the Met.

32,1,1,Fool--you think the right and the left is finally on equal terms?!
29,2,0,What sort of dragon fights right-handed?
26,1,0,I hate battles in a No Smoking Zone
29,0,0,We're just like Brienne and the Hound
35,6,1,You really need to do something about that bad breath.
28,1,0,Sorry, I thought I had my phone on vibrate
42,10,2,You are in trouble. I binged watched Game of Thrones.
28,2,0,...and after this there will be "feats of strength". A true Festivus miracle.
73,25,14,I meant filthy stinking beast in the intellectual sense.
44,2,2,I said ANY reproduction of my image without express written consent is prohibited!
32,3,1,Hey, you challenged me. I choose the weapons.
32,4,0,That guy I ate strategically downed three bottles of Tums? Touche, crusader, touche.
32,4,0,Isn't somehow odd that I, a dragon, am a better swordsman than you are?
35,4,1,Game of Thrones perpetuates unrealistic expectations of us dragons.
31,0,1,Before man had dog, man had dragon.
37,7,2,How about we stop fighting and go frolic in the autumn mist in Honnah Lee instead?
39,10,1,No value in fuming about the rules.
51,13,7,I never knew how real fighting your imaginary demons could be.
29,2,0,Have you ever thought about flossing?
71,28,14,Your technique is good but I'm not sensing any fire in the belly.

32,5,0,Don't forget; you agreed to Marquess of Queensberry Rules.
51,11,6,How long will this drag-on?
28,0,0,The Powerful Fire Breathing World Powers battling ISIS ... and getting fed up ...
29,3,0,How do you like me now?
29,2,0,Again, thanks for tipping the 'scales' in my favor.
37,4,2,I must warn you, I’m binge-watching Game of Thrones.
32,6,0,If we work together, we could make shish kebob.
36,0,3,I will vanquish you like Lyin' Ted and Low Energy Jeb.

30,2,0,This what its like taking every english test.
48,12,4,May I suggest a short break for breath-mints?
45,14,4,Okay, I'll take back what I said about 'small hands'.
47,9,4,... and when I yell, BEWARE, DRAGON! I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS LAND GREAT AGAIN! that's when you pretend to be impressed.
29,1,0,I don't have time for these games
35,3,1,There's so little smoke that I'm not afraid of your fire!
31,4,0,I know you're steamed about the no-smoking laws.
34,3,1,Don't be late. We can't start the barbecue without you.
30,2,0,Have me medium rare, garnished with desert brush and sprigs.
53,12,9,I thought you said you were going to stop smoking
29,1,0,You are so not my Mother!

31,4,2,Fight like a triceratops.
32,4,1,My kingdom did not cause hay fever just to annoy you.
46,11,4,Ahh, no wonder you're extinct
34,4,1,By George, let's do it.
28,0,0,Fighting princes doesn't pay enough... I just want to dance. I'll show them all!
31,4,0,This guy really burns me.
42,9,2,Quit all the huffin and puffin. This is not personal.
56,24,7,Try making an effort, will you? No wonder you're practically extinct.
33,5,1,HBO ordered another season....so pardon my cockiness
43,4,0,What, not fire? Your choice of weapons speaks volumes, old chap.
38,7,2,Only after seeing the dragon's smoke did Sir Lance realize he left the porridge on the stove.
33,4,1,I should have skipped the swimming class today.
30,2,0,Let's just play mumbley peg.
31,2,1,Fine. I'll fight you with a sword for now but if I sneeze, you are barbeque.
32,2,1,Ready...on three, switch arms.
40,12,2,Don't waste your breath.
30,2,0,Talk about casting against type!
34,5,0,Come on! Let's see some fire in your belly.
68,28,14,These things tend to dragon.
29,1,0,Seems a bit unfair, this height advantage of yours.
39,6,3,It's lefty,whats yours?
36,10,1,Do I look fat in this chainmail ?
29,1,0,So because the King banned smoking, I don't get to choose my own weapon?!
33,6,0,Not so tough in a fair fight, are you?
31,3,0,Aren't you supposed to be at the studio next door for the PBS Special?
34,4,1,This whole leveling the playing field has gone too far.
39,10,1,how do you think I feel? I'm right-handed!
26,1,0,Face it, my armor really is fireproof.
32,2,1,The dragon slayer met his match in a dragon that was also a dragon slayer slayer.
30,2,0,I fight for your right to live Dragon. The sign means what it says- No Smoking.
29,5,0,I never should have said, "Choose your weapon."
49,14,5,I have a shot at this if he doesn't sneeze...
33,9,0,I don't know which one of us looks sillier.
56,20,8,Oh sorry, I guess you can't put one arm behind your back
30,3,0,If you're looking for a rules change, you won't get one here.
34,6,0,You lost at rock-paper-scissors, so man up!
50,5,7,No really, Puff is a very strong name !
33,5,0,Your huffin and puffin a bit more than usual.
50,17,5,You know you could just eat me, right?
32,2,1,No smoking please, the audience is not going to stand for that
36,6,1,You have excellent form. May I ask, Harvard or Yale?
36,1,2,Fair play, Shmair play. This sucks!
25,0,0,All I learned in knight training was stop, drop and roll!
28,1,0,I am Gandor, scripted World Dragon Federation Ultimate Warrior.
52,11,7,I warned you never to call me "PUFF".
31,5,0,I never said you were a dinosaur.
32,2,1,Now it's my turn to be Hamlet, and for once you can be Laertes.
44,11,2,We'll make a fortune from Pay-Per-View.
27,1,1,I give up, what have you learnt to do?
27,0,0,"My lord, I thinketh I have spied a mouse in thine dungeon," she speaketh. Wenches! Sheesheth!
34,5,1,I meant it as a compliment--where I come from, everyone has one arm shorter than the other!
40,13,1,Yeah, and your breath ain't so hot either.
31,6,0,This is boring. Let's go back to painted wings and giant strings.
37,8,1,When my people get on the Rules Committee, it will be a different story!
43,11,2,Smoking is gonna kill you, Dragon.
28,3,0,Quit dragon your feet and fight me dangit!
29,2,0,You have a thumb, I can't breathe fire.
27,0,0,Try not to spoil anything—I haven't gotten to this episode yet.

36,5,1,Are you mocking me?
37,6,2,At your house, we can play with your toys.
30,1,0,Boy, you have really bad breath!
40,6,1,Since I have to use my left hand, then you do too!
35,6,1,Scissors!
29,2,0,Although he still hated the knights, Puff had lost his "fire in the belly" for a fight.
27,0,0,Ugh! I thought I ordered this hero well-done, NOT rare.
35,10,0,It's just nice to get out of the house, you know?
33,3,0,Can you and Khaleesi do dinner Wednesday?
30,2,0,Everyone is unique in their own ways, but we have all learned the same war.

29,1,1,Humanize me, never !
33,3,1,I didn't know she is your girl friend.
28,0,0,They said they were from Survey Monkey.
46,7,5,Promise if I win, you'll give up smoking!
29,3,0,Oh calm down, I just want a DNA sample.
35,3,2,So I guess, fire breathing was an urban legend.
35,5,2,O, treach’rous villain! Thee falsely boasteth in thy Airbnb listing thy lair possesses "absolute privacy and seclusion."
59,13,10,Merrily, Sir Galahad continued in gallant swordplay despite a vague, but growing suspicion that his opponent was somehow holding back…
34,4,1,You are toast, my lord!
26,2,0,What gas b ill?
33,4,1,Some upper-body workouts might help.
37,6,2,His patience wearing thin, Puff felt increasingly unfriendly toward Lord Marshmallow.
32,1,1,Yes ! My point ! I'm winning !
28,1,0,Humph! I bet this guy thinks that because he has a shield, and I don't, he has the advantage. One hot dog coming up!
31,5,1,This is what happens when dragons grow up without fathers.
30,3,0,If I can't use my bad breath, then you can't either!
31,6,0,This is much better for the environment than belching a lot of fire and smoke!
30,1,0," Your arms are Dragon you down".
29,3,0,Hope I don't need the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.
40,7,2,My quest, my weapons....pea brain.
26,2,0,Damn,you won the coin toss.
50,8,6,Puff immediately regretted taking the whole bottle of antacid.
32,2,1,Alas for the olden days when a dragon could really roast an enemy. Thaniks, Obama.
33,3,2,This IS my warrior one yoga pose.
31,3,0,Yes, I represent the anti-smoking tobacco industry.
30,1,0,Similarly descibed, yet no match either!
40,6,3,With your fire out Daenerys asked me to work on your other skills.
32,4,0,You wouldn't hit a dragon with a cold, would you?
31,5,0,Winner gets to be a superdelegate!
27,0,0,You're not the Brother of Dragons, and you're definitely not Jon Snow.
35,7,0,Those new air pollution regulations have made these contests more even.
32,8,0,I come to cut your greenhouse gas emissions
29,1,0,Go with the left if you want, I'm sticking with the right.
34,4,1,You're still the favorite in the swimsuit competition.
34,7,1,I hate the new safety regulations too.
36,5,2,Have you ever heard of David and Goliath?
49,11,6,Need a breath mint?
32,4,1,I'm only doing this for a book deal.
31,1,0,Ha, Ha, this is like fighting fire with fire!
48,13,5,Winner, winner, pterodactyl dinner.
35,3,2,...But Sire , you chose the weapons !
29,2,0,Do you feel lucky, punk?
31,4,0,These fantasy camps really make you feel like the real thing!
29,2,0,I must seek release from my vegan-vows!
49,6,7,Prepare yourself to become extinct, Sir!
34,9,0,"We're going to need bigger swords".
41,11,2,Hey, I'm not the one in charge of regulating carbon emissions.
29,2,0,This is what happens when you don't pay your bill.
30,4,0,Good thing you're pyrophobic!
33,0,2,It's not fiar, I have a big head and tiny arms.
32,2,1,Adaptation is futile. Extinction rules.
34,3,1,I’ll build a wall around you so great it’ll be fire-resistant… Obviously Mexico will pay for it
43,11,2,Just think of it as a step in the fight against global warming.
31,2,1,Huh, so this is how the other half shivs?
35,1,2,But seriously I really am the nephew of all dragons!
32,2,1,You should know that I'm pretty terrific at everything I do, and maybe dragons don't actually live forever.
41,8,3,You do realize that there is a no smoking sign right behind you.
31,2,1,Trust the farce.
56,17,8,Sorry, but the castle grounds are now all smoke free.
28,2,0,What do you mean, you don't think the carbon tax was a good idea?
29,2,0,You fight like someone with small hands.
30,2,0,You're done, Big Guy
28,2,0,Dragon: Why even give me a sword in the first place? Knight: CHIVALRY ISN'T DEAD!!!
29,2,0,Can't believe Home Depot is out of butane AGAIN
28,3,0,You do realize you can smoke me out with one breath, right?
30,2,0,This is what I get for asking the pharmacist to supersize my throat lozenge.
29,2,0,You lucky I just took my antacid
27,2,0,Die you Super-delegate! Die!
39,11,0,You challenged, and I chose the weapons. So stop kvetching.
32,5,0,Who says chivalry is dead?
33,1,1,You knew what I meant when I said "fire with fire."
27,1,0,Are you sure you closed the window.?
31,2,0,You think they give out Best Little Knight awards to just any kid in the kingdom?
32,1,1,That's it! First we cross swords and then you switch hands so it's lefty against lefty.
40,8,3,We could avoid all this conflict if you just pop a breath mint!
29,2,0,Ok- winner gets pay per view rights.
29,3,0,I see you've been keeping your skill set up to date.
30,2,0,Looks like someone didn't read the fine print.
32,2,1,I ask for a Tyrosonarous Rex and I get a Rex from Tyrosonarous
35,6,1,Hold up--that's my mobile.
28,0,0,Slay the dragon! I thought that meant I had to date his ugly sister.
45,5,6,Yeah, this reminds me of the 2016 presidential debate as well.
46,12,2,Really, you need to work on your footwork.
34,8,0,You'll just have to do the best you can. It's not MY fault you took a Tums.
31,2,1,See, didn't I tell you? Fair is fun!
45,10,4,Not one to be easily typecast, Puff auditions for the role of knight #2.
32,2,1,Memo to self: Remember to buy some flint from Lair Depot.
39,8,2,"Try putting your back into it".
36,1,2,My choice of weapons does seem unfair but I'm only using one arm.
31,3,0,You're a one-ton dragon who breathes fire—why the sword?
40,8,2,"How many times do I have to tell you...it's parry first, then lunge.".
49,17,5,Why do I get the feeling you're holding something back?
28,2,0,Yes, smart guy, I know this is my fantasy. Now if you'd just let me slay you, I wouldn't have to waste money on more of these %#%*. workshops!
44,10,4,You're going to need a shield if this is going to be a fair fight.
34,6,1,When in Rome, fight as the Romans fight.
31,4,0,Remember! No ear-biting!!!
28,1,0,Right it's hard to bring a mythological story to the screen but this is actually doing us more harm then good.
28,1,0,The day shish kabob was invented.
38,8,3,Good, that's a little more fierce looking. A bet's a bet and I told you my kids are watching.
29,3,0,Nothing personal, I'm up for Duke.
31,3,0,If you kill me, you don´t get the shield!
39,12,2,Your mother's a garter snake!
34,1,2,The new rules of battle forbid biting and the breathing of fire and require the use of similar weaponry between adversaries.
34,3,0,nobody tells me where I can smoke
45,7,5,Your smoke is mightier than your sword.
29,2,0,This is the dream I always wanted
28,2,0,we might have ordered from the wrong amazon
30,1,1,This is the last time I 'walk a mile in your riding boots.'
27,0,0,You sunk my battleship!
32,4,0,Time for your last best word Trumposaurus!
27,1,0,It will take more than an opposable thumb to defeat Vlad the Impaler!
29,2,0,And furthermore, thy dam wast uglier than thou by a long shot.
39,10,1,We can call it a day if you need to catch your breath.
38,6,2,An historical rendering of the infamous battle between the fearless Righty Knighty and the fierce Lefty Lucy.
30,3,0,By George, he's got it!
84,29,12,Agreed - you won't breathe fire and I won't make any jokes about your ludicrously small baby hands
33,4,0,This is what we call medieval democratic socialism.
39,14,4,Now isn't this fairer?
34,7,0,When we are done with your lesson you're teaching me to breath fire, right?
43,14,3,Take it out on the Surgeon General, not me.
42,11,2,It's not my fault you let your pilot light go out.
35,9,0,Et tu, Brute?
31,0,1,And after this is a game of Old Maid and then your favorite....Dragons and Dungeons.
41,6,2,Thank God for the Geneva Conventions.
57,16,9,"Nessie--I am your father.
55,9,1,I slay you this time and you breath fire on me next time.
36,6,1,Ha! Run out of firepower I see!
29,1,0,This is the last time I left you choose weapons.

38,10,1,You have a point-but no smoking means no smoking. Just use the sword, and make the best of it.
35,4,2,I'M HOT HEADED?
29,2,0,Honest, I thought you were Sleeping Beauty.
30,4,0,I don't see how I can lose this fight.
36,10,0,Smoking should have stunted your growth.

48,12,5,OK, I take it back. You don't have silly little arms.
38,5,2,Don't get huffy, I'm a superdelegate!
26,0,0,I shall SLAY you!!!!
34,10,0,That's right, my name's George. What's it to ya?
30,4,0,Fight like a man, you reptilian rapscallion!

32,2,1,Hey little man, the only way I could have a unfair advantage is if you ingested a truckload of TicTacs.
29,1,0,Fine little knight. I will use a puny sword for our battle but you are NOT sharing a bathroom with me.
29,3,0,What did you say about my small hands?
28,0,0,Mama Daenerys also said that after playtime you have to brush your teeth and wash your face.
29,2,0,Say it right! It's pronounced "sord", the 'w' is silent!
36,2,3,You haven't watched the swordsman scene in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," have you?
30,8,0,"I'd like to see a little more lunge in your "On Guard".

46,12,5,You know, smoking will kill you.
28,1,0,You are about to see my swipe right on the white guy move
37,9,1,Thank you for posing in my family crest
43,11,3,Get angry! Get that fire in the belly!
41,5,3,Next time I pick the dueling weapons!
48,15,5,Looks like Puff is having a rough knight.
30,2,0,Don't look at me...it was your turn to pay the gas bill....
48,13,5,Between you and me, I've been feeling a little burnt out myself lately.
28,1,0,I realize it's too lat, but I thought you might appreciate my idea fir last week's contest: "I don't think you should order an more Aps for your phone until your typing improves."
35,3,2,This is why you win in the regular season - home field advantage means swords, not fire.
53,22,5,Yeah, well I'm not really left handed either.
35,9,0,Sir Loin's last words: "I say, noble dragon, what's the dilly with your left arm?"
37,9,2,With all this hot air and swordplay, you'd think we were running for president.
37,9,1,Roleplay remember, roleplay. Come on!!!
30,1,0,I wish the screenwriter would just let me smoke you.
36,7,1,Stop complaining... Proper swordsmanship will come in handy when you've lost that fire in your belly.
38,8,1,What a waste of an opposable thumb!
36,7,1,These are swords, mate. Welcome to the 12th century!
34,2,1,Just like I said, eventually the shale oil play was going to dry up.
46,21,1,One day we'll both look back on this and laugh.
41,11,2,Are you still steaming because you lost our arm wrestling match?
32,4,0,Mine isn't a sword, it's for fire-breathing knight kabob.
32,4,0,I hate it when these duels keep draggin' on.
31,5,0,Please don't be offended if I recommend you plan for extinction.
33,3,1,A Flame Out! Oh No! Not Again!
56,19,5,No, no....It's parry, parry, thrust. Do it again, and don't get all steamed up this time.
31,2,1,Fine. I'll put the fire away, but if he thinks we're both getting trophies after this, he's got another thing coming.
28,0,0,I thought we were going to do this with switchblades!
41,9,4,We should think about how society forced us into these roles.
38,5,4,You realize that you are toast any time I choose.
33,2,1,I didn't mean to wake you
44,14,2,In time, we'll both be extinct.
30,3,0,Strings and paper again? Die Jackie!
27,1,0,Guess dragons played with their food, too.
31,3,0,Our next stop is Vegas, so lighten up Dude!
56,15,10,Puff all you want. The song was about smoking pot... not you.
42,14,1,Take it up with the Union, Firebreath. They agreed with these rules.
45,17,2,If I win, you entertain at my son's birthday party.
36,6,1,Do you mind if I use a slingshot instead?
29,2,0,Mithmatch.
38,3,3,Fire, and it'll be all over social media in a minute.
45,12,3,The smoke is a great effect, but if you add some fire we'll get millions of views.
41,9,2,Parry and thrust is ok, but absolutely no belching.
33,3,1,If you could just stop losing your own swords...
43,16,2,Come on already. Fight like a man!
35,3,1,Thank God for King's new outdoor combat fire regulations!
29,0,1,You may have my sword but I have your arm length.
28,1,0,I can't wait to finish my PhD. in psychology, so I can quit being a knife sharpener.
30,3,0,When you don't use your fire, our fights tend to drag on.
44,11,3,I, for one, think it's wonderful that you've given up smoking.
33,6,1,I declare, however foul the sulfurous belching, thy small hands doom thee.
44,10,3,You've been smoking again ?!?
33,5,0,As the duel wore on, Dragon realized that his weapon selection lacked foresight.
31,4,0,Queensberry rules, okay?
43,2,1,Jeez .. Gave up Jurassic Park for this ??
30,1,0,Now look at the pony. Good!
35,8,1,I'm one Danish you won't get for breakfast today, Grendel!
35,5,1,Puff, make our fight look real. I want to impress the maiden watching us.
34,4,0,This is a great way to work out your arms.
20,1,0,You Brits don't listen, I said I turned vegetarian!
47,17,4,Don't blame me -- this is the way George R.R. Martin wrote it.
27,0,1,En garde, hellspawn!
65,17,12,Moments later, Trogdor tired of swordplay and simply ate Steve.
48,12,6,I'm fine--it's a dry heat.
32,4,0,Have you considered switching to e-cigarettes?
29,1,0,Goliath, what big teeth you have!
22,2,1,I don't suppose a belly rub would help?
44,8,4,Because your arm isn't long enough to take a selfie.
35,6,1,Stop fuming, we'll play dungeons and dragons tomorrow
38,5,2,Once again I'll explain: we are using swords because of a fire ordinance.
43,12,3,If you haven’t heard, now there’s also a No Biting rule.
44,7,4,I hate these new government regulations!
29,3,0,Better!... Good job... now close your eyes and use "the Force".
32,1,1,Its swords until you do something about that gunpowder breath
37,7,3,What stance? The elastic on my tights is shot.

35,4,2,I'll show you who's bathroom you can't use.
32,4,1,I sense you are ready to fire your primary weapon.
41,11,2,STOP COMPLAINING, IT WAS A FAIR COIN TOSS.
59,22,7,See, right there! You did it again! You're bending your elbow.
30,4,0,That's a bit of overkill isn't it?
35,7,1,When a casual Altoid offer is misconstrued.
29,2,0,Why must we always play by his rules?
32,5,0,With an attitude like that, how do you expect to make it to the Olympics?
28,0,1,Et tu, Mother of Dragons
37,7,2,OK, yeah, the television series took some liberties.
22,2,0,Where's Goliath when you need him?
48,13,4,You really should give up smoking.
40,5,3,Dragon? I thought they said my opponent would be draggin'.
34,6,0,We all have bad breath from time to time; there's no dishonor in it.
34,3,1,Give yourself to the Dark Side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you.
28,2,0,Sure, you can do it with the right arm...
33,3,1,What's a matter, forgot your Fiagra?
46,13,4,Dangerous, maybe. But, they say the second-hand smoke will get me first.
34,5,1,But it's much more fun to play with your food than eat it!
32,3,1,Danny, you're not you when you're hungry.
53,17,5,You do know that smoking could kill you?
26,0,0,The outsourcing of fire production to human companies took its toll on the dragon's job prospects.

30,2,0,This is your last battle "Lefty.
28,0,0,Sorry dear, I didn't take the cleaning company's name "Monkey Shines" literally.
40,16,4,Darn it, we forgot the marshmallows again.
35,5,1,Maybe a little spark will relight your fire.
41,16,1,Can we just go back to thumb wrestling?
30,1,1,There will be no 'second debate'
36,8,1,Get to the point. Damsels await.
35,4,0,Have you heard the one about David and Goliath? George and the Dragon?
35,3,2,Swords only, no fire.
39,5,1,You should be in Colorado
45,16,3,Because this will look great on my resume, that's why!
41,7,3,I can see you were lying about being left handed
34,7,1,First, the rules, no fire extinguishers!
29,3,0,Why do I always have to play by his rules
29,1,0,I should have just stayed with the prince.

34,6,1,Until you regain fire breathing capabilities, this a skill you need to master.
44,6,4,Aha Puff, it appears you've lost your magic.
31,1,1,I told you, George, there's no need to fight. I'm a vegan now.
42,10,2,When you advertised for a fencer, I thought you were a rancher.
35,3,2,Someday Joseph Campbell will write of this--win or lose.
46,13,5,It's the second hand smoke that will kill me.
28,1,0,That tiny left arm is freaking me out. What are you, half T-rex? Hello! Distracting!

34,6,1,Your short arms are no match for mine
41,12,1,Whoever said 'The Pen is Mightier than the sword' never read Grendel.
33,3,1,I see your schwartz is as big as mine.
38,9,1,First rule of Sword Fight Club is nobody talks about Sword Fight Club. The second rule is no fire-breathing. Sorry dude.
36,6,1,It's not the length of the sword that counts, rather the zest with which you wield it.
44,7,4,Caution Sir Knight: Second hand smoke may be harmful to your health.
31,5,0,I don't think there's any good ending to this.

44,12,3,What's the matter? Feeling hydrated?
34,4,1,I'll see your 'en garde!' and raise you a touche!

31,6,0,Can we try negotiating one more time?
31,4,0,A thrust to your parry, I slay thee.
33,3,1,Uhh... 'Hodor'?!
34,5,0,You need to bend your front leg as you thrust, otherwise those little arms will never do any damage.

38,7,3,My hands are not small!
46,9,5,I hate to tell you this, but I'm not really left-handed.

39,10,1,I'm not left-handed either.
46,10,7,If I hear that Peter Paul and Mary song one more time I will have to kill you.
27,2,0,maybe i do need to get a life.
28,1,0,Ok. Maybe my shield is small, but your other arm is puny too.
30,3,0,Inter-species symmetrical warfare is so refreshing!
30,2,0,The next time my Manager agrees to a "no fire" fight he gets fired.

27,0,0,You slay me, big one!
50,8,7,For a fire-breathing dragon, you have very small hands.
46,12,4,And this is for contributing to global warming!
35,5,1,Thank you for smoking.
45,13,3,You could get a lot more power out of your swing if you adjusted your grip.

35,3,1,Aw..w..w. Look who got out of the wrong side of bed this morning !
30,3,0,With footwork like that you'll never make the All Honalee team.
42,13,1,George was thankful for Dragons' renowned sense of fair-play.
39,8,2,Don't even think about it! Fire danger is "high" today.
74,34,14,It's parry and thrust, not parry, thrust and singe. There is NO singe. Now, once again....
60,21,9,In the original script, I think you were supposed to be a windmill.
39,10,1,You agreed to the rules. Deal with it.
25,1,0,Don't even think of it. I'm wearing SPF9000 flame protection.
30,2,0,Love the knight tattoo on the outsize arm.
29,3,0,The Knight 's choice of weapons gets two thumbs up.
43,4,4,We've made an "X". That means love.

37,5,2,Don't patronize me
36,8,1,I hear ya, but even here at Game Of Thrones Fantasy Camp, there are just a limited number of roles you can play.
44,5,5,Sorry about the drought regulations.
35,6,1,This seems like a much more civilized way to decide which of us will be our parties nominee

37,6,2,Kudos to you for being chivalrous.
27,2,0,I really thought Game of Thrones was going to phone back this time!
41,15,1,Fire breathing is a marketable skill, but you don't want to be a one trick dragon.
42,13,3,I usually fight fire with fire.
37,4,2,How appropriate... you wield your sword like a fire breathing dragon!
32,1,0,First the mountains. Next our swords. Now you must be scaled!
35,6,1,Live and let live? What would mythology say of me?
45,16,3,Don't you know it's not nice to play with your food.
41,9,3,No fair! Stop breathing on me.

41,9,1,Stop fuming! You'll get the hang of it soon.
76,26,9,you might feel a little prick.
27,2,0,Who are you, Lizard Face? You don't scare me. Ooh, fancy wings. I'll kick your butt. I'll prove I'm not just a bunch of hot air.
46,12,5,Well, I couldn't figure out how to fight fire with fire...
39,10,1,Nothing like small arms practice, eh?
67,31,10,It appears that my arms reduction strategy is working!
41,7,3,Stop complaining. I don't make the rules.
33,5,0,None of that, barbecue breath! Fight fair!
29,3,0,Your next lesson will be on controlling your anger.
35,5,2,So—given the disparity of our sizes and your apparent anger and the potential of the harm that may happen to me, let’s call the whole thing off.
32,2,1,Wings and sword but no fire, I feel defeated already

41,1,5,You've been tampering with your Smaug-control device again, haven't you?
30,3,0,If you stop calling me Kingslayer, I'll stop calling you Puff, okay?
48,14,5,Gotcha! Your pilot-light just went out.
36,7,1,Stupid fire safety code...
35,4,1,When I say "time out" it means one of my toes is starting to cramp.
31,2,0,I swear, Beast! Thine cuckold's horns art not because of me!
29,4,0,If you want to be on TV, you'll have to learn to sing too.
30,3,0,Now you're mad, but you're the one who chose the weapon.
45,14,3,Flambe! Er, I mean, En garde!
42,10,3,Wait, you didn't say "En Garde!".
25,2,0,I still say the 14th Amendment does not apply here.
32,2,1,Unless you want me to call the EEOC, keep fighting this way.
37,5,2,Dragons live forever, but not so little boys...
35,10,0,I dislike our new union regulations
33,4,1,This Jackie Paper turned out to be a real brat!
31,3,0,Some of my best friends are Targaryen.

29,3,0,Me David, you Goliath.
40,12,2,Flameout!! Now I gotcha.
32,2,1,Now, Drogon, isn't this more fun than frying someone with a ball of fire?

29,2,0,Let me guess, your friends call you "David", right ?
34,8,0,Saint George was awarded the Bronze medal in the first Olympic fencing match
26,0,0,"I hate Kevlar".
69,31,11,Not so fearsome with your pilot light out, are you?
33,1,1,Sorry, but it just slipped out in the heat of battle. I actually think you have a lot of important things to say.
38,6,1,Oh come on, at least look like you're trying.
33,3,1,Make it look real, my trusted wingman, she's in distress.
41,9,2,'This feels like a Monty Python skit.'
61,25,9,Funny - I thought your sword would be bigger.
42,9,3,Hm... And they told me knights exist only in fairy tales.
47,8,5,You know it's because I can't fight fire with fire.
28,0,0,Dude, the T-Rex died out like 2 million years ago.
29,0,1,I may be honorable, but I am one stupid dragon.

36,6,1,There's no way I was trying to hit on your sister!
42,10,3,Thank you for not contributing to global warming.
37,5,1,But the scouting report had you listed as a right-hander.
33,3,2,It wouldn't have come down to this if my pilot light hadn't gone out.
32,4,0,Let's call it a draw this time.
41,11,2,Because you never pick up the check.
34,8,0,See? THIS is how good it feels to fight fairly!
31,8,0,This would make a great tattoo.
34,0,2,On guard, dragon. I'm just get gettin' fired-up!
39,10,1,You think you're hot stuff.
56,25,5,I didn't say do you want a match, I said do you have a match?
64,14,11,Oh yeah? Well, your momma is so old she looks like a T. rex!
32,3,1,Any history of mental illness in your family Mr. Gandalf?
43,9,3,You're playing with fire!

32,3,1,You challenged , so I got to choose. Quit your fuming, whiner.
28,1,0,The only reason I'm playing with you chump is that there's nothing on the tube.
58,18,8,I'm going to help you quit smoking, even if it kills me!
33,4,0,Would this vassal be included on the South Breach Diet Plan?
41,2,0,Sorry Hillary, you're just not firey enough.

31,0,1,You have my word. I'll return your eggs when we finish posing for my tapestry.

51,11,7,I'll bet you taste like chicken.
44,6,5,Impressive, but can you take a selfie?
42,11,3,You need more work on your parry before we move on to thrust.
37,4,2,No you can not have one last smoke!
32,2,1,What do you mean "Dragon lives matter?"
29,0,1,The Comprehensive Agreement clearly bans Exhalations of Mass Destruction. If you incinerate me, this place will ne crawling with UN inspectors in 30 days, 90 days tops. Is that really what you want?
28,0,0,he's better than me...
40,11,1,A southpaw?! Dammit!
30,3,0,Now don't pout, old chap. You know very well the new Rules of Engagement state that fire-breathing constitutes unfair advantage.
45,11,4,Doesn't seem fair that you also have opposable thumbs
35,2,2,And what's more, the Human Rights Commissioner says you so much as breathe on me and we're both toast.
37,8,1,Not so brave without your flames, are ya?
32,4,0,Stop whining, flame-retardant. Now duel!
41,11,2,I won th coin toss, and I chose swords. Get over it.
32,4,0,You must think I used up all my flames on the internet.
30,3,0,By George, you really burn me up.

37,6,2,You talk big, but your hands are really small!
28,2,0,Let me pass beast! I wish to use your bathroom!
39,7,2,Ever thought of running for president?

37,5,2,... But I identify as a princess.
37,7,1,The Bernie-Trump debate.

42,13,3,I'm so glad that we signed that ceasefire.
43,6,3,By now we both know the outcome. Don't you think it's time to quit this charade?
29,3,0,Rules are rules. This is a no-smoking environment. I win.
30,4,0,Anything with a sword and a dragon is cool––when you're 14.
29,2,0,When you use the word "fair" to describe her, why do I have this creepy feeling you mean fair-to-average?
35,4,1,This doesn’t feel like ‘Game of Thrones.’
35,9,0,Whatever you do, DON'T SNEEZE.
39,11,1,Really? You actually thought I was going to pick fire as my weapon of choice?
35,2,2,This is your last chance for mediation before I get angry!
25,10,1,Puff, you're supposed to hold it in.
46,20,2,Actually, on second thoughts, this town is big enough for both of us.
28,2,0,I thought this penis helmet would intimidate you, since your hands are so small.
34,3,1,I gave up smoking for this?
31,3,0,I know, I know...if I didn't steal your Tabasco, I'd be toast by know!
35,4,1,I can't be the only one parrying.
29,2,0,Touché, Saint George, you left-handed crusader.
34,1,2,Hillary and Trump discuss non-proliferation.
43,7,4,What's with those little fingers?
39,10,2,And lift! And thrust! And parry! And block! And again!
38,6,2,All I'm saying is, if you have a problem with the carbon tax, raise it at the next town hall meeting. next town hall meeting.
27,0,0,Don't worry, you only need the sword to survive.
39,7,1,Fine, but only becaues it's your birthday.
36,4,2,Event Number Four: Medieval Decathlon
35,3,2,I said "thrust," not "parry!" Let's think of another weapon you might be able to use.
25,0,0,Got GoT?
30,6,0,Of course the challenged party gets choice of weapons. Everybody knows that!
27,1,0,I was only trying to start your pilot light.
28,0,0,First you'll fume, then you'll pick up your sword and go home.
26,2,0,Yeah, and you got small hands too!
41,6,4,Slaying you could make America Great Again.
45,16,2,Thanks for cauterizing that.
38,5,2,Saving the princess? Oh, no, I'm in this for the dragon selfie!
50,7,7,It's great that we don't keep score and everyone gets a trophy at the end.
29,3,0,Thou breathest fire, yet still carry a sword? Then nay, thou shall not advance to the 'Game of Thrones' audition room!
28,0,1,I should have chosen fire breathing.
33,1,1,What do you mean it is a fair fight...all I have is BAD breath!
60,22,9,If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kingdom!
45,10,6,It was a lot more exciting before the emission standards.
34,3,1,You better work on that lunge!
38,4,2,Gas prices are killing me.
34,2,1,Just because you're the king's one armed son don't think I'm going to go easy on you."

46,13,4,We can break if you promise I'm not lunch.
37,5,0,If I could breathe fire I would. You're the one saying this wasn't a fair fight.
29,3,0,How about best two out of three?
35,5,1,Explain to me again why I have to play by YOUR rules?
28,1,0,For his royal highness, I act on a wing and a prayer.
41,17,1,Just breathe through your nose.
30,3,0,Dragon Heart sucked.
50,15,4,Hold your fire, this is a sword fight.
34,2,1,You're lucky, I decided to cut out fried food of my diet.

33,5,0,I wouldn't go over the middle with those arms
46,16,3,You do realize this is a no smoking arena?
37,8,2,Puff was no friend of mine either.
28,2,0,We simply cannot co-exist.
38,11,1,This workout will get you fired up.
31,0,0,How To Train Your Dragon part 18 was very boring.
33,6,0,You shouldn't have eaten Jackie Paper, Puff!
41,12,2,No, Gerald, I would NOT prefer to arm wrestle.
28,2,0,Gordo's patience was severely tested by the terms of his parole.

44,12,3,Wait until you see from where I shoot fire.
36,3,2,I'm an ENT specialist. Let me take a look at that throat.
39,4,3,Killin's much easier when your pilot light stays lit.
26,0,0,No time for games Sir! We got a shoot to get to
29,3,0,Once we've completed your training, you'll be a force to be reckoned with!
27,2,0,Ahaaa...you're gas won't ignite!

33,6,0,Use of fire shall result in a loss of point
35,5,1,DreamWorks how not to train your dragon.
34,8,0,No, no, no! Your footwork's atrocious! How's the princess supposed to believe you slayed me?
34,7,0,Haha, you Dragons always fall for the pick your weapon trick!
39,4,3,Grrr, stupid pilot light!
33,2,1,Its time you learn to play by the white guy's rules
30,4,0,Gadzooks, Puff! Is that all you can summon up?
34,7,0,Silly Dragon, your nose hair is on fire

32,2,1,I shouldn't have taken that Zantac earlier.
44,8,4,OK. Just a few more practice slays.
36,9,0,Well at least I have a better reach.
32,4,0,You forgot the password again didn't you?
32,3,2,I'm a super delegate, I have an advantage at determining the outcome.
34,3,1,Talk to your union. Them's the rules.
29,2,0,And you say that now that you have been rescued from the pet trade, where they clipped you wings and stole your fire, you have to learn how to fight like a man?
33,7,0,We both have swords. Therefore, it's a fair fight.
33,8,0,The heartbreak of emphysema.
37,9,1,That dragon-slayer hype was just publicity from my agent. Let's go have a drink and settle this some other way.
47,4,1,Hey, you could be cleaning moats for your community service.
42,3,2,Not a bad parry, but you're toast.
46,11,7,Saint George. What's yours?
35,7,0,No, Sir Marco. What do they say about dragons who have small hands?
49,17,5,What part of "Smoke-Free Zone" don't you understand?
34,2,1,If you don't start following directions, I'm going to make you use your left hand, too!
46,12,4,This STILL seems unfair. Maybe if you switched arms?
49,10,5,I'm really not left handed.
45,5,5,If you burn my popcorn one more time . . .
28,1,0,I sincerely appreciate your chivalry in this matter.
33,5,0,I say en guarde, THEN you say touché!
42,10,3,Sure you could light me on fire. You can destroy me in one second - but then everyone's going to say "Well of course the dragon won, he can breathe fire!" Did you ever think about that?
38,4,3,I shall defeat thee, windmill!
44,8,4,Brought sword to a fire fight. I'm toast.

34,6,0,Mighty, you may be, but not mightier than the Pendragon.
37,2,3,Put down your weapon and fight like a man.
39,8,1,You're about to become extinct, so give it up.
38,10,1,Does your coach know you have a distinctive tell?
31,5,0,Chivalry's on life support.
26,2,0,Nice try Puff, don't hold your breath; a dragon can't win a sword fight!
31,7,1,C'mon. Switch to your left arm like me.
31,3,1,Damn! Outta gas.
64,26,10,Hey! You can't bring a flamethrower to a knife fight.
31,6,0,You need to work more on your form.
28,1,1,Hey Pal, save the theatrics for the Main Street Parade.
31,4,0,I'm a lefty. You may be screwed.
26,2,0,Hey, it's not my fault Sinclair is losing market share.
33,4,0,Maybe after this we can play some checkers ?

27,5,0,Remember, we agreed that who wins the coin toss gets to choose choice of weapon. I won, so stop sulking.
38,4,0,Differently-abled dragon.
42,6,3,Why the sword---the old flamethrower kaput?
33,3,0,Don't forget the rules now, no gouging, no kicking, and no fire breathing....
31,1,0,Dragons can't wield broadswords, Kyle. Its a two-handed weapon and yours don't meet. Plus you're not attuned to it...*sigh* Did you even READ the Monster Manual I gave you?
36,3,3,Will the angry mob be staying for dinner, sir?
28,1,0,Way to disrupt the fencing industry!
36,7,1,Have you tried the patches?
50,10,7,Decades after they parted, Little Jackie Paper regrets his decision to reconnect with Puff.
33,6,1,You're smart to keep up with technology.
28,2,0,Dang, I am left-handed.
46,10,4,I know, mine stopped covering sword wounds too.
51,18,5,So much for frolicking in the autumn mist.
51,23,3,It's called cross-training.
53,12,8,So tomorrow, you bring the fire and I'll bring the marshmallows.
40,13,1,If you didn't smoke so much you wouldn't be so out of breath .
44,8,4,Sorry Puff, this is Colorado. You've lost your magic!
37,11,0,Excuse me, this is a non-smoking duel.
28,0,0,Knight: I shall slay you dragon! Dragon: Let's dance.
38,8,1,I despise second-hand smoke.
34,1,2,If your species hadn't evolved, you could just eat me.
39,9,3,Shoulda brought my pen?
30,3,0,Let's drop the swords and make it an even fight.
30,4,0,Call me George!
70,36,14,It's a fair fight as long as you keep your mouth shut.
41,3,5,Seriously, can't we just settle this over a beer.
33,7,1,This isn't a fair fight. You have a shield and I don't.
44,10,4,If you don't learn modern warfare you certainly will be extinct.
33,7,0,If it was my challenge you could have chosen flamethrowers, but you challenged, I selected too short swords.
36,6,1,Wait! Before we start, do you need a drink of water?
31,5,0,I'll show you who has short arms!
49,19,3,After this, do you want to go frolic in the Autumn mist?
29,2,0,Are you sure you want to play me?
28,2,0,But this is fair from my point of view.
30,2,0,Enough with the spoilers.

35,4,1,I know what your're thinking, did he use 6 carbon credits or 5.....?
27,0,0,Along with my image on your shield, you too must cease and desist.
38,3,2,Maybe if you did Crossfit you could become a real firebreather.
34,6,0,All right then - two out of three.

37,3,1,Sure, come on and try to slay me, Mr. Tiny Hands.
35,6,1,Come on puff, can't we rekindle just a little of that 60s magic?
31,3,0,Grace and poise are a swordsman's true weapons, my squire, and you'll never seduce a princess with that dragon-breath.
27,1,0,It weren't for cap and trade I would have turned you into a cinder.
37,3,2,I'm trying to give you an equal opportunity here!
29,1,0,Calm down. I'm pivoting to Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.
30,2,0,Equality, not equity.
38,8,1,I haven't seen a forearm like that since the '68 Wimbledon.
29,1,0,No fair! Fire extinguishers haven't been invented yet!
35,6,1,Touché? You’ll soon be toast.
33,5,0,Can we please come up with a secret handshake instead? None of our enemies think we look cool when we do this.

50,17,5,Thanks for leveling the playing field.
56,22,6,Wait a minute, when did you get opposable thumbs?

30,0,1,I, John the Great, have come to slay you! Knock, knock...
30,3,0,That's it joker...you breathed fire on my chainmail butt for the last time.
30,0,1,Where's your hot blond mother?
41,5,2,This fight sure is dragon on
31,4,0,I really need to get an agent who can tell apart dragon from dragoon.
49,12,7,It's not about size--it's how you use it.

37,8,1,This has been so much easier since the Geneva Protocol.
55,16,8,Hell of a day to catch a cold, hey?
36,5,2,This is still not a fair fight; you need to switch hands.
32,5,0,I'm just a trainer, don't be so serious!
39,12,2,One day, this will be a game.
46,10,5,Where'd it all go wrong, Puff?

33,5,0,Keep spitting fire. This is my warm-up.
31,5,1,Would you like some fries with me?
31,4,0,Looks like we're in for a contested convention.
30,1,1,Aw c'mon. At least you'd eat me fair and square.
35,2,2,I didn't say you'd make haste like a chicken. I said you'd probably taste like chicken.
41,7,3,I promise this is exactly how it happens in Game of Thrones
36,2,3,Bernie vs. Trump

27,0,0,Award-winning cheddar meets macaroni. You're welcome.

36,7,1,Oh, sure, I should just let you breathe fire on me. Yeah, that's fair.
30,2,0,Hey does your Mom ever ground you? Wonder what that looks like...
30,3,0,Slay girl, slay.

43,8,3,I know you are steamed but I did not mean anything when I commented about the size of your hand.
34,4,0,Methinks the wall our King ordered built wasn't high enough.
40,6,3,Mind if I smoke?
29,2,0,The deal was that you parry once, lunge twice to the left, fall down and play dead!

32,5,0,Sorry buddy. House rules.

36,7,1,How long must this battle drag on?
35,3,1,No, you're STILL, not doing it right!
48,13,4,Call me 'Puff' one more time and I'm running you through.

40,11,1,Tell me, 'I live by the sea' and call me 'Puff' one more time and I'll show you what 'magic' really means.
34,6,1,Oh, stop complaining about you "alligator arms!" Do you hear me going on about my inability to breathe fire?
30,3,0,I told you we should have used the flame throwers to even it up!
43,6,4,Ever try swallowing it?
30,3,0,You're a right-y. How is that fair?
36,6,1,Huge Dino loses his temper when someone makes fun of his small hands!
30,2,0,I sure feel safer with our agreement not to use fire or flight in war, don't you?

35,6,1,I heard you needed some help blowing off steam
28,1,1,Dragon could not help think the DNC rigged the rules.
44,10,3,Uncool to bring a fire-breathing dragon to a sword fight.

32,6,0,Quit complaining, Puff the Moody Dragon...
28,0,0,I was dragon, too" "Are you serious!?

31,1,0,Geesh! Another one just hoping to meet my mother.
31,7,0,Remember--we agreed you wouldn't breathe fire if I wouldn't.
32,4,0,My name is GEORGE, not Doofess Head, you smelly fish.
30,1,0,Don't be too sure of yourself because you got lucky once.
33,2,1,Let me guess, you're his right arm.
28,2,2,We'll be the best of friends in the season 2 prequel flashbacks
