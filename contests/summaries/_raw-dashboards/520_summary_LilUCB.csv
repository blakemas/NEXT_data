52,32,16,So, how have you been doing since the split?
24,0,2,I thought we worked through your wish that I slip on you.
16,1,0,Michael, you're bruising! I need you to tell me what's wrong.
22,5,2,For how long have you felt that you are really a vegetable?
20,2,2,Sometimes a penis is just a penis.
19,1,1,When did these anxieties about vegans begin?
21,3,1,Working with Chaquita was great. Now it's nothing but slapstick.
35,21,6,Look I don't say this to patients often, but you really are bananas.
18,1,1,I want to split with Sundae.
24,3,3,So he decided to split with you on Sunday over another banana?
30,20,3,Yes, I can see how you feel empty inside.
17,1,0,Just because you made that guy slip doesn't make you any less appealing. They were laughing with you, not at you.
18,1,0,After twenty five years of marriage we split. Just like that. Can you believe it doc? Now my life is so empty. I just can't seem to hold it together.
29,8,4,When did you first have these feelings of emptiness?
22,2,2,It seems my last patient left their banana peel on my chair.
21,4,1,Well, it depends. Did you want to make her fall?
36,11,1,Tell me more about how you caused your father's demise.
24,3,3,...and then there was the time my own Freuder –ahem– father, slipped on me!
20,3,1,How did you feel when he slipped?
16,2,0,I scream! You've deserted yourself!
30,14,4,Tell me more about feeling empty inside.
21,5,1,I agree feelings of emptiness can be consistent with narcissistic personality disorder, but perhaps we've overlooked something.
26,3,0,Don't blame yourself. In three days she would have moved on anyway.
37,20,7,You still blame yourself for the split?
20,4,0,But then you laughed anyway.
17,3,1,So when you yelled back, 'Eat my lunch, Buddy!' what did you expect?
21,5,1,ah Banana Ana Fo Fana, 'tis time for your fee fi fo fana
18,4,0,If she can't see your appeal, that's her problem.
16,1,0,Mr Peele, it appears you have a severe case of Flooraphobia
24,6,1,So you've made some slip ups... Tell me more.
23,4,2,And you say he abandoned you at a condom demonstration?
27,10,3,I do apologize, sir. I missed breakfast.
18,4,0,Another Freudian slip on a banana peel!
24,9,2,Well, it was a very difficult split
24,3,0,I've noticed you often use the phrase, "I slipped up on that one." Why do you think you do that?
19,5,0,...and you say I'm appealing?
36,9,4,Are you here from Costa Rica LEGALLY?
16,1,0,You know we discussed this before. The operation was not going to solve all your problems.
28,6,2,Don't slip on your way out.
13,0,0,Are you sure you requested a Jungian analysis?
26,5,3,How do you peel about this?
13,1,0,Sometimes I just feel I'm slipping.
20,0,0,If you really want to be of use, I suggest you get yourself into a brown bag with your unripe friend avocado!!
20,5,0,So I hear you saying that you feel you pose a substantial threat of physical harm to others.
18,4,0,I know I'm better than that couch potato
32,12,5,Yours is the clearest case of an unresolved edible complex I have encountered in years.
19,4,1,How long have you been peeling this way?
22,2,2,So, your mother was your first victim?
18,1,0,Women don't find me apeeling.
35,13,6,You can't keep blaming yourself for other people's slip-ups.
16,1,0,So, when did you start to feel that you were beginning to slip?
22,1,3,Our relationship is just fruitless.
32,15,5,And how did this tremendous fear of monkeys begin?
15,1,0,Do you mean emotionally walked all over?
38,4,1,Now..., you say you were referred to me by an existing patient?
18,3,0,You've got to stop trying to give people the slip.
27,4,0,Now, about this feeling that you're tripping up everyone ...
21,5,1,How long has it been since the banana split?
19,2,0,I appreciate the offer, but it's a slippery slope.
22,3,2,Lets get past the fact that you are garbage, and move on to relationships.
16,1,0,They always blame me for Freudian slips.
23,12,0,Doctor, there's something that's been eating away at me.
16,2,0,Yes, I do find you appealing.
25,9,1,But I feel like a vegetable.
17,1,0,I lack appeal.
27,9,2,I feel like I got nothing left inside.
18,3,0,Despite the anti-immigrant sentiment in the country, you must come to grips with the fact that your mother was a plantain.
15,0,0,I'm waiting for the day someone slips on me and says, 'sorry, banana peel, I didn't notice you were rotting there.'
21,1,1,I'm starting to think I have abandonment issues.
23,3,2,The split has been so hard on the kids that they're considering a foster home.
15,0,0,Now, let's pretend that I'm a therapist and that you're a bana - oops, you are, a banana peel.
16,0,0,Please kiss me. I desperately want to turn into a prince.
19,1,1,"Continual denial is bringing you right back to that slippery slope".
27,6,3,You weren't abandoned. You were picked.
21,6,1,So tell me how you are peeling today.
20,7,0,So how long were you and this 'Chiquita' engaged?
21,3,1,Surely, it was a Freudian slip.
45,26,12,You do realize in a couple of days none of this will matter.
24,7,1,My future feels like a slippery slope
18,3,0,No one would be falling all over you if you weren't so slippery.
28,6,4,So what do think’s causing all these slip-ups?
30,8,3,Does Mrs. Peel know about the slip-and-fall lawsuits?
23,5,1,In order to peel away the layers of your problems I'd suggest group...I mean bunch...therapy.
26,2,3,So, how did you feel when someone stepped on you, slipped and fell?
21,8,0,So you feel like you're heading down a slippery slope.
17,2,0,Yes, I can treat you for an irrational fear of hurting someone.
18,2,0,You appear to be a very slippery fellow.
15,0,0,Interesting ... now can you tell me WHY the duck is sitting on your head?
21,1,2,Yes, I agree, perhaps you should have seen it coming, but honestly, it happens every single day.
29,10,3,What makes you think he just wanted you for your body?
40,6,2,So you have abandonment issues
30,11,4,I don't think a banana can "go bananas".
25,2,1,I'm proud of you for sharing your peelings.
29,0,0,you are not a shrinking violet are you?
27,4,4,I was once the top banana, then I split.
22,7,1,It is sad you lost Grandma, but there are millions of other Nanas out there.
18,2,0,How does it make you feel to be the source of so many Freudian slips?
20,0,1,It's not your fault that Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee for President.
15,0,0,It just just took a shrink to minimize the fruit of my existence
15,0,0,It is natural to feel like garbage after being fired. But on the positive side, being a rainmaker for a slip and fall lawyer is not exactly honorable work.
16,0,0,Tell me more about this recurring nightmare that starts with someone asking, “Is that a banana in your pocket…”
27,9,3,I was top banana until I lost my wife on a Sundae.
20,7,0,Look, it's a slippery slope, but we can go there if you need to...
21,4,1,I only get laughs when people step on me.
28,10,4,Which is the bigger issue: feeling dangerous or empty?
22,4,1,Sometimes everyone feels a little empty.
21,2,2,Your parents were in a split when you were younger?
18,0,1,I'm feeling bruised and empty, just like the rest of the bunch.
15,0,0,So you're telling me that everyone says you bring them down, but you call them all clowns.
20,7,0,It's not so much that I feel empty inside, it's that I feel used.
22,6,1,Don't worry, you'll get stepped on one day.
43,23,10,I think we can rule out low potassium as the cause of your depression.
27,8,3,Note to self: this one is completely bananas.
25,5,1,I'm sorry, I slipped up.
16,1,0,Would you prefer women didn't find you appealing?
25,6,3,Sounds like separation anxiety.
22,3,1,Nobody's used that gag for years. Get over it!
24,5,2,I'm referring you out. I don't treat fruits.
22,5,2,How long have you had a split personality?
20,3,1,And when you were peeled, how did that make you feel?
22,2,2,So you feel you unconsciously willed him to fall?
24,9,1,Are you surprised you let that slip?
47,15,13,And when did you start identifying as a plantain?
28,3,5,I wasn't ready.
22,4,1,How would you like it, Doc, if they ripped off all of your clothes?
29,4,5,Why sidewalks?
16,1,0,'I'm falling for you'
23,7,1,It seems like everything is one big punchline to you.
27,11,3,When did you realize you were not organic?
17,4,0,So, the end of vaudeville made you feel low...
27,5,4,They're not laughing at you. They're laughing at him.
15,0,0,I think you can make me , Doc.
38,16,8,I'm leaning towards banana split personality, but there a bunch of other possibilities
16,1,0,You know, your appeal with me is slipping......
18,3,0,I keep dreaming that I'm in a jungle being chased by apes and I can't escape.
24,6,1,I was nuts. Now I seem to be full-on bananas.
14,1,0,When do you believe you started down that slippery slope of ice cream addiction?
32,4,4,. . . and you said you went . . . what?
25,0,4,And how did that make you feel -- the no-slip sole?
26,6,3,I'm sorry to hear that. How are you coping with the split?
13,0,0,So, how did that make you peel, er, I mean feel?
21,6,1,Ever since I opened up to you it has felt like something went missing.
38,8,3,Of course you are appealing...
20,6,0,Good work! You've discovered your inner self.
31,5,6,Why do you think you feel empty inside?
18,4,0,Tell me about your slippery days.
28,6,3,How long have you been having these feelings of emptiness?
27,6,4,... but the important thing is that YOU know sometimes a banana is just a banana
19,1,1,Well, in your case going bananas may not be all that bad.
22,3,2,You're not a nut case.
35,27,4,Actually, I charge by the hour, not per pound. Why do you ask?
24,1,3,Larry, you can still take pride in your professional accomplishments even if you're only second banana at the firm.
21,5,1,Let's begin with why you feel like you are prone to so many slipups.
16,0,0,And how does that make you peel? I feel like something is missing inside.
25,11,0,So your dream was about a band of hungry monkeys.
33,20,4,When did you start feeling this emptiness inside?
31,9,7,When did you first realize you were really a plantain?
18,4,0,How do you feel about your lack of an inner banana?
22,1,0,It's just that you have a threatening look about you.
23,4,2,Let's try and peel back some more layers
35,8,8,Tell me about your first split.
16,1,0,Come again - you think the hands at the other end of the hoe might have been your mothers?
21,7,2,So how long have you had these feelings of being totally discarded?
35,20,5,Everything's a "slippery slope" to you.
19,2,1,Don't worry about making a Freudian slip. I'm a Jungian.
18,0,1,You are saying you have a banana sized hole in your life you're trying to fill, go on...
22,3,2,Sometimes you work so hard to peel away a patient's exterior persona and there's just bupkis underneath it all.
24,4,2,So tell me, why do you think you're a couch potato?
14,0,0,So, how did you decide on yellow?
26,9,2,Your lack of an inner-self appears to be the crux of the problem.
17,2,1,So you think you're responsible for the split?
19,3,0,No one ever finds me appeeling enough. It's always orange, orange, orange.
12,0,0,Its a slippery slope, Doc
29,3,4,Can you elaborate on this "rotten feeling" your having.
18,2,1,So, how's your transgender transformation going?
24,5,3,It all started when a bunch of us got together for a friendly breakfast...
26,16,6,I feel like my whole life's been a joke.
23,4,2,You use your slipperiness as your greatest defense, but deep inside, you feel truly empty.
20,2,1,Your mother sounds like a real bitch.
39,8,3,It's been six months, Lucille. I don't think he's coming back.
21,1,2,You don't need a therapist to put you back together, you need a zipper.
26,9,0,"How long do you feel you've been slipping?
20,6,0,I'm hearing that it was really hard for you when your dad split.
33,5,0,So being the top banana slipped away,....get over it!
33,8,4,Now tell me what's going on inside.
17,0,1,So you feel you have slipped up
25,7,1,Lets talk about your feelings of emptiness.
23,2,2,Now I understand what they meant by "side-effects."
18,2,0,No, you shouldn't feel any sense of inferiority being the frontrunner's backup hairdo.
22,0,1,He's just not that into you.
18,3,0,Sure I am soft hearted but why do they blame me for giving them the slip?
18,0,0,Whether he comes back for this or not, the world is surely going to devour him.
16,2,0,Of course others find you appealing.
20,6,0,No, I think you're appealing.
21,2,0,That is a slimy thought.
20,5,0,It's what's on the inside that counts.
17,0,0,No, euphemistic banana split is not a Freudian slip.
25,7,0,When did you first feel that you were coming "unpeeled"?
16,1,0,The clowns are trying to kill me. I've been stepped on 37 times this week.
18,2,0,Pardon my Freudian slip.
26,3,0,You say you want me to walk on you?
27,4,4,Tell me about your last Freudian slip
26,4,0,Damn . . . I can hardly resist your appeal !
18,4,0,I see you're learning to pull back your skin and show your true self.
25,2,0,Some things just can't be helped.
26,5,1,Can you elaborate on this empty feeling?
16,1,0,I know life can be slippery, but you can't allow it to trip you up.
46,21,13,Why do you feel the work we're doing is fruitless?
32,17,4,Have you talked to a doctor about getting it reattached?
22,6,1,So you're not top banana anymore ...... get over it!
22,7,1,You know sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel
37,16,8,What you've experienced is a Freudian slip.
16,0,0,Its not your fault. It was your owners choice to give your body to this ice cream.
17,2,0,You want to be more than just A Peeling?
39,6,0,having sex with your patient isn't an ethics violation if the patient is a fruit.
19,4,1,We can finish talking about your peelings next week; it's time for me to split.
19,1,0,Is that a banana or are you just glad to see me?
22,5,0,Peeling away that ego is a good first step.
23,10,1,I WOULD NOT REFER TO THIS SESSION AS FRUITLESS
16,2,0,You're just a slip of a thing
20,1,0,What would Freud say about you talking to me?
21,5,1,So my wife got nuts and I split.
22,2,2,And how does that make you feel when people now think you're an orange knocking at their door?
18,3,0,Don't worry, you're not the first to make a Freudian slip.
14,0,0,He overheard hunter's wife say he only shoots blanks.
18,1,1,Sorry, but unless you fully accept me when I open up we can not have a fruitful conversation.
22,6,1,Is that a banana on your cushion or are you just happy to see me?
18,5,0,There is more to life than slip and fall.
13,1,0,We're not talking about the slips of others...we're talking about yours!
25,8,2,Ever since I opened up to my girlfriend, I've had this very empty feeling inside.
31,7,1,Sorry. 'Nuts' would have been more diplomatic
19,2,1,Do you blame yourself for keeping the doctor away?
24,1,3,I think we've established that your anxiety started when your parents split.
14,0,0,No, I am not going to enable your penis envy any more. It's time to move on.
21,5,0,You were great, but let's talk about your 'second act'
19,1,1,Your payments are on a sliding scale.
24,7,1,So this emptiness you've been feeling....
25,4,2,Stop with the Freudian slip jokes, already!
20,3,1,Tell me about the conversations before he split.
30,2,1,You say you feel stepped on and ridiculed?
15,0,0,Well, Freud said that we are perfect, but we are missing our spears.
21,4,1,I only accept Apple Pay.
15,0,0,That *is* the technical term for your condition.
26,10,4,Survivor's guilt is perfectly normal.
15,1,0,He really is going bananas.
19,3,1,I know I should have considered the consequences, but it was so funny in the cartoons
41,26,9,So you feel that people are going out of their way to avoid you.
22,0,0,They think I don't have feelings.
37,12,8,Don't get all mushy on me.
18,0,1,Don't let one slip eat you up inside.
24,3,2,Your guilt complex isn't difficult to understand.
23,8,2,When did you first start feeling empty inside?
43,22,12,How long has your life seemed fruitless?
16,1,0,And what happened next?
27,9,3,When did you notice that people are trying to avoid you?
26,7,3,There are no more layers to peel.
17,4,1,What makes you feel everyone is trying to avoid you?
18,2,0,Yes, but for a peel, but you have appeal.
34,10,6,"Feelings of emptiness are common for someone in your position".
28,8,4,Well, you're right. Sometimes a banana is just a banana, but.....
24,8,2,Yes, I do understand emptiness.
26,9,3,It sounds like you need more potassium.
18,2,1,Everyone keeps stepping on me.
24,9,1,Have you ever asked why you feel the need to open yourself up to complete strangers?
20,3,1,Let's talk about your self-esteem. Do you think that others find you a'peeling?
21,5,1,You shouldn't feel guilty just for making people laugh.
17,0,0,And when did this war injury occur?
29,14,3,I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who think you're still funny.
14,0,0,The world's changing….I think I'm the one that's slipping!
17,4,0,How did causing that slip make you feel?
15,0,0,How do you say you are doing the opposite of coming out of your shell?
39,15,11,So what I hear you saying is, now that we have peeled back the layers, you feel empty inside.
16,1,0,I'm impressed by your agility to roll around on the floor. Now please get up on the couch and put your jacket back on.
15,1,0,Easy to get a complex when you are just apealing .
19,1,1,But I don't think you could be more appealing than you are right now.
19,3,1,Have you considered not trying to be funny all the time?
18,5,0,It's usually best to establish trust before opening up to someone.
21,7,0,Tell me about your rotten childhood.
18,2,1,I assure you, feeling abandoned and that your life is a joke is very normal for someone in your current state.
19,1,0,Tell me about your relationship with Pogo
22,2,2,A diagnoses of "he went bananas" is so 80's.
31,11,4,Let's talk about your family tree.
26,6,1,I thought I had tough skin, by I always feel empty inside.
14,0,1,You're thinking only skin-deep--get to the substance!
35,3,1,I understand it isn't easy to open up to me without your bunch
16,1,0,He said I have appeal for you before he fell out the window. It was a classic Freudian slip.
14,1,0,This is a peel to your imagination.
16,0,0,She gave me the slip, peeled off, and left me nothing but a husk.
16,1,0,What makes you think people are laughing at you?
25,9,2,She took all of me. I feel so empty inside.
23,4,2,Don't feel bad, he could have just as easily been hit by a truck.
20,2,0,Your parents may not be human, but you’re still entitled to blame them for your problems
16,0,0,He's a chutzparrot.
19,1,1,When did this feeling of abandonment start?
29,3,0,Under the right circumstances you could be half of a comedy team, you have a future in show business. Forget being furniture oil.
21,7,0,I really feel like I've been slipping lately
25,6,2,'And you think the Freudian kind is taken more seriously than yours?'
18,3,0,Do you remember where you were when you first noticed that "you lost it?"
15,1,0,Green, yellow, brown-- now black—can’t seem to fit in.
29,14,3,So, what makes you think I would fall for you?
25,13,2,I know how difficult this split's been for you.
14,0,0,We discussed invisibility as a side effect ... but I'm going to mark that your "Man Problems" have subsided
20,3,1,Nice slip
18,3,0,How did you feel when your parents split?
29,11,3,Do you still feel that everyone you come into contact with ends up hurt?
18,4,0,Well, you've certainly got appeal.
21,4,1,And why is that a Freudian slip?
19,1,0,So shall we call this "wish fulfillment"?
17,3,0,So you aren't happy to see me?
18,4,0,We call it splitting....
20,1,0,How are you coping with this deep sense that your life's mission has passed on to others?
28,10,3,No, a fear of clowns is really very common.
34,9,7,You think you got problems. I just ate a client.
20,5,0,Why do they call me a slippery character?
23,4,1,You really shouldn't worry so much. I'm sure people find you appealing.
16,1,0,It was just one slip up.
29,0,0,Yes, and Mr. Bad stole you, the real banana inside.
18,3,1,So, when did this fear of people stepping on you begin?
20,2,1,Perhaps she only wanted you to think that her vulnerabilities were in the palm of your hand, Mr. Kong. Mr. Kong?
31,21,3,And who do you feel second to?
24,8,2,Explain to me again why you feel your life is so fruitless.
18,3,0,Quit monkeying with me.
29,4,4,When I told you to try peeling back the layers, I meant of your subconscious.
21,4,1,Let's role play—I'll be the banana peel and you be the one slipping
15,0,0,Have you tried less ethylene?
19,5,0,So, you're saying that size does matter. Tell me more.
16,1,0,Have you considered taking responsibility for your actions, having some skin in the game?
30,6,4,Look, I admit you have appeal, but sometimes a banana is just a banana.
25,5,3,You're not the best banana in the world today. And that's okay.
36,21,6,Tell me again how he fell for you
24,8,2,She was only interested in my body.
23,5,1,I feel empty since Chiquita left me.
24,8,2,This is a breakthrough. You finally opened up.
17,2,0,Yes Edna I did say if you want to beat depression you must have 100 percent skin in the game but you take things so literally
15,0,0,You don't want to join the Banana Peal Challenge"
26,11,2,I'm here because of a split.
30,10,4,I understand your guilt complex about the ones you've hurt, but remember, you're the one getting stepped on.
21,6,1,Tell me more about your father. You said he was always just hanging around?
24,5,3,My wife says I've lost my appeal.
17,2,0,Actually, you're my first post-op trans-banana.
20,3,1,So you feel people are laughing at you, not with you.
43,17,12,It seems to me like you may be struggling with an eaten disorder
16,1,0,Do you resent being the butt of cartoon jokes?
14,0,0,I prefer my fruitcakes without banannas.
19,5,0,If only we could peel away some more of your past.
36,25,5,In retrospect, do you feel the trip to zoo was a good idea?
15,0,0,If you site like this, with your peels crossed, I'm sure the jokes will stop.
23,4,2,How do you feel when people insist that, biologically, you're a berry?
29,3,4,My life just seems fruitless!
21,5,2,You're not a joke.
17,0,0,So, h
15,0,0,Forget the Onion. Try pealing back these layers.
23,4,2,First, let's lose that negative self-image, OK? Your appeal is that you're a peel.
17,0,0,I had a terrible dream with mommies...I mean monkeys staring right at me
16,2,0,Divorce can be devastating, but nothing compares to a banana split.
20,3,0,I'll see you at group next week with a bunch
23,5,1,So when did you feel life was slipping away from you?
20,2,0,Please don't take this personally but I'm not sure if I'm qualified to help you!
15,0,0,Tony! I thought you would never change
22,2,2,I apologize for wearing heels today... I will make a note that they are a trigger for your anxiety.
31,9,5,No, I don't think Viagra will help you.
21,3,0,Our time's up. Please see yourself ALL THE WAY out
18,3,0,Why these are Manolo Blahniks, why do you ask?
19,5,0,When was it you first realised you no longer had any more skin in the game ?
28,9,4,It seems you have a banana split personality.
23,4,2,I just can't peel back any more layers.
25,8,2,I can assure you, the recurring dream of being stepped on is no joke.
32,17,5,You need to stop blaming yourself for the accident.
33,14,4,My, aren't we thin skinned!
19,2,1,So, Mr. Peel...you feel as if you are the butt of every joke...
15,0,0,I get this rush when someone slips on me and cries out in pain. Is that normal?
27,13,2,Tell me more about this 'empty' feeling.
19,1,0,So, you think your skin is unappealing?
24,9,2,Try to be optimistic. Slapstick could always make a comeback.
16,1,1,Why do you think people can't see beyond your skin?
65,7,3,How long have you felt like a fruit trapped in a berry's body?
44,0,1,What makes you say I've become a shrinking violet?
14,0,0,O. M. G! Now I need therapy–and a huge fruit salad...
27,13,2,Potassium dependency can be treated.
20,1,2,Don't tell me...you are slipping back again.
19,0,2,Just because Tyler wants to go out of state to college doesn't mean he is rejecting you as a mother.
17,2,0,Let's start with, 'nanner, nanner, boo boo'.
19,3,0,What makes you think you've lost your appeal?
17,3,1,Berry, I know you are misunderstood, but you have thick skin.
19,1,1,When you chose a career in show business, do you feel you were just reinforcing your need to be stepped on?
22,2,2,And so I told him, "I wasn't asking to be eaten because I wore this."
14,0,0,Oh, you poor thing!
20,1,2,Your suggestion that this endeavor is fruitless could be interpreted as a projection.
20,3,1,And how long have been hearing these screaming voices above you?
23,1,3,Of course there's more to you than just physical humor.
24,6,1,Frankly, you don't even look bruised.
19,2,1,When did this fear of slopes begin?
23,4,2,let's discuss why you believe you're unappealing
36,10,8,Have you considered you might not be as funny as you used to be?
20,3,1,Indeed a slippery slope to be top banana again.
23,1,3,So how do you peel?
20,2,1,Your separation anxiety seems to be tripping up everyone you meet.
43,20,11,Of course, you didn't cause all those accidents.
39,16,9,Twenty brothers and sisters? Wow, that's a bunch!
16,2,0,So, how long have you had this peeling feeling?
17,2,0,Everyone slips up sometimes.
35,26,6,What do you mean you bring people down?
43,25,11,It's not your fault - accidents happen.
19,1,1,The pratfalls don't get laughs anymore, just compassion and Day-o, Day-o, Day-o.
17,2,0,Seems like all that clown ever wants to do is step all over me.
36,13,7,I'm afraid that you're an accident waiting to happen.
20,3,1,You can blame your parents all you want but I still believe those bruises are natural.
17,0,1,So your Mom said you need a job with more prestige?
26,5,3,While I do find you appealing, you should know I don't date my patients.
22,8,1,And how are things going with your friends? Are you still hanging with the same bunch?
17,2,0,Why should I feel guilty for her fall? She shouldn't have been wearing those silly backless Why should I feel guilty for her fall? She shouldn't have been wearing those silly little backless shoes!
19,1,1,Last week we talked about how self-actualization was driving you bananas...How's that going?
35,16,5,How long have you wanted to come out?
16,0,0,No, it's perfectly natural for you to be aroused by a drawing of a member of the opposite sex. That's totally normal, not only for banana peels, but also for grown men who have steady jobs and even, perhaps, a popular Tumblr blog. Totally normal.
23,6,0,I just really feel like I'm not myself anymore, like my inner self has been ripped out of me.
20,2,1,Now tell me- how did that make you peel?
34,7,4,Why do you think you always feel the need to be funny?
33,10,5,You suffer from a banana split personality
95,76,53,I'm going to be brutally honest. You're an accident waiting to happen.
30,15,4,Don't worry, I see lots of patients with split personalities.
16,1,0,Are you at all concerned with your habitual need to incite slippage.
22,3,2,So, when did you start feeling you weren't appealing?
19,4,0,Yes, but the people who fall and hit their heads don't really care if the slip is Freudian or not.
22,5,1,>> And how does that make you peel--I mean, feel? >>*Sigh*...Like I'm going bananas.
18,1,0,I'm a poor hunter, but at least I'm not reading a pretentious magazine.
20,3,1,I'm too thin-skinned.
16,1,0,So why do you think people are always walking all over you?
30,7,4,Well, you may think it was a slip, but I think it was a relapse.
26,6,2,What you're describing is separation anxiety and, given your time together, that's perfectly normal.
15,0,0,"You're right...you do not have any six a-peel".
36,12,7,So you're afraid you might be a danger to others?
34,16,6,On the phone, you said something was eating away at you...
15,1,0,Apparently he's sold that chump on that "one in hand is worth two in the bush" nonsense!
17,4,0,But why do only think it's funny if someone gets hurt?
21,5,1,Diagnosis? Classic split personality.
30,6,6,So you hurt people, but you don't mean to?
19,2,1,...and after the split, I met Foster...
20,4,0,Personally, I find something very appealing about you.
32,15,4,Why am I always the fall guy?
22,3,2,What you've described here is textbook penis envy.
24,6,2,Let's talk about why you call your ex-husband a big ape.
26,7,3,Textbook Freudian slip.
28,7,4,. . . but in your case whipped cream, nuts and fudge are suggestive of a split personality . . .
22,3,2,so...what did YOU slip on?
17,0,0,The banana peel is challenged.
28,8,3,When your mom split, how did that make you peel?
40,5,3,Isn't it always about the monkey on your back?
30,3,1,Why does it bother you to been seen as slippery ?
19,4,0,The bunch is lonely too.
17,2,0,Slipping on your peel needs to be resolved.
38,18,8,How did you feel when you finally separated yourself from the bunch?
22,10,1,I'm going to certify you bananas.
28,9,4,After the split, how did you peel?
19,2,1,You've been causing a lot of Freudian slips.
18,2,1,When did you first feel like you were slipping?
15,0,0,Hollywood's hard on starlets and starfish—and you're both.
23,1,0,Tell me more about your fear of spectators.
20,2,1,So, talk about slapstick.
18,3,0,Do you want to be addressed as 'he,' 'she,' or..?
20,6,0,Ok, go ahead and tell me about your latest slip-up.
24,3,3,I find you very apealing.
25,3,2,So size is the big issue.
24,5,3,What else do you feel besides emptiness?
26,7,3,Lately it seems like everyone is avoiding me.
22,1,0,Honestly, I don't think I'd even recognize this Key person you keep talking about.
17,2,0,I feel like these days I'm so bruised up as time goes on
20,7,0,And why do you feel like you're always the fall guy?
17,2,0,Having a fear of being without a peel is not a slip of the tongue.
34,13,5,You need to stop seeing other people's missteps as your own.
16,2,0,You're telling me that your banana split for someone with a younger peel?
19,2,1,You did what!!!
16,0,0,Over a barrel or out on a limb--which one takes more pluck?
25,10,2,When did you first start to feel empty inside?
41,25,9,So you feel he treats you like trash?
54,21,19,Again with the guilt? He slipped. He fell. Get over it!
23,1,0,after all that, she stole my idea for the slip n' slide
23,5,2,And what exactly makes you feel these slips are Freudian?
18,3,0,I think you need to avoid that slippery slope.
24,7,3,You say you've lost your inner self?
22,3,1,What makes you think you caused a Freudian slip?
28,3,5,So you were born a banana but identify as a kumquat?
18,4,0,And stop calling me mama
18,1,1,Is this real life or am I in therapy?
41,26,9,Now let's discuss your fear of primates...
19,4,0,It seems you are heading down a slippery slope.
25,5,1,And then, she just split.
17,3,0,Why do you feel like you have a split personality?
18,4,0,And you say people walk all over you, despite your appeal?
17,3,0,Slippage is your problem. That's why you have no friends.
47,25,13,I give up. What makes a Freudian slip?
17,1,0,One slip is not tantamount to a fall!
21,3,0,And how do you peel about that?
18,3,0,She says I'm not appealing.
49,28,17,And in this recurring nightmare, nobody slips?
40,5,4,So when did you start feeling responsible for Freudian slips?
17,2,0,Hmmm... and how does your appeal slipping make you feel?
19,3,1,I don't think they're laughing *at* you.
19,1,1,Let's get in touch with your inner self.
24,2,3,I get thrown away, stepped on, and cursed.......I should be happy why ?
23,5,2,I was the only one in my bunch who didn't make Chiquita.
26,2,1,Orange you glad you are not a banana?
24,2,3,I just feel empty and angry,i want to hurt people make them slip and fall.
19,1,1,I'm tired of making people slip on the sidewalk. Ok...I've never made anyone slip on the sidewalk.
49,29,16,Interesting. I said 'smoothly,' but you heard 'smoothie.'
23,5,2,Yes. There is more to life than just pratfalls.
19,1,1,I don't know Doc, I literally feel split on the issue...
33,12,4,It seems that you have finally moved past your phallic stage.
35,25,6,I just don't have it in me anymore.
22,7,2,When did you feel that you were accident prone?
23,7,1,Don't be hard on yourself - the guy who just left here was a real nut!
28,8,3,No. A "Freudian slip" is a different thing.
33,13,6,Have you ever considered the possibility that they are not laughing at you?
24,5,2,When did you first start to feel unappealing?
22,5,2,Impersonating a starfish. Okay, other options for your next career?
21,6,0,"How long have you felt like you were just 'one in a bunch'?
23,4,2,Doc, I have nothing left inside.
17,2,0,So how long have you had these feelings of people always trying to undress you?
14,0,0,That bird has a pair of eggs on him.
17,2,0,Your fragrance is overpowering.
17,3,0,I can't believe you said you found me 'a peeling'
20,1,0,So, you've gone back to your cage before my first question?
18,1,0,So you're giving up your acting career to study the saxophone?
28,15,3,Sliding scale, I presume.
19,1,0,It's much healthier not to take those slipping on a banana peel jokes personally.
27,9,3,Yes, laughter is healthy, but not at the expense of others.
22,5,1,Things were going great until she split!
20,1,1,Please tell me more about that dream. So you were a stepping stone and then...?
23,1,4,You need to make amends with your bunch
26,5,3,When around your peers, do you feel comfortable in your own peel?
31,2,0,How much can I charge a banana?
20,8,0,So your mother was really a plantain......
15,3,0,That was around the time we split up
20,3,1,I understand why you detest monkeys.
23,4,1,If you could be a person, who would you be?
21,1,2,Please don't refer to your loss as, "he left you".
19,2,1,In my opinion, you're not nuts.
31,10,4,Well, your appealing nature is even hard for me to resist, after all, you are easy to fall for.
16,1,0,What I'm hearing you say, is that at least that experience didn't turn you into a vegetable.
16,0,0,The folks in my comedy group complain, say I’ve gone bananas. But, Doc, there are only so many times one can bear to be stepped on.
25,7,2,I'm tired of people just walking all over me.
19,2,1,'I'd say your peelings of emptiness are very organic'
19,2,1,So is what I hear you saying is that you feel like a rotting slippery empty shell?
39,14,9,As your doctor, I can honestly tell you you're not a couch-potato.
20,1,1,So, explain why you feel unfulfilled with your life?
16,1,0,How have you been feeling, slick?
16,0,0,Was that a fraudulent slip?
28,6,2,So I understand you are "Chiquita" but now want to be "United Fruit" ?
29,8,4,Do these episodes always occur in bunches?
21,7,1,Your going to have to forgive yourself for the harm you've caused to others.
21,5,1,And then...he gave me the slip !
21,5,1,So how long have you thought you were a banana?
21,1,2,I'm sure you do feel empty, but can you imagine how the monkey feels?
25,6,2,How do you feel when people call you "slippery?"
18,3,0,I've just never found psychotherapy very appealing.
17,0,0,You can't blame yourself if someone slips on you. It's not your fault, if everyone throws you away.
24,3,3,This recent split really took a toll on me
18,1,1,I just feel so empty on the inside these days.
18,2,0,"So you feel you're "not appealing" or is it that you feel you're "not a peeling".
22,5,2,None of my patients have peeled back the layers quite like you
33,3,2,So, are you single?
20,3,1,Goodness, I never thought that couch had appeal until now.
22,2,3,What did you expect? You were smothering her.
32,10,6,I'm hearing that your trouble comes in bunches.
15,0,0,You can't blame yourself-he was only a rabbit.
31,6,1,Naturally peeling and natural appeal are not the same thing.
30,7,4,That's okay, I'm not a Freudian.
20,6,0,Really, it was just a slip of the tongue.
21,0,1,Feed me Seymour! Is that all you ever think about?
17,0,1,They hate it when I point out their Freudian slips.
20,1,2,Was that uncomfortable for you?
36,21,7,I think, on some level, I like being stepped on.
19,0,2,I used to be a terrifying octopus - now look at me!
25,5,0,...and now we wait for the Freudian slip.
15,0,0,Your Open Mic nights at the Comedy Club seem to be working. I'm just a little upset myself at the 2 drink minimum.
25,1,0,I love bananas, but you are a left-over from my one o'clock.
32,9,6,How did you feel when your friends ripened and you didn't
20,0,0,Mr. Candidate for the President, what happened to your brain?
23,4,2,Sorry. Slip of the tongue.
33,20,4,It almost sounds like you want to be stepped on.
25,8,2,I couldn't help myself. I just finished working out and I was feeling hypoglycemic.
19,4,0,Tell me more about these feeling of abandonment. Where do you feel it in your body?
17,1,1,Everybody always blames ME for their slip-ups!!
28,5,1,Yep...I'm having that dream again.
21,5,1,I believe you may have banana-split-personality.
23,3,2,'So how long have you felt like you should have been born a plantain?'
22,7,1,Try thinking of yourself as a simple fruit instead of a complex carb.
18,2,1,You weren't consciously uncoupled. You split.
23,5,2,I have a Ph.d. in psychology, abnormal psychology, and a frequent shopper's card at the Fruit Emporium.
29,12,3,Well, I suppose the only thing left for you to do is compost yourself.
21,4,1,My girlfriend says I'm all appeal , and no substance!
29,10,3,You say you feel empty inside---tell me more.
20,0,1,Mr. Belknap, if brains were bones, you'd be a banana.
30,8,4,So, you say you feel empty and fear you could be a danger to yourself or others...
21,5,1,Let me get this: "Peel peel bo-beel, Banana-fana po’ feel?"
21,0,1,Once again we see the formidable hunter, totally in tune with his surroundings, continue on his quest for his elusive quarry.
25,10,2,"So you feel your life is slipping away"!
19,0,1,Patient: "Dr., I think I've lost my appeal." Doctor: "Nope, you've just gone bananas"
33,3,2,Feelings of inadequacy? Yes, and I just don't think I have appeal
27,0,0,Relax, Mr. Banana. Once more, what was it like before you lost your pulp?
17,2,0,I hear you've lost your sense of humor.
17,2,0,And you say everybody laughs at you?
22,5,1,So, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're worried that corporate might be looking to replace you because your current comedic skill-set has become outmoded?
20,2,0,Tell me more about your plaintain.
18,2,0,Sometimes I just slip into my emotions Doc...
77,46,32,Remind me what happened after the split
14,0,0,Yes, I can see you were ravaged from the backend. Be grateful- I haven't had as much as a nibble in the past 18 months.
18,0,1,I slipped up again doc
18,2,0,Don't underestimate your sex appeal.
17,0,0,Oh, I don't know Mr. Trump...It seems your lobotomy went quite well.
27,5,0,It's normal to feel discarded, especially after the layers have been peeled away.
18,0,1,She split!
17,4,0,Just remember as we peel back your childhood, things can get slippery.
37,22,5,Are you sure people are avoiding you?
23,4,2,So you tell me how you peel?
40,11,10,I just haven't been myself since that Sundae...
15,0,0,You know, if you keep letting your husband walk all over you, he'll...hear a slide whistle, probably.
85,55,39,I'd like to see you again next sundae.
40,0,1,Quick, Henry, the banana spray!
26,8,3,You need to understand the difference between making a 'Freudian Slip' and making a Freud slip.
17,1,0,"The bloom is off;" "Shrinking violet;"-- Sticks and stones. . .
14,0,0,... and you've felt this way ever since you lost one of your four skins?
33,8,8,So, tell me, exactly when did the frozen smoothie nightmares begin?
23,6,3,Freudian slips come naturally to me.
22,8,1,So you feel you've been discarded?
18,2,0,Could you tell me more about how your family lost their bananas?
20,4,0,I don't think that's what your ex meant when she said you didn't have appeal.
23,4,1,Forgive yourself. You didn't intend for anyone to slip.
16,0,0,Yes, I agree, some in therapy are more prone to slips of the tongue than others.
21,4,1,Sorry, I didn't hear that, I have a banana in my ear.
25,8,2,Steve Martin walked away from comedy, so why can't you?
21,6,1,So, you say you lost your inner self when you went bananas.
21,1,0,You're no longer appealing to her.
39,12,9,Everything points to a split personality.
32,4,1,So you didn't like being referred to as "slippery?"
21,5,1,You have every right to feel "discarded"!
27,5,4,You're not the first banana I've had that feels on the inside they're really a plantain.
22,5,2,How long have you thought that you are a banana peel?
14,1,0,You have a classic case of Freudian slip.
29,6,5,Why do you let people to step all over you for laughs?
20,3,1,You talkin' to me?
34,5,0,No, that was the other kind of slip.
26,5,3,When that woman slipped, tell me how that made you feel.
19,2,1,So you and your wife split....
25,5,1,Your inner mind has devoured itself.
20,2,0,Good mental health is no accident.
26,11,2,About your feeling of emptiness inside...
13,0,0,I can see why you think going on is fruitless Mr. Dole.
27,4,4,Accidents happen; you aren't responsible for every slip and fall.
29,11,4,You feel like everyone steps all over you?
32,18,4,Everybody feels like garbage sometimes.
37,10,8,I just feel like I've lost who I am inside.
21,5,1,Yes, it is an unusually long time to remain in the phallic stage.
35,11,3,So tell me more about the split.
34,15,6,So when she left she took the best part of you?
20,6,0,When exactly did your obsession with Jerry Lewis begin?
19,3,1,Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
21,7,0,How long have you felt like you're 'missing something'?
16,1,0,And then I slipped up and called her by her mother's name.
20,2,1,Everyone slips up now and then.
21,5,1,And how did it make you feel. . . being tossed out on the sidewalk?
15,1,0,How can I step up when everybody's always stepping on me?
18,2,0,no,I don't think bananas are inferior to other fruit,Do you?
20,3,1,I don't think being transgender is going to matter with regard to fitting in.
22,0,3,We're here for you to peel back the layers. Don't bunch it all up inside.
18,2,0,Everything after "Here comes the bride" is a blur.
16,2,0,You need to get over being upset being a slapstick joke.
32,8,6,Do you want to slip on something more comfortable?
19,1,1,So how does it make you feel to always be the butt of the joke...?
26,6,3,Don't feel guilty--everyone slips up now and then.
26,9,3,How do you mean, "You feel like garbage?"
20,6,0,Nobody slips on me anymore
31,2,0,Okay, Mrs. Banane, I understand your concern about the slips, but worrying about "Yes, we have no bananas" is a bunch of catastrophizing.
25,8,1,You need to stop letting people step all over you.
19,2,0,I am telling you Doc, you are going to have to peel me off this couch.
30,7,5,It's natural to feel empty inside.
23,6,1,"So why do you think you're a banana peel?'
32,8,1,you're responsible for the slip, but not the fall.
19,4,0,Of course you don't like being stepped on. You're a banana peel.
22,6,1,We all have slips.
17,2,0,So you believe everyone is blaming you.
15,0,0,So the monkey ran away with the football?
36,10,8,So, was it a recent split?
16,1,0,...no I do not my phone number out after the first appointment .
17,3,0,And you're tired of getting blamed for all these accidents?
22,1,2,So tell me, how do you peel?
25,8,1,You're not an enabler, everyone has a slip now and then
32,17,5,So he took the best part of you and threw the rest away. How does that make you feel?
27,8,3,What do you mean, you've been looking at my slip?
29,9,3,Do you find yourself appealing.
21,0,0,Did you grow up in the middle?
41,4,0,So, you say you've never been the same since you woke up to find a tarantula in your crate?
19,3,1,Our time is up now. Please cleanup your string residue this time.
32,14,6,So it's not that people walk all over you...it's that they literally avoid you?
21,3,0,So you say you feel empty inside for some reason
15,0,0,I BELIEVE YOU LEFT YOUR SEAT-WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS ?
45,11,7,When did you first realize you were only skin deep?
20,7,0,Your guilt is from a Freudian slip.
15,0,0,Your body is nicer than me. How did you reduce the body fat percentage?
19,3,0,Did our foreplay make up for eating you?
22,3,2,But how do you feel when people walk on you?
17,3,0,I'am sure women think your apealing
26,10,5,Maybe making people slip and fall isn't for you. Have you considered composting?
20,4,0,I often feel like the punch line to a joke.
18,6,0,What do you mean "you slipped up"?
25,6,2,I always thought you looked like a slippery character
16,1,0,So, tell me how you're peeling?
21,1,2,So, you're afraid of slipping on a human.
22,6,1,It's not unusual for a patient to split when therapy becomes uncomfortable.
21,4,1,Most of my pals have split too.
27,3,3,So why are you tired of playing second banana?
17,0,0,I swear that watermelon ain't no kin of mine. We don't even look alike.
17,3,0,Once you accept the fact your a discard, you can move on.
17,1,0,Find you appealing?
23,6,2,How do you feel about the split?
22,1,2,When he ate you up and spit you out, how did that make you feel?
30,8,5,Not all slips are Freudian.
21,2,1,You're sure your bruises aren't from any sort of brawl or quarrel?
25,8,2,So she wanted a split?
21,3,2,And what makes you think you've lost your appeal?
33,14,6,I'm sorry to say it, but in your case you really are an accident waiting to happen.
26,7,3,So, what would make you think that you have a split personality?
30,8,4,Maybe a split is just what your relationship needs.
15,1,0,You say you were cast away by your original owner, but I guarantee you someone new will slip into your life.
18,3,0,I think you're showing early signs of PTSD
16,0,0,The first step in conquering inner emptiness is coming out from under the chaise.

45,22,11,Let's face the facts: you're spoiled rotten.
23,5,1,Why do you feel your life is slipping away?
16,1,0,So it sounds like your constant worry of being tread on in life has lead to your depression...How do you feel about that?
16,2,0,Quick, New Yorker, get some good cartoons or you're going to fold
28,9,2,How long have you been experiencing these feelings of emptiness?
28,9,3,Now really? A Freudian slip?
23,4,3,What makes you think people don't take you seriously?
23,8,1,Doctor- I feel so empty inside.
31,5,4,You knew going in a life in comedy wasn't easy.
21,5,1,No. I'm pretty sure Freud wouldn't have appreciated that kind of slip.
37,6,0,So you are saying you were a man before, right?
16,1,0,I'm sorry, that was too forward. My split personality is definitely getting worse.
16,1,0,You're saying the machete was a real thing?
17,1,0,Sometimes a banana is just a damn fine dessert ingredient.
20,3,1,Have you considered that this desire to watch me peel might be just a bit of transference?
32,11,4,She slipped. She fell. Get over it.
20,4,0,I feel unloved. Nobody slips on me anymore.
21,1,2,So you feel your partner doesn't have appeal?

17,1,0,Bi-polar? Banana split? Same difference.
18,1,1,Freudian slips are not your fault.
19,2,1,So why do you think people are always laughing at you?
16,1,0,No, Mr. Split, your case is actually less straightforward, and more, say, slippery.
21,2,1,Say more about your 'wish for revenge' when people step on you.
25,7,3,I think you are suffering from Plantain envy.
33,2,0,So your innermost fear is losing your purpose in life?
31,7,1,I'm better with the layers of an onion.
21,7,0,Tell me about when you first felt like a plantain.
27,13,2,So tell me why you feel you have a split personality?
29,8,4,It was a Freudian slip, I swear.
21,3,2,Why are all you macho guys called Chiquita?
22,1,1,Well, that's not exactly what Freudian slip means.
19,4,0,Let's set some ground rules right now -I will not tolerate slippery behavior.
26,9,3,When did you last feel like hurting someone?
24,7,3,Well, it all started when Carmen Miranda and I first met.

23,3,2,It's not your fault he slipped and on fell on you.
49,36,17,Something's been eating you. Tell me about it.
19,1,1,But he's a watermelon rind, Ms. Chiquita . You didn't think there'd be issues?
25,12,1,...And you feel that something is missing?
18,1,1,Confessions of an Ex-Vegan
31,8,5,...And what made you think it was a Freudian slip?
18,1,0,What happened to the balls you had when you began your analysis?
20,5,1,Tell me more about your Freudian slip.
20,3,1,I'am tired of giving everyone the slip
18,0,0,So tell me, when did you feel things were slipping?
22,7,1,So, your're afraid she'll dump you when she discovers that you're not really a plantain, just a plain old banana, banana peel at that? I'd be worried too.
19,1,1,Does your purpose in life make you happy, and if not, what's your biggest disappointment?
25,3,1,I'm sorry, but you sound like a nut.
17,4,0,As Freud said, sometimes a slip is just a slip.
19,1,1,Looking back, being neglected when I was young and green wasn't such a bad thing after all...
18,3,0,What if you can't find your birth tree?
21,9,1,Tell me about your family tree.
22,4,3,You must have felt very exposed.
23,4,2,You need to realize your own appeal and stop letting yourself always get stepped on in relationships.
17,1,0,So, when did the slide start?
19,1,1,"Penicillin" that's what I suggest.
30,16,3,We're making good progress peeling back the layers
23,5,2,Was it really that funny?
30,12,5,Maybe subconsciously I wanted him to slip and fall.
18,0,1,So, you feel empty inside – live with it.
38,7,2,I know, it’s a such cliché, but I’ve fallen over you…
15,0,0,I'm hearing you think your appeal is slipping?
21,5,1,So when did your partner split?
14,0,0,Why do you think that you continue to question whether to cause a slip or not to cause a slip?
32,6,7,You feel rejected because of the color of your skin?
52,21,19,I feel as if my whole life is like an accident just waiting to happen.
43,6,2,I've been doing it the wrong way my entire life.
20,6,0,Some people say I have appeal, but I feel so empty.
21,6,1,Everybody started falling for me after I lost all the weight.
26,6,3,And how does giving them the slip make you feel?
27,8,3,You slipped? You need to go back to rehab.
17,2,0,Special? No -- I'd say your anger's pedestrian.
23,9,2,No one falls for me anymore.
19,1,1,And how long have you been having these kinds of thoughts about sidewalks?
24,6,3,I tend to trip people up. I guess that's why they don't like me.
17,2,0,So how did it make you feel when the person slipped and fell
24,6,1,Let's revisit your relationship with your mother...the whipped cream, the red cherry. Sounds like a classic case of the Freudian Split.
21,10,1,...and when did you start peeling this way?
15,0,0,Thanks Doc, I'm back in the zone
21,3,0,WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU COULD BE PRESIDENT
29,0,0,Doctor, I love your legs, but your body language isn't helping me overcome the feelings of prejudice and discrimination we feel ever since those damned cartoonists began using us as an artistic device to represent slippery dog droppings.
36,13,8,What I put on my breakfast cereal isn't relevant to your therapy session, Mr. Cavendish.
20,1,0,No, "Banana Split" is not a condition listed in the DSM.
23,7,1,I sense there's something missing in your life.
30,0,2,Banana!
43,1,1,Your masochistic tendencies make you appealing for those who step all over you.
23,7,1,Our time's up. Please slip on out the side door.
16,1,0,To ease your depression you have to keep reminding yourself that you are the top.
29,12,4,I'm glad to see you finally open up.
28,10,6,We don't want you slipping back into bad behavior
27,11,4,I see why you feel so empty inside.
19,1,1,I'm really not comfortable with you sitting there judging me for how I use your better half.
25,4,2,'Me thinned skin, I doubt it. You're the one on the couch."
15,1,0,You have very similar features to a vase I'm treating for anxiety.
20,7,0,But when they say they slipped on you, maybe it's just a metaphor.
22,7,1,At some point you'll have to get a grip.
13,0,0,I know the extra competition is stressful, but it's only once every four years.
28,10,4,It appears you have a split personality.
20,2,1,So, you're here to resolve your anxiety about "one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel"?
16,3,0,What's got you split three ways?
22,7,1,You're making progress but your slipping a little
18,3,0,This is complex; I'll have to unpeel several layers of your personality.
19,3,0,I think you should get in touch with your inner self.
15,6,0,Despite your loss, let's not minimize your worth as an excellent source of dietary fiber and potassium.
39,22,9,So you feel your life’s now fruitless?
17,4,0,I'd go to a 12-step meeting, but everyone blames me for slipping.
31,13,3,When did you get dumped by Apple?
34,12,7,I used to be the top banana now everyone treats me like trash.
17,5,0,So you feel that people are avoiding you.
18,4,0,Really, size doesn't matter
18,2,0,So now you're a Banana Democrat?
38,16,7,Well? What's eating you?
23,10,1,"It's not your fault people keep falling for you".
30,6,1,Why do you think you feel so empty?
18,1,2,Your slip is showing.
17,2,0,You are appealing, yet others avoid you. How does that make you feel?
15,0,0,It all started when me and my boyfriend broke-up. Thus the creation of banana split.
13,0,0,Oh no, I tried to draw a gorilla... But it ran
21,7,1,I just feel used.
15,0,0,Your plans for office, realistically show lack in your peel.
26,4,3,You say they stepped all over you, how did you feel about that?
15,0,0,Is your need to make people slip and break their necks a subliminal desire to get back at your mother? I don’t know – you tell me.
36,13,8,Should I bill Dole or Chiquita for your therapy?
33,9,7,And then she added sprinkles..
34,18,5,People slip and fall for lots of reasons; you've got to stop blaming yourself.
33,9,5,Why do you feel you're life's one big joke?
34,6,3,Your rationalizations are a slippery slope.
18,0,1,Tell me about your childhood. How many siblings were in your cluster?
17,2,0,Now then, tell me, do you remember when this feeling of total uselessness started?
16,0,0,I bet he thinks he's worth two of us.
18,2,0,When do you think that you started to let things slip?
41,8,1,And how did Freud slipping on you make you peel?
25,9,2,So, why don't you tell me about the split?
14,1,0,You shouldn't feel guilty. Jason brought the banana peel challenge upon himself.
16,2,0,Not as slippery as you think.
18,3,0,Everything with you is subconscious.
25,5,3,At least you're not another fruitcake.
19,3,0,So it sounds like what you're trying to say is that you don't want to let this relationship slip away like the last few did.
25,9,2,tell me more about this feeling of emptiness inside...
18,2,1,So, I guess making people slip was a way to get positive attention.
17,0,0,You're feeling hollow since your heart and soul left you for another?
20,1,1,So tell me when it all started to fall apart.
26,2,4,Tell me, how does that make you peel?
20,4,1,Gotta be a split personality. I'd bet a month of sundaes on it.
20,7,0,I'd like us to focus on your early relationship with the bunch.
20,7,1,I'm sure it was just a Freudian slip.
24,5,2,I don't know if I should help you or compost you.
18,4,0,And how exactly did that make you peel?
20,7,0,I think this is a classic case of splitting.
28,7,4,It's ok, it was just a Freudian slip.
34,2,0,So you have come here because things have been slipping your mind lately, yes?
24,5,0,Your appeal is slipping? How does that make you feel?
14,0,0,Body language 101: Legs crossed AWAY is a sure sign of low a-peel.
23,6,1,So after the baby, he split?
16,0,0,Damn Banana, were you made by Sam the banana man.
14,1,0,So when were your first thoughts about this murder - suicide plan?
22,6,1,Your mood issues might be caused by a potassium deficiency.
30,8,5,Seriously?
18,0,1,Do I find you attractive? Why, you are appeal itself!
20,7,0,Again, I apologize... But surely can understand why someone might titter when you say you have a 'bunch' of problems.
38,11,2,No, I don't think you're all peel and no banana.
19,2,1,So tell me, why did you split?
31,13,4,What exactly do you mean by "empty inside"?
38,3,1,Studies indicate that an early traumatic peeling can cause low self esteem in later years.
19,5,0,"People stepping all over me is no joke".
26,3,2,We're going to try something new today.
25,3,4,It's a classic case of a split personality.
20,5,1,OK, let's peel back another layer.
20,0,2,What's wrong, you're usually happy to see me.
43,24,10,Doesn't it feel better to open up?
29,10,4,Maybe slapstick just isn't funny anymore.
18,2,0,Your family was a bad bunch, but you're appealing.
15,0,0,Just ignore them. I find your puns appealing.
24,9,1,When did you first discover you were accident prone?
15,0,0,What happened to your little pee pee?
15,0,0,So what's so funny about my slip?
25,9,2,No, I don't think all those slips were Freudian.
22,7,1,It would be unethical for me to acknowledge your appeal.
26,3,2,Besides feeling empty , what else is troubling you?
24,3,3,So how long ago did Carmen leave you?
26,7,1,Tell me more about this emptiness you've been feeling.
17,2,0,I'm tired of everyone telling me I peel my clothes off like a banana!
27,13,1,And why do you think that was a Freudian slip?
25,9,2,And how does the split make you peel?
31,7,6,Well maybe you should try Standup>
35,9,8,I just can't shake this feeling that people are avoiding me.
19,5,1,It's only Freudian if you subconsciously wanted them to slip.
21,0,2,You're more than a cheap laugh. You're a slightly below average protective shell
16,1,0,Your guilt about all the harm that you've caused in the past is preventing you from moving forward.
23,13,0,Based on what you told me about your mother, I'm afraid you've got what we call an edible complex.
34,3,0,I peeled first, now you.
15,1,0,How did you feel when your wife said you had lost your appeal?
27,2,1,I didn't think you would take "penis envy" personally.
17,4,0,Where do you think this emptiness inside originates?
30,4,1,...So you say you're always being stepped on?
32,10,6,You say your parents were eaten by chimpanzees?
30,5,5,How should I feel? People just rip out my insides and throw me aside!
17,2,0,Mrs. Peel ran off with Steed?
23,3,2,I'm tired of people stepping on me.
17,0,0,The good news is that we've identified your objet (petit) a...
24,2,3,There better not be a banana in my tailpipe.
22,5,1,And when he slipped on you, Nan, how did it make you peel?
23,9,1,It's a clear case of split personality.
19,3,1,Why do you feel being unpeeled makes you unappealing?
17,2,0,I've been slipping up at work a bunch lately. I'm worried I'm losing my appeal.
24,10,1,Yes, Freud slipped here.
17,2,0,It's NOT funny when people slip on me. It hurts!
20,5,0,Did your fear of being composted start before or after peeling?
17,2,0,Yes, you're spineless, Deirdre, but that doesn't mean you lack the courage to look deep inside yourself.
23,6,2,You let people walk over you once and it's a slippery slope!
29,10,4,Have you had these empty feelings before?
20,3,1,No, no, I said that was a Freudian slip!
25,9,2,Why do you feel like the world is waiting for you to slip up?
19,4,0,Now, let's tak about your split
31,11,5,I don’t think the banana is coming back.
17,2,0,Well, I'm prescribing Viagra.
17,1,1,The term is parentified child, Karl.
18,4,0,Appeal comes in MANY ways.
15,2,0,Now I just feel so empty. It's a slippery slope.
17,3,0,So you feel rejected?
38,9,2,One Freudian slip, and they're going to blame it on you.
37,8,1,It's perfectly normal to be upset. No one in your condition would want to be called a plantain.
15,0,0,you feel no one takes you seriously
35,2,7,"Ate" is such a strong word.
18,4,0,So, he gave you the "slip", huh? The dirty plantain.
12,0,0,So, what made you think you might be becoming an ape?
20,2,1,Can you tell me more about your appeal?
42,16,10,You've got to forgive yourself . . . don't forget, he also had one foot in the grave . . .
13,1,0,You're starting to appeal to me.
17,3,0,I don't care about your planet, here you are just a seed pod.
190,319,235,I have to ask, do you feel that you could be a danger to others?
48,6,1,Does it bother you that people think you're bananas?
18,4,0,When did you realize you had a compulsion to cause people to slip and fall?
16,2,0,And why do YOU think your always under foot?
18,2,1,The feelings of losing your inner self are compensated by your appeal.
21,2,2,So tell me more about Daiquiri.
17,3,0,After which you suffer from uncontrollable hysterics?
34,19,6,That's just the low potassium level talking.
36,8,7,I suppose that was a breach of the physician-patient relationship.
32,14,5,And when did you first start having these thoughts - that you'll wind up on the street?
43,21,11,You mustn't blame yourself for other people's slip-ups.
20,2,1,So, why do you think that you don't have appeal?
25,7,2,Let's explore "I feel empty inside".
19,1,1,Miss Peel, how long have you been under the impression that you are a ballerina?
17,2,0,Tell me what happened after you peeled off from the bunch.
22,5,1,Yes but let's focus on your appeal.
28,12,2,I have a lot of patients with a split personality
30,11,4,I understand your frustration but you're a comedic icon and the transition to drama will be a challenge.
16,1,0,So what makes you think you're so unappeeling?
16,1,0,So you played 'monkey, panda, banana' once in college. That doesn't define you.
23,13,0,It's evident to me that your problems are more than skin deep.
36,15,7,Ah, I see. And how did that make you peel?
15,0,0,To be so open . . . such a-peel!
22,6,1,You've got five seconds to get that banana back in the peel.
21,4,1,I feel like I'm slipping in and out of reality.
21,5,0,Kafka or not, the answer is still no.
34,4,2,So what's troubling you Mr. Banana? You seem so relaxed.
13,0,0,I lost my self-confidence after I slipped on a banana peel
32,7,6,You're turning black. Our session time is up.
17,1,0,When did you first realize that you enjoyed hurting people?
19,3,1,Doctor, I need help. I split on my wife.
20,1,0,Skin treatment.
33,1,0,You dreamed the Banana Skins played the Redskins and I'm Cheerleading?
18,3,1,Sometimes I feel like all skin and no substance.
36,10,8,When did you first know you are actually a starfish?
24,9,2,I get the feeling everyone's trying to avoid me.
18,2,0,Wouldn't you rather consult a Freudian analyst?
18,5,0,Actually 'sex appeal' doesn't mean that.
26,6,2,Yes, I promise, no Freudian slip jokes.
14,1,0,Did you mean to say that, or was that a Freudian you-know-what?
20,6,0,We got into a big argument, and than she split.
22,2,0,I live in fear that someone will slip on me.
43,18,10,How are things since the split?
15,1,0,Superficial? Thin-skinned? Say more…
21,7,0,Let's try something you may find more appealing.
26,7,2,You need to take these sessions more seriously.
21,4,0,Wow, this is the first time a patient has literally eaten their heart out!
23,5,2,Yes, you remain appealing.
18,1,1,So tell me about the first time you started to peel?
26,6,3,I would call it a Freudian slip.
20,2,1,Do others find you appealing?
22,5,1,' I just feel so empty on the inside you know..'
19,5,0,Okay,I get it, I get it. You slipped up badly. But how do you feel now.
15,0,0,He called me Chiquita then forced his fingers inside me.
18,3,0,It may all seem fruitless now, but be careful not to slide down that slippery slope.
19,2,1,Well they shouldn't have walked over me in the first place.
18,3,0,Yes, other fruit. ANY other fruit. Do you think I'm crazy?
21,5,1,... and in what way did you used to be funny?
27,8,5,I understand you were involved in a sidewalk tragedy?
33,6,2,Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping from reality.
24,7,3,I can see why you feel nothing inside.
20,1,2,Don't you ever try to slip up on me like that again!
22,3,2,It could very well be that people keep giving you the slip because you're just too appealing!
15,1,0,I've got potential!
17,0,1,May I call you Lily?
18,2,0,Don't think of yourself as garbage. Remember it's what's on the inside that counts.
35,7,1,Give up the guilt. It wasn't your fault.
17,3,0,And that's when she told me she wanted a banana split
25,4,2,What do YOU think a 60-year-old Austrian psychoanalyst in your dreams means?
19,0,0,For starters, shame is quite different from guilt.
33,8,0,Okay, so why is it that you don't consider yourself very appealing?
20,0,2,Peelings are flippery sthings.
22,6,1,Trust me, you are a peeling!
16,1,0,Right, so the banana peel identity is the comedian and the banana is the sex object?
23,9,1,Sure people are falling for you, but I don't think it's your magnetic personality."
19,3,0,You seem to be perking up a bit.
18,4,0,So, you failed at becoming completely at one with your favorite ice cream?
15,0,0,It would be a real "slip" up if we had a cartoon contest that wasn't set in a therapy session!
37,23,9,You've been hanging with the wrong bunch.
33,22,4,You may be suffering from separation anxiety.
18,2,0,What do mean your grasp of reality is slipping?
18,2,0,Give up puns? I appeal to you.
20,7,0,I can't take it anymore. I was organic before organic was cool. I almost had a run-in with kale last night. I used to be top dog for everyone's smoothie.
22,6,1,So, you're tired of being constantly cast aside.
19,2,1,guilt guilt guilt Did you ever think of how many people didn't slip?
16,0,0,Your lucky, that was close!
18,4,0,Your problems are a slippery slope.
27,3,4,And when they are laughing, how does that make you feel?
18,3,0,I'm just so sick of always being depicted as some hazard.
24,6,2,Can you tell me when these feelings of emptiness began?
43,23,12,You've got to stop letting people walk all over you.
26,2,4,It's common to fall for your analyst.
55,9,2,Describe your feelings after she slipped and fell.
21,2,1,You had a refrigerator for a mother...
24,6,2,You shouldn't blame yourself for all the slip ups.
25,9,2,Perhaps your low potassium is causing your depression.
21,7,1,I just want someone who won't walk all over me.
18,3,0,These feelings of guilt, you say the person slipped while texting?
15,0,0,I'm going bananas. Everyones hurting my peelings now because I'm too sugary!
21,5,1,Excuse me, but it's MY job to peel back the layers
18,2,0,And, you say since the penectomy, you've been feeling empty inside?
14,0,0,So you feel hollow, useless, and an impending sense of doom?
23,5,2,You can't appeal to everyone.
15,0,0,I don't think this is a good time to step it up
18,3,0,You seem to be lacking substance.
19,1,1,Yes just a cigar, just a banana, and just a banana peel.
19,3,1,My professional opinion is that you're giving me the 'slip'.
26,5,3,You said you are not a peeling?
17,3,0,It's been almost two months since my last slip, but I am feeling optimistic about this week.
22,8,1,That's what we call a Freudian slip
21,12,0,Have you ever tried going for a laugh that wasn't at somebody else's expense?
15,0,0,You shouldn't feel guilty that his leg was broken
17,4,0,Today I'd like to focus on your feelings of abandonment.
21,4,1,I'm afraid we don't accept patients on the Dole
21,1,2,Yes, what's inside is what matters most. That's why I ate it.
21,4,1,Tell me more about your feeling of emptiness.
15,0,0,Just because you feel like a fish out of water doesn't necessarily mean you're squidzophrenic.
26,7,3,Lately i've just felt empty inside...
17,4,0,And how long have you been feeling like you aren't taken seriously?
15,0,0,You have to take responsibility; that wasn't a Freudian slip!
15,0,0,Carrie Bradshaw I'm not!
20,3,1,Tell me, using only positive phrases, the secret to your appeal
17,3,0,I'm sure she finds you a-peeling.
16,2,0,At times I feel you don't tell me what I need to know
16,1,0,My recurring nightmare is a 500 pound man in a hurry crossing my path.
26,6,3,And how does it make YOU feel that he slipped and broke his neck?
21,5,1,It's just a Freudian slip; let's move on.
33,3,0,The last time I saw Olive was in a salad.
18,4,0,And what makes you think I'm going to fall for you?
16,1,0,I had no chance against the banana split.
15,3,0,And, you know, it's a slippery slope from there.
28,3,4,And then the ice cream up and split.
17,0,0,"Mr. Peel you suffer from classic abandonment issue's".
16,1,0,When he used your insides for a smoothie, how did that make you feel?
15,3,0,You got hungry!?
14,0,0,Did you say "Alabama"?
22,6,1,Why do you think you cause so many others to slip up?
28,10,3,Your feeling of emptiness could be related to a bunch of issues
18,0,1,As a clone, your sexual stages are limited.
23,2,0,I feel that I can't control my slippery relationship with people.
26,11,3,Every day is just another accident waiting to happen.
23,10,1,You can split, but you paid for the full hour.
25,9,3,But seriously, how does that make you peel?
40,18,10,So, yes, you have no banana. But how does that make you feel?
21,5,1,Causing pratfalls is an attempt to compensate for your impotence.
42,11,3,Sorry Mr. Cavendish, I don't usually eat my clients, but I skipped lunch.
28,8,2,Feeling empty is only natural, but do try to stay off of sidewalks.
16,0,0,So you feel empty, being replaced by the big cheese?
21,1,2,I understand you're feeling empty inside.
15,0,0,It all started when i was born an open banana.
26,6,2,Tell me about the clowns again.
17,4,1,Now i'm thinking the split was a good thing...
18,4,0,Because you've been peeled and your innards used for a smoothie, it would be prudent to increase your Prozac dosage significantly for the foreseeable future.
19,2,1,And tell me–how did that make you peel?
19,3,2,Yes, you do have a remarkable ability to become whatever you want to be. Nevertheless, until the Supreme Court reverses its decision, let's stick with what's on your birth certificate.
26,5,3,So how long have you felt you're a public menace?
15,1,0,He's such a showoff
26,13,2,I'm not surprised that you feel empty inside.
19,3,0,And why did that appeal to you?
21,4,1,It wasn't your fault somebody slipped on you.
26,7,3,It's not your fault that they don't watch where they're walking.
37,16,7,What about moving from comedy to personal injury?
25,7,2,Is the idea of someone slipping and falling appealing to you?
16,1,0,Is it wrong that I find you appealing?
18,1,0,Do you thikn you're a banana peel?
13,0,1,Let's start with why you think everyone blames you.
17,2,0,Stop treating yourself like outdated gag.
19,0,1,For my whole life I couldn't identify being a banana. Now with your help Doctor I can tell the world I'm a Pineapple!.
21,4,1,Banana Who
17,1,0,So how did it feel when you were kicked out of "The Wild Bunch?
14,0,0,Why do you think she just slipped away?
22,6,1,Yes, I guess you're appealing in an organic sort of way.
14,1,0,I knew some of my patients would be fruity, but this is a bit much.
15,0,0,and then you slipped... i see, tell me more...
18,1,0,You say this chimpanzee pinched you hard on the nose, and then devoured your guts?
25,4,2,I sense your slipping away from me.
17,2,0,Sit back. Relax. You're getting very slippery.
37,4,1,I'm sure someone out there will find you aPEELing...
34,7,1,And you say that's when you started to feel things were slipping?
17,2,0,I get it... you feel like an empty peel with no appeal.
19,2,1,You’re just feeling vulnerable right now.
18,4,0,Yes, Mr. Cavendish, and how long has this "Fusarium wilt" nightmare been troubling you?
28,7,4,I can just feel my life slipping away
25,6,3,He did that and then cast you aside?
30,6,2,So talk to me about why you believe people fall on you all the time.
32,11,5,So you've been having a hard time since the split?
27,9,1,And why do you think you don't feel complete?
21,5,0,I also run a support group for abandoned rinds, shells, and pea pods.
16,1,0,Have you considered resting in places where people *won't* slip on you?
19,5,0,Relax and you'll peel better.
18,3,0,I understand that he fell, but I really think you're missing what 'Freudian' means.
24,13,1,When did your fear of monkeys begin?
48,9,4,But there can only be ONE top banana!
26,11,2,So you were never the same after the split?
31,5,1,And you say the witch doctor became angry ?
11,1,0,Are you a banana, or are you happy to see me?
24,9,1,We all slip up sometimes
16,1,0,They blame me but it's Freudian...
28,5,1,How long have you felt everything around you was slipping ?
23,1,2,What do you mean my slip is showing?
31,24,9,No offense, I am thick skinned
22,3,2,It all started when my parents split
16,1,0,It sounds like another pyramid scheme.
18,3,0,Should I man up and just split?
19,2,0,My family is splitting apart!
16,0,0,I told you before, a doctor patient relationship has to remain professional.
22,2,2,I don't think she meant to say your existence was banal.
17,2,0,Peeling away ... how did it feel .
16,1,0,How long have you had this fear that if you let your guard down then you will be peeled and eaten?
16,1,0,- Hard-core drug addiction, edible overdoses, Monsanto poisonings . . . - It's not your fault, it's not your fault
23,5,2,And so then the banana split?
17,0,1,Did you say, 'squeeze me?'
17,2,0,No kidding! You're really going bananas?
20,1,1,I think you need to stop that diet.
35,16,8,Yes, it is what's on the inside that counts.
16,0,0,As I see it, your worries about losing your position in the comedy business are just part of your overall fear of failure. Maybe all you need is to get a better straight-man.
25,7,2,Do you think your identification as a cheap comic device could be a source of your self-worth issues?
22,9,0,When we peel back the layers you'll realize you're not to blame for others fallings.
22,4,2,I'm in a love triangle with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.
36,1,1,Exactly when was the last time you had a bite?

19,3,0,Being the second banana is okay. As long as you're not the third.
27,5,3,No, therapy is not a slippery slope.
17,4,0,And just how long have you felt fruity?
16,1,0,I see an underlying cause for your performance anxiety.
19,1,0,you have to stop obsessing over banana splits
29,10,4,So Steve Jobs picked the apple instead, and it's been downhill for me ever since.
22,7,1,So, you're always getting stepped on.
15,1,0,When did you first notice this complex with onions?
26,8,4,We call it a banana split personality disorder.
21,2,0,Soo... what say we slip you outta that dress?
26,8,2,So your saying it was a Freudian slip
27,4,1,I think you took my suggestion to try to be more appealing a little too literally.
27,5,4,Sure people blame you too much for their falls, but I am sensing some real guilt here, too.
18,4,0,Pratfall dependency is more common than you think.
23,12,0,Tell me more about feeling discarded.
35,12,6,What does it really mean to not be comfortable in your own skin

45,30,11,So, you and ice cream. Tell me about the split.
21,8,0,It appears that therapy has gotten under your skin.
36,10,6,We all sometimes feel like our lives are a joke.
20,2,1,You realize, of course, I can never do that again.
17,5,1,That's what is known as a Freudian slip.
19,2,0,So tell me how you think your mind is slipping.
18,3,0,We knew that when you began the gender reassignment it was going to be s slippery slope!
23,5,2,So, you just split?
33,12,6,Let's not go there, it's a slippery slope.
25,8,2,Would you say you've grown a thicker skin after the split?
19,1,1,You shouldn't let people put you down in the first place.
34,9,9,Since the split, my life has been a total joke.
22,5,2,Let's start at the beginning when you fell out of the tree
25,4,3,So, tell me more about your obsession with abruptly bring people down to your level.
23,8,2,Yes, I agree that it was a slip, but are you sure it was Freudian?
22,5,0,Doc...I'm just not peeling very well lately
34,18,4,And how long have you felt like you've had a split personality?
16,1,0,Believe me, it's no use crying over spilled milk.
41,13,11,What you're experiencing is called compost-traumatic stress disorder.
25,6,2,So you were deserted for ice cream, syrup, and whipped cream. You still have appeal.
18,3,0,Sorry, the doctor - patient relationship prevents me from "Slipping the Light Fantastic" with you.
17,0,0,You sell a bit ripe.
27,5,3,I feel like people are always stepping on me
28,4,5,Let's talk about the split
18,4,0,Say more about losing your sense of purpose.
31,8,4,You silly doofus, the fruit flies really ARE after you.
41,4,1,Looks like your past life regression therapy was a huge success.
20,7,0,It's separation anxiety. But you still have appeal.
14,0,0,Sometimes you peel open, other times you just split.
20,3,1,Charlie Chaplin's whole career was defined by silent, physical humor, and he is a comedy legend.
15,0,0,So there was no money in the banana stand for you? Only terror?
25,1,4,Sounds like you've been slipping up.
28,1,0,I'm an empty shell of the man I once was.
22,7,1,Well most of my patients ARE fruits!
22,6,1,So, you think your slipping and something inside you is missing?
21,5,1,Why do you feel its not easy being green?
18,4,0,We need to connect you with your inner-self.
24,9,4,Everybody has a fear of composting.
37,11,3,Did you ever consider that it might not always be the slope that is slippery?
25,2,3,How dare you suggest I slip into something more comfortable!
15,1,0,Yes, you're a peel, but you have appeal.
18,1,1,I've been empty inside since the split
25,5,2,I'm suspecting a potassium deficiency.
20,6,0,So you would say that leaving the others in the bunch was liberating at first, right?
28,10,3,Your friendship with the monkey was bound to end in betrayal and a profound sense of loss.
20,3,1,Sounds to me like a Freudian slip.
26,4,0,Honest, doc, it's gonna take a bunch to peal back what slipped me up years ago.
46,3,1,Help me, Doctor! I just hate making people slip and fall but I always have such a strong inner compulsion to do it!
21,5,1,i guess you slipped up when you split...
20,4,1,So, let's explore why you enjoy watching people slip.
25,6,1,And why do you feel your life is just a big joke?

17,0,0,Very sneaky...you almost got your therapist to slip and tell you what I'm thinking
18,2,0,I told you it's the inner you that really matters.
34,9,5,You feel stepped on?
27,9,5,Why do you feel that people are avoiding you?
29,5,5,I don't think appeal is what you're lacking.
21,4,0,Would you consider yourself passive aggressive?
30,7,6,No, Mr. Denham, I will not call you 'Kong,' and please come down from the bookcase.
23,3,3,Sorry, did you say you had a close relationship with your Nana?
18,3,0," Then she said 'I would be just as appealing .'
19,5,0,I hope you don't mind. I worked through lunch.
27,9,3,You're a piece of inedible garbage, deal with it
31,14,5,You're low sense of self-esteem stems from the fact that you really are garbage.
20,3,1,No one takes me seriously either!
17,1,1,Why do you feel it was Freudian?
18,3,0,I sense a feeling of emptiness and a loss of bananahood
27,4,3,What does 'produce' mean to you?
17,2,0,I don't think they necessarily want to walk all over you anymore...
20,0,1,I made like a banana.
29,8,5,And how does it make you feel when people cautiously step around?
29,4,4,No, I am not going to slip into something more comfortable.
24,8,0,I know how you peel.
22,5,1,And did you begin to experience these feelings of depression when you realized that you were never going to be top banana?
21,5,1,'' But Nana, tell me why you feel so empty.''
26,6,3,So you think you've lost your banana.
27,10,3,So why is it so important to be the top banana?
24,1,1,Didn't I slip on you last week?
25,7,2,Let's get to the bottom of your split.
23,6,2,It was a bad split.
24,2,3,Now that my appearance has changed...I don't know which bathroom to use ?
35,6,1,Whether you were ripe enough is something we'll need to work on.
44,14,8,Try not to think of it as another fruitless therapy session.
20,3,1,That's a very slippery slope!
43,30,12,You need to stop seeing yourself as the fall guy.
33,7,5,I feel like everyone is avoiding me.
36,14,7,I believe you're suffering from separation anxiety.
18,2,0,And have you thought about reaching out to that snooty waiter with the full tray?
16,1,0,How long have you been feeling that you've been used ?
21,5,0,So you're saying the banana split.
36,6,2,The monkeys are just tearing my family apart.
15,0,0,Ah, you think Xanax works better than talk therapy to reduce feelings of emptiness.
17,3,0,What's the icda 10 code for this visit?
38,5,1,When did you first notice that you feel like a sight gag?
27,10,2,Tell me about your childhood, Chiquita
18,4,0,Tell me more about feeling you have lost your core essence.
21,1,2,People are always giving me the slip.
45,2,0,Um, so I have "a friend" who's in love with his therapist, he just thinks she might be a little crazy...
19,3,0,So, every time someone picks you, you feel the need to split?
20,3,1,At what age did you discover you're a peel?
26,7,3,What's your secret for mastering the splits? It's very appealing.
29,2,1,Let's talk about a time when you fell down.
21,3,1,i wish they saw that I was beautiful on the outside too.
16,2,0,I just cant keep people around, they all just slip away.
22,5,1,How long has it been since you "went bananas?"
20,7,0,Do you think your need to joke about "Freudian slips" may be masking something deeper?
15,0,0,A dream about being stepped on doesn’t mean you are having feelings of being inferior.
33,8,0,I feel like the entire world is just stepping all over me
15,0,0,So, you just feel slippery all over?
23,1,0,Anyone who would turn himself into a banana peel is clearly nuts!
16,1,0,"My professional opinion? You're bananas".
45,28,12,Maybe you don't have an inferiority complex. Maybe you really are an accident waiting to happen.
21,10,1,I feel like I'm a harm to myself and others.
21,1,1,Don't give me the slip!
39,3,0,You're worried about your a peel.
21,5,1,Hmm, I doubt whipped cream and a cherry would fill that empty feeling for long.
18,2,0,You were hanging with your friends, went home to Lorena, then what?
16,2,1,And why do you... feel guilty... when you didn't initiate the mishap?
23,4,2,And how does it feel to no longer be a phallic symbol?
23,9,1,So how long since you split?
24,5,1,So you tripped him. Then what?
20,1,1,It's not your fault you were the banana peel his one foot was on.
24,6,2,So, what would you say triggered this feeling of complete emptiness?
23,10,2,I feel my life is just slipping away.
28,8,0,And then she swallowed me whole
28,6,4,Of course you feel stepped on.
27,5,4,I'm afraid I'm not as appealing as I once was.
25,6,3,...and, yes, sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel.
22,8,1,Life hasn't been the same since the split
23,10,0,O.K., so you gave him the slip. What happened next?
173,181,137,Would you feel more comfortable on the floor ?
18,4,0,We may have some trouble finding the root of your problem.
26,12,2,When I said I found you appealing, it was just a Freudian slip.
25,2,0,And how do you feel when people slip?
25,5,3,Feeling "stepped-on" is common, but aren't you being a bit dramatic?
14,0,0,It was a joke. Slippery slope? I really think you should reconsider joining our compost support group.
16,1,0,How long have you had this slipping fetish?
22,6,1,We've gone over this before. Elvis was a drug addict. You have to stop blaming yourself.
19,2,0,I heard you the first time and it wasn't funny then either.
21,1,2,So I'm hearing that you feel empty and think you may be headed for a slip.
19,5,0,I think you're slipping.
20,6,1,One more Freudian slip and you will have to find another therapist, ok?
16,0,1,No! I never date a patient!
15,0,0,So your great grandmother caused his first one?
18,3,0,I know I've been in this business too long when I start answering your questions!
28,5,3,Where did I slip up, Doc?
19,1,1,you must learn to not blame yourself for the death.
18,0,0,Tricky tentacles? I'll just take your word for it.
16,1,0,It's nothing to worry about. Stalking is part of your nature.
19,5,1,So, how does it feel to fall for someone else?
19,3,1,Most people go through life without slipping on me even once. So why does everyone treat me like I'm a piece of garbage?
28,6,4,Tell me more about the day your parents split.
31,7,6,How do you really peel?
23,4,2,I think you'd be happier with a Freudian analyst.
27,8,3,I suggest a cat…monkeys are trouble.
21,4,1,It's time for a change. You're empty inside. Your words are slippery; your behavior's rotten.
15,1,0,That's good. So how long have you had this empty feeling?
20,2,2,I've got news for you. Sometimes a slip is just a slip.
16,0,0,My son's caption for last week's bird on gun barrel cartoon (it's from Lord Of the Rings) "Like they say, the closer we are to danger the farther we are from harm." My issue yesterday, late but I wanted to share his suggestion.
25,5,3,So, why don't you think it was an accident?
32,12,6,It sounds like you yearn for someone to fall for you, and fall hard.
20,6,0,And how does that make you feel when someone steps on you?
17,1,0,Last week you said it felt like everyone you love is slipping away.
18,3,0,It doesn't matter if you're not mentioned first, you're still an integral part of the sandwich.
21,5,1,Tough skin, but empty inside. You remind me of my ex.
40,12,11,Sure you have issues but I'm the one talking to a banana peel.
15,0,0,Well, I'm more than JUST glad to see you.
33,4,2,Tell me about your last slip.
18,3,0,You want to peel what?
34,13,5,An orange referred you to me?
30,8,5,So you're depressed because you're not the top banana anymore?
17,2,0,Im not gonna let this one slip away...he is quite appealing
17,1,0,Are you familiar with the term "castration anxiety?"
16,0,0,No, no, I said you have a three-STAGE condition.
26,11,2,So tell me when this feeling of emptiness began.
29,5,4,It feels like I'm empty inside.
23,9,1,I believe that you believe you're a banana peel.
34,9,5,Ever since he left I feel empty inside.
34,36,1,Tell me about your separation from the bunch.
16,1,0,This is getting expensive, she split on me again!
19,2,0,Banana Splits?, hmmm.
17,4,0,Most definitely, you have a banana split personality.
31,15,4,No, Robert, I asked you to show me how you FEEL.
18,1,1,Leaving the sidewalks to join the circus could make you more appeeling
27,12,2,It's a textbook case of banana split personality.
28,4,6,Let's try to envision a solution rather than fixating on penis envy.
18,4,0,So what exactly are we this week?
21,4,1,So I presume you need help with the recent split?
18,3,0,How long have you had this feeling of being a mere shell of your former self?
21,4,1,Gretta, life isn't always going to be vitamins C, B-6 and potassium.
23,7,2,I'm going to help you find your inner self
17,2,0,just slip into something more comfortable
26,10,2,It seems like every guy I meet ends up falling for me...
18,4,0,Besides the hygiene issues, my code of ethics prohibits a relationship.
16,1,0,That's a really slippery attitude.
23,1,3,You need to let go of Curious George and get on with your life.
26,7,3,My fear of death intensified with the appearance of brown spots.
28,5,3,So you're saying you feel as if your whole life has been a Freudian slip.
20,3,1,I would not go down that slippery slope, if I were you!
18,2,0,I've had patients without appeal, but never a peel without patience.
20,1,2,Tell me how that makes you peel.
22,3,2,No one said life is a bowl of bananas.
22,2,2,I'm worried I'm going to start slipping again.
43,3,0,So tell me, what did she do to you?
17,0,0,You can keep your opinion about Beyonce's new album to yourself. Not everything is about you.
21,2,2,Don't tell me you've slipped again
17,1,0,You want to tell me about your "slip and fall".
16,1,0,The dysfunction's treatable, no problem. Can't help you with the empty feeling, though.
26,2,5,My parents were both fostered.
18,0,1,Hey, a banana!
22,3,1,I just want to feel respected. People walk all over me like I'm not even there!
40,10,3,Let's re-visit your cereal and milk obsession.
17,1,0,Cheer up! There's always slapstick.
26,5,1,Okay, Chiquita, what did you do to make them put you in the refrigerator?
21,1,2,YOU HAVE TO GET OVER THIS IDEA THAT YOUR SLIPPING.

18,3,0,How long have you had nightmares about flying monkeys?
31,10,5,I'm not so sure that bananopause is a real thing.
19,2,1,Try to adapt to the Big Apple.
31,15,4,Might it have been a Freudian slip?
23,4,1,While I'm certainly flattered, our canons of ethics prohibit any non-professional patient involvement.
23,7,1,So you're saying you felt used?
28,3,5,Well, that was highly unethical, but I needed that. I do often get hangry during these sessions.
15,0,0,Mrs. Banana didn't find me apeeling. We split.
17,0,0,That's your third slip this session!
17,2,0,Oh please! Not the old Freudian slip thing again!
19,4,0,I understand that you feel used. It's a symptom of your split personality.
19,4,0,I don't know why I feel this way; I just feel all used up.
21,3,2,I'm just here to peel away at the edges of the story.
22,8,2,Say it.."I'm a fruit." Doesn't that feel good?
24,3,3,Do you think all women find you appealing?
40,15,8,We've all had a few slip-ups!
23,6,2,Yes, I know a cigar is just a cigar.
20,3,0,"When did you decide you wanted to be a plaintain"?
23,13,0,Whether I find you appealing is beside the point
17,4,0,Orange you glad I didn't ask you how you feel?
28,2,0,Believe me when I tell you, you're just plain nuts.
28,12,3,I know it may not seem it now, but you are more than just these peelings.
22,6,1,We were a fun bunch, now I feel totally ripped off and discarded.
63,38,22,You are an accident waiting to happen!
21,1,2,The liposuction has had the opposite effect; now people completely avoid me.
16,0,0,I told you that I like to smell the flowers.
16,0,0,I am still trying to get in touch with my inner child.
26,14,3,Please tell me more about your family tree.
23,5,2,They laugh at you because they fear you.
38,2,1,I'm sick and tired of being the butt of terrible jokes.
17,2,0,Why do you think lack appeal?
36,12,4,I'm telling you doc, I just feel empty on the inside.
20,4,1,Sure you have thick skin, but I also detect pathological narcissism and a sensitivity stemming from unrealistic expectations.
18,2,1,You're starting down a slippery slope...
16,1,0,You've got to be skidding me!
19,2,1,I feel empty and unfulfilled.

20,7,1,Let's start with your early pollination.
21,5,1,You have made such great progress unpeeling all those layers!
16,1,0,What? I'm not suppose to show you my insides? I thought that's what therapy is all about.
14,0,0,And how does it make you feel when people call you 'slippery'?
31,9,6,Sure he slipped and fell. But what about MY pain?
17,2,0,Listen, can we move past all of this monkey talk?
28,8,3,Well, do you think that you're a tired, old joke?
51,8,3,Yes, you are quite appealing. But therapist/client relationships are always a slippery slope.
17,2,0,A Freudian slip has nothing to do with banana peels.
39,30,7,You seem to delight in bringing others down.
26,3,2,So you identify as a plantain in a banana peel…
24,6,2,No, you can't call me 'Jane!
18,2,0,So you see nothing in your future but brown spots, bruises, and banana peel jokes.
31,13,4,Sorry about my little Freudian split -I mean, slip, sorry!
27,7,3,You understand that the falls, the slapstick...that's not you.
15,1,0,I just... don't find life a-peeling anymore.
27,1,0,But you're not a cigar.

29,13,3,OK, I think we're getting into a slippery area now.
19,3,0,So, you're making an appeal to lessen the number of New Yorker psychiatrist cartoons?
23,0,0,Tell me about your accident dreams.
22,7,1,Well no, that's not really what "Freudian slip" means...
43,9,1,Going bananas? It appears you've arrived.
31,15,3,Why do you think he fell for you?
31,6,2,I'll never be anything but a punchline
20,0,2,Sorry. I know you have to peel away the outside to get at a problem but I was hungry.
19,1,1,Four foot, six foot, eight foot bunch?
33,8,7,You've started down a slippery slope.
18,3,0,So how did it make you feel when your owner ate you?
22,7,1,At least you're no longer green with envy.
26,7,2,So you're saying you feel very empty inside?
16,0,0,Evolution did you say?
17,4,0,What is happening when you get this feeling that everyone is laughing at you?
23,3,2,Have you ever considered the possibility that they might be laughing **with** you?
19,2,1,That was a slip of the tongue.
24,6,3,No one can make you feel like trash without your permission.
23,4,2,How long have you had this feeling that you're just an empty suit...?
21,3,2,Did she split or did you give her the slip?
15,1,1,I don't know whether to laugh or cry!
28,0,0,Great legs- guys fall for me too but don't marry
15,0,0,Let's get real here. This is not just some joke. Have you ever considered it might be, "up slip," not, "slip up," that is your real motivation?
19,1,1,I think you may be suffering from peel envy.
26,4,1,So the banana fana fofana has been hard to live with,correct?
19,3,0,Slippin', sliden' away--is that your mantra?
33,14,4,We don't see nuts until the second year of residency.
23,2,2,So, how did your mother feel about your passion for tort reform?
25,16,1,So tell me exactly why the term 'second banana' is such a problem for you.
40,1,1,I can't help you if you are going to continue to use such slippery language.
24,6,2,It all started as a little joke.
25,7,2,Why do you feel empty inside?
33,20,9,And, then, he decided to make a smoothie.
18,2,1,Let's talk family history - what, six hand, seven hand, eight hand bunch?
21,4,1,Why do you think your always tripping people up?
17,1,0,Eaten and thrown away. I'm sure you know what it's like Doc.
16,1,0,Sitting in a chair will not make me fall for you.
25,7,1,Your insurance company will only pay for one of your split personalities.
21,2,1,i understand your empty feeling, going from top banana one day only to be tossed aside by a monkey the next.
16,2,0,Everyone loves a banana
33,7,6,Something seems to be eating you up inside.
29,7,4,I'm just afraid that no one will ever fall for me.
20,6,0,I have become a couch potato
21,5,1,How long have you felt you've lost your true inner essence?
30,3,4,What you are saying is that after being a comedy movie prop for so long, you think that you would like to direct.
17,1,0,How has the metamorphosis affected your mood?
23,9,2,Trust me, you're not the first. At least half my patients are 'bananas'.
18,0,1,Just how long have you been feeling like a heel?
19,3,0,What happens when people do walk all over you?
19,1,1,And why do you think no one takes your seriously?
34,10,5,I'm going to suggest a good compost pile.
18,4,0,Banana splits are junk food, but being a smoothie would be heroic.
17,2,1,Let's peel back into your childhood.
28,13,2,No, I'm not saying you're bananas, but you are on a very slippery slope.
30,11,0,You can't blame yourself. Accidents happen.
37,6,3,And why do you feel she was delighted over the split?
18,4,0,So, tell me about those peelings of inadequacy again...
15,0,0,I feel used and abused.
32,17,5,What do you mean you "gave him the slip"?
18,1,0,Exercise might help
18,2,0,Your peal is not a set of fingers and it has nothing to do with the size of your banana
21,5,1,I find you appealing despite your lack of substance.
20,1,1,You need not doubt yourself. Of courseyou have appeal.
19,4,0,What do you think it means, this slippery slope you keep dreaming of...
19,2,0,what is below the skin here?
27,2,4,Life is fruitless.
24,10,1,I know, it's a slippery slope.
26,5,3,It was just a Freudian slip.
22,6,1,I need your advice. I slipped up again.
16,1,0,The feelings of being empty inside started to go away after you suggested that perhaps I was born a different plant.
19,5,0,sounds like you have a banana split personality disorder
28,8,0,Pardon my slip.
29,7,5,Hmmm...you feel used and abandoned.
17,1,1,"Sorry" says the psychiatrist, "I can only help homo sapiens!
29,9,2,What if it's what's on the inside that matters?
21,5,1,It sounds to me like you have a split personality.
29,10,3,To be honest, there's a reason everyone treats you like some sort of joke.
26,8,3,No, I don't see your appeal.
21,2,0,How long have you had this feeling that you must peel your skin?
36,18,7,What you're feeling is classic survivor's guilt.

23,11,1,I understand the split has caused you a lot of grief.
9,0,0,And how often do you get this overwhelming urge to see people slip and fall?
34,16,4,Sure the jokes are hurtful but you need to develop a thicker skin.
17,1,0,Nobody finds me appealing.
24,4,2,Yes, I believe you are having some type of separation anxiety, but let's dig deeper.
30,7,2,How long have you been unfulfilled?
37,11,9,Talk to me about your nana issues.
28,7,0,When exactly did you stop feeling like a banana?
21,9,0,If you don't talk about your feelings, I'm afraid you'll just slip back into your old habits.
19,3,0,You have survivor’s guilt.
20,6,1,So why do you feel that "It's all a big joke"?
33,6,5,When you hear someone say "an apple a day keeps the doctor away," how does that make you feel?

23,2,0,You slip on me, baby, and I'll be sure to catch you.
23,3,3,It's hard for me to talk to psychologists. They always giggle when I say I feel empty inside.

36,12,7,How can I put this, you have appeal, but no substance.
21,7,1,So you think that your life has just been one big joke waiting to happen?

25,9,1,Let's talk about the bruises.
19,0,0,I personally know many not well hung who benefit from viagra...
17,1,0,It was traumatic! They ripped us from our stalks, shoved us in crates and nailed the lid shut. The next thing we knew, we were sold to a pushcart in Times Square.
17,3,0,You feel empty inside? I can empathize; so did I about 15 minutes ago.
34,1,0,Perhaps you could channel your destructive tendencies into a YouTube prank show.
30,10,4,Okay, your career as a condom model is over, but what about slapstick comedy?
21,6,1,She tore out my insides.
19,1,1,...and you still blame yourself for his injury? Let's see if we can't peel back another layer.
12,0,0,No. I was about to suggest "schadenfreude" not "schizoid".
16,2,0,I know it was a big loss, but you need to focus on you now.
14,0,0,You need to stop blaming yourself for that Freudian slip.
16,0,0,If you don't mind, reality therapy might be more appropriate than Freudian analysis.
19,3,1,I'd rather you sit. I'm a Freudian and I would hate to slip.
15,0,0,What kind of appeal?
25,4,3,I feel like my whole life has become the punch line to a bad joke.

27,5,4,What did he think was going to happen if he kept stepping all over you?
15,0,0,Every time I slip, my friends say: "Heh! Freud."
27,12,3,We don't use the phrase "he went bananas" anymore, but in your case ...
26,5,4,You need to understand your appeal.
11,0,0,It says here that you switched therapists because the last one 'slipped up'
22,1,0,Is it the Freudian slips or brown spots that make you peel more appallingly?
19,2,1,It's just such a slippery slope...
20,2,1,Tell me more about how you and your bunch slid across the border.
44,6,2,Sometimes those who love us hurt us the most.
20,3,1,So how did that make you feel when "chiquited' on you?
27,3,4,When did you first notice that you were losing appeal?
29,6,4,Yes, Plantain is bigger, but your sweeter.
21,4,1,Not another case of split personality disorder...

18,3,0,I'm very accident-prone. What does that mean, doctor?
15,0,0,It feels like I am the one who is always containing the relationship.
28,3,4,Maybe you should just be grateful. The cartoon business has gotten you this far.
20,2,1,Maybe you slip away from people too much
15,0,0,I’m referring you to Dr. Slapstick. You’re too slippery for me.
23,5,2,I'm tired of people walking all over me.
28,9,4,Why would you want to give up a career in comedy?
25,11,0,Tell me why you feel so empty.
15,0,0,And what is it about looking at me that makes you so sure Darwin got it, as you say, all wrong.
26,5,3,Tell me how you're peeling today
25,2,2,And that's how it came to be called the 'Freudian slip.'
27,6,4,Tell me more about these feelings you have about always being on the outside....
27,8,3,I just don't get the appeal in hanging with the rest of the bunch.
25,4,0,Since Conchita left me, the bunch has sided with her and now I am turning to mush; Doc, can you save my skin?
17,0,0,What would you do if I wasn't here?
24,4,1,Sad to say, you're not the first to leave the bunch green, have your body exploited and cast aside on the streets.
17,3,0,You know that taking a walk is not an option.
18,1,0,Should I call 911, your lover, or your wife?
23,5,2,So, it's obvious why you're here. You should know I charge a bunch.

19,4,0,It sounds like abandonment issues to me. Having a father split at a young age can be very tough.
36,2,2,I know you split, but tell me how you really feel.
22,4,1,I sense you're feeling abandoned ...
27,5,3,In my professional opinion, you ARE enabling slapstick.
49,7,1,Let me ask the questions. Do you think people find you appealing?
20,0,1,Don't internalize blame -- it is his own fault he slipped on you. Howard F. Taylor, Princeton, N. J.
26,8,3,You seem to have a split personality.
22,4,2,And how did you feel when Donald Trump started to call you 'Slippery Pete'?
15,0,0,So. Tell me more about this "sexual slippage," as you call it, between media representation of fantasy and your perceived objective reality.
20,3,1,We've covered the emptiness -- let's talk about your mother.
21,5,1,It really isn't what's inside that counts
37,13,10,And in the dream, I'm strangling the gorilla.
20,5,0,Hurting someone isn't going to help you feel whole.
20,0,1,I mean, I'm actually not even slippery.
21,5,1,Why do you feel that your life is a slippery slope?
17,0,1,So you feel you're not appealing?
34,17,5,Let's explore why you often feel compelled to make people laugh at the expense of others.
18,5,0,So you don't find yourself appealing anymore?
15,3,0,Yes, but calling it a 'Freudian' slip seems a bit grandiose.
19,3,1,Things have been pretty rough ever since the split.
21,1,1,So you're saying you feel as if you lost the hero inside yourself.
17,2,0,Why don't you like banana cream pie?
24,3,2,This isn't right, but I think I'm falling for you.
40,22,9,Would you like to talk about what's eating you?
26,7,3,Next time can you bring your other half?
20,3,1,When did you discover that your wife had an affair with a tomato?
15,0,0,Explain what you mean by you feel your slipping away
19,3,1,I think we all struggle with feeling of emptiness on some level.
23,4,2,So you're now feeling like the second banana ?
28,10,3,To keep things in perspective, it's important to remember that it's not just your ego that was bruised...
35,11,8,You feel you're appealing but have a sense of inner loss.
16,2,1,I caused him to slip and fall...
23,4,2,This is not what I meant when I said you should re-evaluate your core beliefs.
19,2,1,You feel guilty about causing someone to slip?
19,2,1,You don't say
30,6,5,When did you first experience these empty feelings?
22,2,2,Maybe next session we can discuss your fear of sliding into oblivion.
16,2,0,DON'T WORRY, IN YOUR CONDITION IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE A SLIP
32,12,6,You're a fruit. Get used to it.
20,3,1,Yes, but everyone slips up at some point."
25,6,2,I think there might be a link between your sense of internal emptiness and your compulsion to make people slip up in public.
18,3,0,It seems like your relationships fail because you split.
19,2,1,When did you first feel disconnected.
27,5,4,What do you do for fun?
28,11,1,I know people are saying you're bananas but my diagnosis is split personality
17,2,0,In analysis, it's what you hear, not what you see.
26,4,1,Actually, you cause more of a Freudian slip.
15,0,0,A priest, a rabbi. . . Then stage fright. It was a slippery slope.
28,1,4,I never thought I'd meet the Invisible Man.
21,4,2,You feel you are an accident waiting to happen, part of some cosmic, slapstick joke?
26,8,5,So you've been feeling empty since the split.
22,10,1,I'm tempted to ask how that makes you peel.
24,6,2,i think we are heading down a slippery slope
23,8,1,How does it make you feel when people walk all over you?
17,1,0,Two Walls
19,2,1,Yes, I know you're happy to see me.
19,1,1,Yes, I do understand that that slip wasn't consciously intended.
21,4,1,So, why do you think everyone falls for you?
19,5,0,Do you think your problems stem from always feeling like a second banana?
17,2,0,Do you have an idea about why it keeps happening?
16,1,0,As a banana, you must realize your limitations in a world dominated by people.
23,5,2,When did you first realize you are an empty suit?
24,3,2,Now that you are halfway towards your transition into a Donut, how are you feeling about your decision?
39,4,0,I think it all began with your father slipping away from you at such a young age.
22,5,1,We all feel unfulfilled at some point in our lives.
25,10,2,I don't know what it is Doctor. I just don't see the humor in it anymore...
15,1,0,So, you feel you're the slip up in other people's lives.
29,8,4,My advice--move on....we can't all be top banana
35,7,2,We'll, if we go down that road, we're on that slippery slope you always end up on!
26,7,3,Even though you have no substance, you can still have appeal.
24,6,2,Now tell me, when did you first start feeling empty inside?
15,0,0,I was born a trial lawyer.
23,5,0,I really don't think you should feel guilty for causing a Freudian slip.
33,11,6,No, I don't think your slips are Freudian.
26,10,2,Let's talk about why you feel so empty inside.
22,4,2,So you've been slipping back into the same old habits?
23,7,1,I see your only skin deep.
17,2,0,Doctor, I'd like to get back with my ex. I just can't handle the constant slip-ups."
20,3,3,'You're just not appealing.'
29,4,2,I was stripped and left for dead; you shouldn't be surprised that I retaliated by tripping him.
17,3,0,I believe we are dealing with edible issues.
19,4,1,Why blame yourself if it was only a Freudian slip?
24,5,2,I used to get a million laughs, then along came attorneys
41,17,11,Thanks for finally opening up.
19,1,1,So, you feel your life is slip, sliding away.
22,7,1,If you weren't my therapist and I wasn't a banana, would you....
19,2,1,You shouldn't blame yourself that he slipped and broke his leg.
17,2,0,I'm sure we can work out a payment option somehow.
20,7,0,At what point did you start to feel him slipping away?
16,0,0,You're a sadomasochist who inflicts pain by being stepped on?
26,6,3,Tell me how you're peeling
25,12,2,Have you considered joining a compost heap?
50,26,14,And how have things been going for you since your banana split?
16,1,0,Seriously, they don't see you're a peel?
18,2,0,Typecast or not- you must embrace playing the part of being slipped upon.
16,0,0,Don't look at your Psychiatrist like this. I will sue you for sexual harassment.
32,1,0,I'll work with you on that trait of being slippery..
17,1,0,Okay, let's start from when you were first pot-trained.
26,5,4,Not every fruit gets to have zest.
24,2,3,Your actions will lead you down a slippery slope.
26,4,3,It wasn't your fault. It was a Freudian slip.
28,4,5,Ever since I opened up to you, I get the feeling that everyone is avoiding me.
16,0,0,It feels like he's just slipping away
31,8,5,I can't understand why she didn't find you appealing.
18,1,1,You say she dumped you?
23,8,3,I keep having this dream where every guy I meet falls flat on his ass.
34,7,1,I'm just tired of constantly getting stepped on, you know?
26,7,3,I get it now. It wasn't the split. You feel that you've been stepped on all your life.
17,2,0,Wilted Lilly, banana peel, octopus, - you need to identify with your real self.
35,10,6,Your life isn't a joke.
17,2,0,Just because you had a slip, we don't have to split.
32,10,5,How long have you been separated?
26,11,2,What did you do to prepare yourself for the inevitable split.
28,7,4,A Freudian slip, no doubt.
17,2,0,These slips of yours need to stop.
19,7,0,It is not at all unnatural to encounter feelings of emptiness given your recent circumstances
28,5,1,That's a pretty slippery answer to my question.
16,1,0,No, your unconscious is not like an onion. It's more like...a banana.
30,7,2,When did you get the feeling that you are no longer appealing?
22,8,1,So, you say it's Splitsville.
17,2,0,That's quite a big Freudian slip you just made.....
19,4,0,Monkey see, monkey do, banana go to therapy.
16,3,0,Clear case of split personality here...
24,6,2,When did these dreams of being smoked first begin?
14,1,0,So how long has the eggplant emoji made you feel inadequate?
20,2,1,Say more about what is making you feel so unappealing.
32,6,0,She slipped on you! Do you blame yourself?
30,9,6,So, she split on Sundae?
22,5,0,I feel like a shell of my former self.
18,0,1,You say you feel empty and hollow? I'm going to prescribe one clown slipping.
37,11,6,It does appear that your last campaign took a lot out of you, Mr. Dole.
17,2,0,Why do you think you are always in a split?
28,9,4,And how do you feel when the person falls?
28,6,5,I have this recurring nightmare, Doc...I'm on a sidewalk and NO ONE slips!
31,8,4,Sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel.
23,4,2,You still have appeal.
21,1,2,You're a mere shell of yourself, all spent.
18,2,0,Let's talk about your latest slip up.
21,4,1,I dunno doc, it just feels like the whole world is slipping away from me.
33,17,4,But when you let them walk all over you, they're the ones that get hurt.
35,15,6,I'm glad you're finally opening up.
30,11,4,Let's explore the difference between a phallic symbol and a sex symbol.
19,1,1,Don't be so hard on yourself. Every top banana hits the skids.
18,3,0,Yes, banana lives matter.
22,6,1,How do you think I feel, talking to a banana peel?
38,1,2,My banana left me because he said he had appeal without me.
26,14,2,Tell me about the day you got your peelings hurt.
30,12,5,So, how did that make you peel...I mean feel?
28,9,4,How exactly do you feel used?
18,4,0,I understand. Plantains are getting all the attention lately. Get over it!
17,2,0,Since my wife split, I have a hard time feeling a-peeling.
19,1,1,O.K., let's recap: you've lost a lot of weight; you're lost you sex appeal; you don't feel whole any more, you miss your bunch of buddies and you sense that you are slipping. Time to recycle your life.
28,8,4,So you feel you've lost your manhood?
16,0,0,You’re the Freudian slip expert. Do you think naming the nursing home after me is appropriate?
35,5,6,...or are you just happy to see me?
19,6,0,You were telling me about your obsessive thoughts that everyone goes out of their way to avoid you.
20,6,0,And why do YOU think they won't consider you for dramatic roles, Miss Peel?
25,8,2,So to summarize, you feel discarded ?
20,7,0,My new in-laws are a bunch of nuts.
18,0,0,The people who seem to be problem-less, often have the most.
27,4,2,Tell me more about your peelings.
19,3,0,How long have you and your ex been split up?
15,1,0,Perhaps you should seek another therapist. Lately, I feel as though I'm slipping.
15,0,0,Doc, I feel like my wife is slipping away from me.
28,10,3,Tell me why you don't feel appealing.
21,1,1,You're projecting again . . . you are not the butt of ALL jokes.
24,9,2,When I said I wanted you to be open with me, that's not exactly what I meant
28,6,4,Your insecurity is certainly not due lack of appeal.
20,3,1,I had been doing very well, but lately I seem to be slipping up.
32,15,5,So you're feeling stepped on?
25,2,0,You're a natural self-saboteur...
30,12,5,Let's talk about these so-called Freudian slips.
33,4,0,But why assume they're laughing at you?
15,0,0,So how does it make you feel when you cause people to slip up?
15,0,0,Do you feel that others blame you for their mistakes?
23,2,1,No, I do not find you a-peeling.
19,2,0,Your saying that Jimmy Durante is the last person to spin a positive message about bananas?
48,24,15,Our time is up and please don't wait for me on the stairs.
18,2,0,I no longer feel appealing
17,0,0,And when did it start bothering you that these strings have no name?
24,3,3,I see you've already met my therapy dog.
23,6,2,Doc, I'm worried I'm bipolar; sometimes I feel like a banana and other times a plantain
33,4,2,This is clear evidence of a split personality.
18,5,0,So you feel that you open yourself up too much in relationships?
20,4,1,That's confidential. Banana is also my client.
19,2,1,I'm afraid your mental health insurance doesn't include slip-and-fall coverage.
25,2,4,About an hour ago I woke up in the garbage can with this empty feeling.
22,4,1,I'm just tired of being stepped on doc like I'm some joke.
27,0,1,So, you think you're the top banana and side-splittingly funny? You don't really think you can slip that by me, do you?
28,2,5,No, I don't know how many Freudians it take to slip on a banana peel!
27,5,3,First, you have to let go of the guilt.
30,13,5,You have appeal but no substance.
16,1,0,I think you'll find this feeling of emptiness is just part of the modern condition.
20,3,1,So...tell me again...why did you and your better half split?
15,0,0,You are feeling empty. Have you eaten?
31,3,1,The Fall of Man is hardly a laughing matter, Mr. Peel.
24,3,0,Now we can peel back and get to your core.
36,10,6,I'm not sure we can peel anymore layers away..
16,1,0,At this point you're just repeating yourself
28,6,4,But what's really missing on the inside?
28,8,3,Your insides have been sliced up, slathered in buttery sauce and ignited over a bed of vanilla ice cream? I'm afraid we'll need another session to unpack that metaphor, Mr. Foster.
21,4,1,The truth is, no one _really_ falls for your type.
19,2,1,Others I've treated have come out of tail pipes and are doing just fine.
14,1,0,So... how does it make you feel when your father calls you 'monkey trash?'
29,4,5,Okay, I'll write you a prescription for Viagra.
27,8,2,So the split was really hard on you.
22,2,2,I always wondered what made a Freudian slip.
24,9,1,Can you tell me more about this reoccuring dream you have about being stepped on?
15,1,0,So Mr. Peal, when did these feelings of 'Goin' Bananas' begin?
19,2,1,Stop calling me bananas, dammit!
30,9,5,I feel used and discarded.
25,8,2,It can get slippery when you open up.
17,1,0,So, when did start believing you were President?
23,6,2,Yes, but have you considered that you wanted to make them slip?
31,4,1,Would you say you caused the slip up?
18,1,0,How does that make you peel? Can you also describe this peeling in 5 words or less?
18,3,0,Let the tomato laugh. He's stuck at first base.
19,3,0,You may think I have great legs, but you have no appeal for me.
20,7,0,Tell me more about always feeling like the fall guy...
28,6,4,When did you first feel you were a zucchini?
23,3,1,.... regardless - I don't date patients.
20,6,0,Nonsense. You are a peeling.
16,0,0,You had a major break through by pealing back your emotions, getting to the core and storing the flesh of the problem where it belongs.
35,12,7,It's not your responsibility to make everyone laugh.
21,1,1,First, stop giggling.
15,0,0,It's not rhetorical question.
19,1,1,He slipped so I came instead.
21,4,1,That's quite the Freudian slip.
21,0,0,So instead of being squashed you want to be the one who falls? You realize that poses another set of problems?
17,2,0,You are depressed that people eat apples with the skin but not bananas?
17,4,0,Something must be missing inside of me because I always make women fall hard for me but I don't fall for them.
19,3,0,So, you enjoy making slip-ups?
31,2,6,Now how do these dreams of clowns stepping on you make you feel?
21,7,1,You've slipped since our last session.
20,2,1,That's very interesting, tell me how that makes you peel.
24,11,1,There's usually more to talk about once we've peeled back all these layers.
29,6,4,Emotionally, you are just an accident waiting to happen.
23,4,1,So your dad split when you pretty young, huh?
27,7,3,Technically, what you experienced is not a Freudian slip.
22,7,1,People say I bring them down
23,5,2,Tell me more about these abandonment issues.
15,0,0,Let's focus on externalizing.
18,2,1,Doc, I'm tired of feeling empty inside.
24,11,1,You'll be fine -- I deal with splits all the time.
26,6,3,When will somebody REALLY fall for me?
17,2,0,Your feel that your ability to "slip up" has caused you to loose your appeal?
26,3,1,You seem to be going down a slippery slope.
17,0,0,Our session has ended. It's time for you to make like a tree and leave.
25,9,1,You need to stop punishing yourself for causing her downfall.
20,6,0,And tell me again why you think people laugh at you
25,8,2,And sometimes a cigar is just a good smoke.
25,10,3,Then she said "Orange you glad I said Banana"...
25,8,2,Your fear of becoming a vegetable is irrational.
15,2,0,I told you not to split!
23,6,2,Can you go back to the part where you said you felt like your heart went through a blender?
25,4,3,Why do you feel I've used you for my own personal gratification?
48,17,12,Yes, you made her fall for you. But you really hurt her in the process.
28,7,4,It's always apples versus oranges and I'm really starting to feel left out.
19,2,0,And the guy tripped and I went flying and landed on Donald Trump's head, and nobody noticed.
24,8,1,The split-up was very painful.
23,11,1,I feel you've lost touch with your inner self.
16,1,0,Was your hand raised happily?
32,9,5,Peeling away the layers to get at the truth.. forgive me. It's just an expression we use.
16,5,0,When did you first start having nightmares of gorillas?
19,2,1,After Barney the Banana described in detail his intimate dreams about her, his therapist decided it was time for him to split.
35,0,0,So when did you start your fear of analysts, Mr. Bonzo..., Mr. Bonzo?
17,2,0,Who told you you have any anthropomorphic qualities?
12,0,0,You're a textbook disabler.
18,2,1,It could be postpartum depression, but tell me more about the split.
29,13,5,To be honest, you are empty inside.
20,5,1,I wasn't even his second banana.
17,3,0,Okay, under hypnosis, you've peeled away all my layers; now show me where you hid the banana.
44,8,4,I know you feel empty inside, but try and stay positive – someone could slip on you and that would be hilarious.
28,5,2,okay Chaquita what have you come to say?
27,7,3,Talk to me about your Freudian slip.
54,26,12,Could be worse…at least you’re not nuts.
22,5,1,Are you ready to talk about your feelings of emptyness?
52,9,4,The question isn’t, why didn’t they laugh? The question is, why do you think it’s funny?
24,13,1,It's OK. Not everything you do needs to knock people off their feet.
19,0,0,I like to eat,eat, eat, apples and banninees
57,5,0,For the last time, my falling on you would not be a Freudian slip.... It's called transference.
17,1,0,So you say your turning into a banana, we start by pulling yourself together
21,5,1,You always feel stepped on?
23,3,3,Don't worry - we all feel like we're going bananas some days.
34,15,6,And why do you describe yourself as an 'accident waiting to happen'?
30,10,4,For next week's session, let's work on being a cantelope
18,4,0,Your banana, split?
21,5,1,Is this some sort of joke?
37,17,7,I am going to recommend more potassium.
21,4,1,It's biological.
28,2,0,I don't know. I guess when it came down to it I never thought we'd ACTUALLY split.
19,1,1,Now, how can we turn "I feel like some kind of accident magnet" into something less self-victimizing?
18,3,0,When did you first feel like a plantain in a banana's body?
21,5,1,Fruitless? Yellow? Slippery? Can you be more specific?
53,8,3,I slipped up and now we're headed for splitsville.
34,6,0,Don's therapist told him it happens to everyone, it is normal with age.
26,7,3,Please, tell me how you peel.
58,9,3,I feel so empty inside. Like I'm all eaten up.
31,6,2,Another Freudian slip?
20,6,0,When did you first realize that you were losing your grip.
20,4,1,This must've been a devastating split-up.
272,285,228,It's normal to feel empty after a split.
19,1,1,But I don't mean to cause people to slip, I just can't help myself.
23,10,1,What can I say, doc? I slipped up.
22,5,2,You're thin-skinned. Your ego bruises easily. And by the look of those brown spots, your time is up.
27,5,2,I feel like everyone avoids me
32,14,6,Explain to me why you feel empty and used.
15,0,0,Yes, you're involved. But guilty for those blunders? Let's talk!
34,10,7,Such feelings of emptiness are not uncommon.
21,6,1,So when he stepped on you, how did that make you feel?
17,2,0,You're slapstick phobic?
42,15,11,I think to focus on what you have lost would be fruitless.
18,2,0,I think you need some time to peel.
18,3,0,Why do you feel you have no purpose?
29,0,0,Now we need to focus on building you back up.
28,12,1,When did you first notice your split persona?
19,5,0,You shouldn't feel inferior just because you're not labelled organic.
19,3,0,It hurts on the inside.
22,8,0,So, when did you first notice this sense of feeling hollow?
16,0,0,,,,,so...after the banana split, you were an accident waiting to happen.
24,5,2,I know you are a peeling but that's not what I meant
47,16,17,You keep looking at my feet.
20,2,1,So he slipped, but you were bruised?
52,33,14,Maybe you want to be stepped on.
50,3,2,A Banana is a Banana....How many times do I have to say this?
34,5,0,The appeal will be classified under "separation anxiety."
18,4,0,Are you familiar with the term "Freudian slip"?
17,2,0,Now that you've slipped into something more comfortable...."
23,9,3,Would you like to discuss the split?
18,3,0,And remember, the next Big Slip Up is right around the corner.
23,5,2,When they called you yellow..how did that make you peel?
18,4,0,Maybe you could start by explaining your appeal.
27,12,2,In these dreams then, the monkey figure represents the manifestation of your worst fears.
20,6,0,Sometimes a banana doesn't want to be just a banana.
19,2,1,If only I'd been born a toupee.
15,0,0,I'm sorry Mr. Hide, but you did not invent the Freudian slip.
20,7,0,Are you insecure about always being the "fall guy"?
19,5,0,I feel like I'm just a shell of my former self.
18,0,1,Stop undressing me with your eyes...
17,2,0,In my case "going bananas" is not just an expression.
23,13,0,So you say you're not peeling very well.
21,8,0,And when he slipped, how did that make you peel?
19,3,1,So tell me, when did your life start slipping away?
18,0,0,Do you think this is funny? I told you never to come here.
19,3,0,Your issues are certainly appealing.
18,2,0,The desire for revenge is normal.
26,7,3,I used to be the top banana.....
17,2,0,Okay, let's try peeling back the layers now, shall we.
15,0,0,So, you think been consumed all consumed by this passion?
14,0,0,What you describe is a classic case of Oedipus complex, Cavendish
16,1,0,Last night I dreamt that Freud slipped on me!
22,5,1,Tell me more about this fear that you're at the end of your sell-by date.
19,2,1,Everyone tries to walk all over me
18,0,1,So, you've only recently begun to have feelings of gender confusion?
24,2,0,Tell me about the time when she slipped
21,3,1,Let's try and peel back an earlier incident when you were tossed aside.
32,5,0,I feel like I'm slipping.
20,4,1,So, tell me about this new emptiness you feel, and why you think you're such a danger to others.
19,3,0,And when did you two split?
40,10,5,Have you looked for jobs in sex education?
20,3,1,I think it goes back to the day my father split.
33,4,1,I'm glad you're here, Alan. This is the first step to uncovering your fear of getting walked on.
18,1,1,Can you get a grip?
32,22,3,Why do you feel you are a danger to others?
17,2,1,How are you peeling?
17,2,1,I gave her the slip, and now she's suing.
18,2,0,Your failure to respond is not helpful.
17,5,0,Let's explore more deeply these dreams where you're being chased by an ice cream truck
34,8,3,I don't want you slipping back into old habits.
24,6,2,This seems to be less psychiatry and more internal medicine.
27,7,2,You've got a split personality
23,2,2,My first approach would be to assure you that your ancestors are not responsible for Dr. Freud's theory.
20,7,1,So when did you first feel like you had a split personality?
24,3,2,Well it's not unethical to eat your client if your hungry and it's a fruit.
17,2,0,You don't think you're funny anymore? We call that "Gallagher Syndrome.
15,0,0,What! Sure, I know humans share 50% of our DNA with bananas...but, I don't share!
42,13,9,Have you tried a potassium supplement?
17,2,0,You seem less phallic obsessive this week.
24,1,4,are you talking slip as "on a banana peel" or as "Freudian"?
22,7,1,It is a slippery slope, indeed...
19,1,1,How long have you had this feeling of adequacy?
28,6,4,You'd rather be empty than risk going soft.
18,3,0,Let's go back to the mustachioed man and the day of the crash.
48,24,16,So you feel stepped on, but everyone else thinks its funny...
21,4,0,Remember, it's what's inside that counts.
15,1,0,Do others in my position find that peeling off is actually a slippery slope?
30,8,5,So tell me when you first felt like everything was slipping away?
20,6,0,So how long have you been feeling empty inside?
16,0,0,And you think you're pretty splayed out liked that?
22,3,2,So when did you start blaming yourself for the slips of others?
23,7,2,Well, it's about what is on the inside that matters, and maybe that is your problem.
38,14,9,I don't agree that your therapy has been fruitless.
34,2,0,Watch out for a slippery slope
15,0,0,Your self-destruction stems from co-dependence with the chimp.
19,2,0,Of course you're polymorph perverse
15,0,0,Yes, I'm certain Freud didn't mean you should start at the VERY Beginning!
19,1,1,I understand how you self identify, but I am not calling you a fruit.
17,1,0,No! Not even if you had a bone.
23,4,1,Let's return to the monkey business that we were exploring in our last session.
26,7,3,It's not what's on your outside that counts, it's what's on your—oh, right.
27,4,4,How long have you felt that there's something missing in your life
42,17,4,Don't beat yourself up. Not everyone can do comedy.
18,3,0,Yes, Yes, I am sure you were once quite the specimen but lets explore those feelings of inadequacy.
32,0,1,It's time we talked about finding a new purpose.
18,0,1,The alternative was Uber...
68,44,29,So what's been eating you lately?
20,6,0,We all slip. It's getting back up that takes courage.
21,5,1,So she told you that you have "a peel," but no substance underneath, hmm?
15,0,0,Used, tossed away, empty inside? We could swap notes, pal.
20,9,0,That's a slippery slope you're going down.
19,2,1,Now, tell me more about this dream where you slipped and fell on yourself...
40,6,2,So when did you first become aware you had lost your appeal?
19,5,0,I feel my life slipping away.
20,6,0,Seriously? You're not "peeling" very well?
14,0,0,Inanimate objects like me should be respected like all other people!
16,0,0,Well, it will be tough to blame the issues on your parents since you were produced asexually.
16,0,0,So, you're feeling like an old chestnut.
21,5,1,The good news is you're not going bananas. The bad news is it's cause you're already there.
18,3,0,Now, on those occasions when you were being punished -- placed in the refrigerator--was the refrigerator light on, or were you in total darkness?
32,16,4,Were you bruised as a child?
40,18,9,I was minding my own business, and he slipped on me, yet everyone ran to him to see if HE was OK.
16,0,0,Try to be even more revealing.
19,5,0,You need to come out of your skin.
16,0,0,And when would you say that you first noticed the yellow fleshy part of you get squeezed out of your life?
26,7,3,People step all over me and then pretend like they're the victim.
17,1,0,I'm determined to surface the hidden cause of your feelings of emptiness and abandonment.
14,1,0,Debbie's afternoon client used far fewer tissues than her morning client, the onion peel.
28,6,1,I feel like my life has been slipping away from me.
18,3,0,How did you slip back in here?
18,4,0,Let's start by pealing back the years.
17,2,0,Guess this means you slipped up.
46,2,0,does Dave know what he's doing?
17,1,0,Sure, on the surface you're bananas. But deep down inside you're clearly nuts.
22,4,1,Last week you felt soft.
31,12,2,Today I want to focus on your fear of clowns.
18,2,1,That reminds me- I also need to pick up nuts and maraschino cherries.
30,18,2,Tell me more about your bruised childhood.
18,2,1,I understand you feel guilty, but it is not your fault.
15,0,0,Yes, people don't actually slip on you, but maybe you should try to be happy that you are getting work. Think about your poor cousin, the pineapple skin.
28,5,3,Listen, letting go is hard.
20,9,0,You feel the Chaplin estate owes your great great great great great great great... grandfather some royalties?
35,4,1,My girlfriend, Olive, just doesn't understand me.
16,0,0,There may be some lingering resentment.
24,3,1,We have to peel back some layers to get to the root of your fear of gorillas.
26,5,3,Just start by telling me how you peel.
20,5,0,It's just transference. I'm not falling for you.
68,31,30,Okay, so it was a breach of professional ethics, but... I was hungry.
25,6,3,You have to stop blaming yourself, he's the one who slipped!
31,17,3,Well of course everyone falls for you.
15,2,1,Do you find yourself slipping?
22,7,1,Let's talk more about your parent's split.
20,2,1,Reassignment surgery is very difficult.
42,7,0,Of course you feel abandoned...
17,2,0,Ever since I was a child I wanted to be more than something to slip on.
20,2,1,No, I am not going to do that with my legs.
18,4,0,And how long have you had these feelings of emasculation?
17,1,0,No slips and falls this week - is that your problem?
21,4,2,I feel you slipping away
21,5,1,No you're not paranoid you do make people slip up
32,5,1,We all feel divided some times....
30,8,5,I sense you feel fruitless and unappealing.
22,5,1,How does allowing things to slip make you feel?
23,0,3,Tell me again why you don't think your appealing.
19,5,0,It sounds to me like cucumber envy.
18,3,0,When did you first start to feel that you were different?
40,11,11,I am sorry. I was hungry and I didn't realize you were the patient.
19,3,1,And this feeling started after you were separated from your family?
18,4,0,Other than an apple core and a peach pit, do you have any other personalities?
22,6,1,Taking people down for laughs—have you considered how it might hurt them?
32,25,6,Well, I see there is no point in discussing your inner feelings today.
19,1,1,Relax, You'll never be stalked again.
16,0,0,Hmmmm. Uh-huh. That's a potentially good insight, Mr. Dreckenburg, but would you consider the possibility that your Freudian slip might merit a more psychological interpretation?
32,10,5,You mustn't feel as if you're alone. I have a whole bunch of clients like you.
37,21,6,Why do you feel the need to compare yourself to apples and oranges?
18,3,0,What do you mean you have regressive illusions of becoming a starfish?
15,0,0,Stop calling me Sugar, I'm Mr Cavendish to you.
24,2,2,If I have such appeal why is everyone avoiding me!?
17,1,0,Ok Bo, it's your money, but I have to remind you that this is not the name game.
18,2,1,Keep it in your peel! I'm not that kind of therapist.
16,1,0,You need to feel more comfortable being the beginning of the slippery slope.
14,0,0,What you call toxic, Doc, I call obvious.
17,2,0,What makes you feel that you are the butt end of a joke?
18,4,0,I don't know, Doc...I just don't feel I'm appealing.
19,0,2,My dissertation was on Freudian slips.
21,4,1,You have to forgive yourself. Nobody could have seen that coming.
17,4,0,Of course you've been sterotyped. But that's not the real you.
21,4,1,When did you start pretending you were an octopus?.
18,2,1,I'm in touch with my peelings, uh, I mean feelings! Huh, almost slipped on that one!
17,4,0,I don't know what to raise first, that you're completely bananas or the Freudian slip.
31,6,1,I definitely think your split personality, Mrs. B., stems from your chocolaholic husband desserting you.
19,2,1,Once again Harold, clothes don't make the man.
21,5,1,I've been robbed of my sex appeal.
19,9,0,I know you say you just happened to be on the sidewalk, but do you think unconsciously you wanted him to fall?
27,0,0,Give me a break Mr. Flower. I don't want to exaggerate my billing, so you'll just have to sit there for an hour.
23,4,2,At some stage we will have to move on from your feelings of being used only for a laugh and address your fear of peanut butter and bread.
16,1,0,No, I wouldn't diagnose you as nuts just a little fruity.
37,2,0,I still have a long way to goooooo...........
16,0,0,How long have you felt like and empty-suit?'\
19,2,0,Your suggestive remarks are not appealing to me!
17,2,0,When were you first aware you could shape shift into a banana?
22,6,1,And why do you feel unappealing?
30,4,0,Isn't it time to let go of your guilt
19,6,0,And then, she just slipped ...
16,0,0,I slipped when I said that.
20,1,1,You say you're thick-skinned, but people have seen through your façade and have taken advantage of you.
15,0,0,Life's impact
14,0,0,But, Doctor, I still can't stop thinking of you as my first husband ...
22,1,2,Tell me more about this eviseration.
20,6,0,Well, recently I've had this empty feeling.
20,5,0,Why do you think you have a split personality?
32,7,6,I'm sorry for coming apart like this.
19,3,1,Sorry, we only do couple's therapy.
40,29,7,Talk more about your feelings of being used and discarded.
19,2,1,I think I am going bananas
25,11,2,Something inside of me is missing.
23,9,2,Everyone I get close to just walks all over me. Then we both get hurt.
20,5,0,It is not your fault when someone slips.
16,0,0,really were did you ditch the monkey
16,1,0,I have another client, a pie, that I'd like you to meet.
15,1,0,So. You overheard this person say she felt as worthless as a banana peel after the banana's been eaten. How did this make you feel?
24,7,3,You say you feel empty inside?
36,7,1,...of course, most narcissists describe themselves as appealing.
20,0,2,What makes you think that the political system is suffering from just a potassium deficiency?
17,3,0,Do you feel light headed?
28,3,4,You have to learn to face the ugly truth; after this election, slapstick is dead.
60,54,26,I'm so tired of people blaming me for their slip-ups.
21,1,2,I realize we should maintain a professional, doctor and patient relationship, but be honest: Do I appeal to you?
31,7,1,Now, you say you've been experiencing a lot of slip ups lately?
18,2,1,Let's not compare apples to oranges, ok?
32,12,5,Look at it this way. You're also a great source of humor.
18,1,0,Me! Me! Why is everybody slipping on Me?
22,2,2,You sure are a mouthful.
25,8,2,Again, you're heading down a slippery slope.
15,0,0,'' Lily, I love that perfume you're wearing.''
20,5,0,Lately, I've been feeling empty inside
29,13,3,When did you feel him slipping away from you?
19,2,1,Tell me about yourself.
22,6,2,So what makes you think your life is just a joke?
16,1,0,It sounds as if your self-loathing is really driven by your jealousy of the Blue Shell.
15,0,0,Sometimes I fantasize about being ravaged by a group of chimps, doc" "That's just an a-peel to your id- a phallic fixation
20,3,1,What's the difference between a Freudian slip and a Jungian slip?
22,0,0,I split up with my wife and she got her half of me from the divorce.
19,5,0,I really have fallen for you!
19,2,1,You are afraid my of monkeys and have penis envy?
29,4,2,It's going to be a while before you feel whole again.
16,1,0,So she just slipped on you?
18,2,0,What I think you are telling me is that you feel unwanted.
25,12,1,People just walk all over me.
18,4,0,So, you'd rather split than commit?
24,3,3,You're not alone, Mr. Thompson -- people tell ME that I'm not a real therapist.
19,2,1,I don't think my smoking you is going to help anyone.
32,9,6,No, Freud never mentioned 'banana envy.'
25,6,3,Do women actually fall for that?
36,4,0,Banana: Oops, that was a slip.
19,3,0,Honestly, I don't know why I split !
24,3,3,I see what you're doing! Peeling me with your eyes.
24,4,2,Alright Sigmund, sometimes a banana IS just a banana...is that what this is about?
18,3,0,Come out from under the coffee table and confront your feelings, Kong.
33,14,6,It's a common problem for bananas your age.
32,9,1,I feel guilty about the clown.
26,7,2,Firstly, it's unethical for me to date a patient. And secondly, you're a banana.
24,3,3,Your delusions have taken on a decidedly realistic character, Mr. Cavendish!
23,3,3,I'm sorry but as a professional I see my patients only in metaphor.
21,3,2,You've opened up, but I'm concerned you're starting to push people away.
16,0,0,As a peel, how does that make you feel?
19,1,1,Yeah, I get it, don't get them in a bunch?
27,1,0,I understand you want your father back, but he slipped someone. That's a first degree felony
19,3,0,Why don't you think you're appealing?
21,7,1,I was mishandled and bruised...as many of us were
32,5,1,Let's call it "a banana slip"
16,1,0,I'm feeling unappealing the last few weeks.
21,5,1,Not always. Sometimes a slip is just a slip.
18,0,0,No, Mr. Maharishi Yogi, get back here. That's not a banana split!
26,7,2,When did this feeling of emptiness inside begin?
20,5,1,How long was it after he slipped that you began to have these feelings of guilt?
17,1,0,So you thought the meant: we will see you on Sunday?
36,20,6,It's like a part of me is missing.
21,4,1,I just feel so empty inside
37,22,7,You show classic symptoms of an Edible Complex.
29,8,4,Can you elaborate on what you mean by "I seem to have lost touch with my inner self".
19,5,0,I feel empty, used up, cast aside. I may still have some appeal, but that's all I have.
22,2,2,I'm not falling for you -- that's transference talking.
15,0,0,So, why did your parents want you to go in a different direction?
18,3,0,I actually specialize in marriage splits, not banana splits.
18,5,0,No, I can't say I've had any patients just like you.
24,1,0,... and we knew you'd be confronting new challenges, post gender-affirming surgery.
14,1,0,Tell me why the peeling was so emasculating.
44,11,0,No one takes me seriously !
46,35,11,Now that you've opened up, we can start to make progress.
18,2,1,Now you're independent.
26,7,2,And then she tossed me out like I was a piece of garbage or something!
33,5,5,In your case, I'd have to say the emptiness you feel inside is justified.
36,10,7,Your problem is you blame yourself when others slip up.
23,6,2,The same nightmare again, being eaten alive?
23,5,2,You've slipped a little since our last session.
16,2,0,When did you first notice you're appeal to others?
26,6,3,I know you feel empty inside but please remember you still have a peel.
23,6,2,Yes, I can see how it would be very painful that you never got any of the acclaim that all your comedy partners enjoyed.
26,6,3,Do you feel life slipping away?
22,5,1,Tell me how you really peel
21,8,0,Being degradable doesn't give people the right to degrade you.
24,6,2,Tell me about your lunch date.
20,2,1,Stop staring at my legs, you filthy banananimal.
24,3,3,You can't keep putting yourself in those situations.
41,30,18,You appear to be suffering from an Edible Complex.
16,0,0,How long have you been feeling so empty?
28,8,4,So when did you first stop seeing yourself as appealing?
31,18,4,It's not uncommon to feel empty on the inside.
18,3,0,Yes, some feelings are more slippery than others.
25,6,0,I just don't peel very good.
34,12,7,You're missing the part of you that's been consumed. We call it an edible complex.
16,1,0,When did you begin to first think of yourself as a banana?
23,5,2,When did you first have this feeling that you're on a slippery slope?
19,4,0,You see doc, I think I'm losing my a"peel"
26,7,3,You feel empty inside?
30,10,4,When did you first feel that the people in your life were slipping away?
23,5,2,I understand you're not peeling very well.
35,5,2,Did you know your farmer?
20,6,0,I've been thinking, Doc. Maybe sometimes a banana peel really is just a banana peel.
16,1,0,You could always ask your cousin, Mr. Pineapple if he'll have you over for the holidays.
18,0,1,When I was I kid, I was picked on and ever since my feelings have been split.
15,1,0,So when did you realize you were male?
18,1,0,Were they laughing at you, or the man who slipped on you?
42,8,0,For the fifth time, I'm DR. ABRAMS, not "Chiquita."
15,0,0,You said you've been feeling empty?" "It hurt so badly when she left. All because she said I had nothing but sex a-peel.
24,6,1,A split personality is not out of the question.
26,9,4,Remember what Freud said: There are no accidents.
25,7,2,Tell me about the relationship before you split
19,6,1,You think you are what made Fueud slip.
27,5,4,Splits happen, bru.
25,9,2,Did you always know you were funny?
17,6,0,Do others often lay blame on you for their slip ups?
41,7,2,My dad was a real fudge-up. When I was ten, he split.
27,10,2,"When did realize that making people slip and fall made you happy?'
19,3,0,And why exactly do you feel no one finds you "a-peel-ing"?
21,7,0,Blender-phobia is my specialty.
20,3,1,You're suffering from a split personality.
6,2,1,You've lost touch with your inner self.
59,49,19,I think you experienced a Freudian slip.
21,8,0,So it seems like everyone is blaming you for their downfall?
22,1,0,I can feel people trying not to pigeonhole me, but they always slip in the end.
23,1,0,"So, you had another slip".
36,19,7,I'm sorry, I didn't have breakfast.
26,7,3,What matters is whether you believe our sessions have become fruitless.
34,12,6,So you think people are laughing at YOU when someone slips and falls?
20,1,2,Sometimes we overlook the simplest of explanations for our problems. The reason you feel so empty inside, Reginald, is that your father didn't show you affection as a child.
15,1,0,Hey, wanna switch seats?
17,2,0,It's hard for you to be taken seriously, as jokes referencing you are such low hanging fruit.
26,3,2,There is no such thing as a 'Freudian Slip'. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar!
21,4,1,So you feel like your life is slipping away?
21,6,1,Why do you think you enjoy making people slip up?
20,2,0,So why did you 'lifestyle path' choose to start on this type of slippery slope?
16,1,0,It's not your fault that everybody slips up when you are with them....you need to get over it ....and move on.
35,18,7,'Seems to me you're just not comfortable in your own skin.'
27,8,3,How long have you believed that deep down inside you were actually a starfish?
31,9,7,I can sense your feelings of emptiness, but let's try to focus on your ability to make people laugh.
30,7,4,But I find you very appealing...
38,15,7,I've lost my inner self!
29,11,4,Really, you must let go of the guilt. You're the one who keeps getting stepped on!
18,4,0,Look, you've got to stop blaming yourself for what happened to Principal Barker. You were a pawn in Billy's game, nothing more.
23,6,1,Why do you feel people avoid you and when did you start peeling this way?
41,28,8,That's what happens when you let people walk on you.
20,3,1,I feel so empty and rejected and just want to get back to my bunch.
21,5,1,Do you often feel empty inside?
16,1,0,You're safe here. But don't get up just yet.
29,6,2,Tell me more about these feelings of abandonment.
25,6,3,Maybe it was just a freudian slip?
31,8,0,So you don’t feel appealing?
18,0,1,I'm not your sweet kumquat.
30,9,5,When did you shed your inner self?
19,2,1,Is this because I said you're bananas?
13,1,0,So tell me...How long ago did he split?
20,3,1,Now, today, where do we start: your feeling that you're squeezed out, unnoticed or simply rotten?
20,6,0,I hear your arguments , but you must decide . No more split decisions.
22,5,1,Not only can I tell what part of you is missing, I can assure you it was delicious.
20,3,1,As your psychiatrist, I must warn you: You are on a "slippery slope."
17,0,2,So, you think it was a Freudian slip.
16,0,0,Did you say, you were once a flying tiger?
31,10,1,Don't take it personally. Chickens have been funnier than banana peels for a long time.
20,7,0,Tell me about that void you feel inside.
25,9,2,It's too soon to say if it's split personality disorder, but the diagnosis is appealing.
29,4,5,You seem to be suffering from a split personality.
22,8,0,Perhaps it was just a Freudian slip?
39,13,10,The split must have been hard on you.
14,1,0,Why, because I like to sit like this - but wait I'm the one who asks the questions. You won't slip this by me.
26,11,2,Zip it up, buster.
30,18,3,There was a bunch of us when growing up but we've all been split.
19,1,1,And you were saying,"You have appeal". Or was that a Freudian slip?
21,1,2,Don't be paranoid, you don't cause ALL falls!
29,10,4,You can't be so thin skinned.
18,3,0,Tell me about whatever 'appeels' to you ....
18,3,0,So, if I may summarize: many find you to be a-peeling, yet treat you like garbage. Do I have that right?
22,5,2,You need to find your inner piece.
15,0,0,Mr. Burger, don't be so literal about losing your case on appeal.
20,4,1,Everything was great in Costa Rica. Now I'm feeling somewhat discarded.
15,0,0,No. I would not like to slip away with you.
21,5,1,So, when did people start calling you passive aggressive?
21,4,2,It's because I was discarded that made me hurt other people.
29,10,3,When did you decide to change careers from health foods to comedy?
38,25,9,I understand you gave everything to a cream pie but it's time to move on.
21,8,1,Bunch therapy just wasn't working.
18,3,0,I've always had trouble revealing myself to people.
23,5,2,When did you start having this feeling of emptiness?
21,4,1,Oh god, he split on me....
21,5,1,So you feel that to be called "Chiquita" is sexist . . . ?
19,1,1,Please stop with the 'Freudian slip' excuse - you're consciously being offensive.
27,10,6,You may have a banana-split personality
18,0,1,I've been trying to remember my childhood, but my memory slipped.
28,13,2,So... She went ape over you?
19,5,0,Tell me how you peel about that.
18,4,0,You believe you've been replaced by a protein tablet.
18,1,0,Alright Howard, same time next week?
21,3,0,Tell me more about why you think you're not appealing.
24,11,1,Let's find the inner you.
24,5,3,Don't judge yourself. A bad split can be hard to handle.
19,1,1,Over and over I hear 'slip and fall' in my head.
16,1,1,We'll spend the next few sessions on overcoming the Freudian slip.
18,3,0,It sounds like you mistook what she meant by "split."
18,3,0,So, you feel like your life is slipping away from you?
54,12,3,Help me understand why your Psychosexual development is stuck in the phallic stage.
19,1,1,So you're saying you have regrets about having a relationship with someone less evolved.
14,0,0,So you're feeling kind of left out of the whole smoothie scene, huh?
25,4,3,Parents split; Sister’s a peeler; Brother’s bruised….We need to meet twice a week.
20,7,0,...so you feel empty on the inside...like something very important is missing...
19,1,1,It seems you don't have much to say about your split.
30,11,4,Chiquita and I split up again.
29,7,5,The guilt is one thing, but the lawsuits are insurmountable.
23,4,1,And why do you believe it is your fault?
22,5,1,How does this stereotyping as something to slip on make you feel?
39,16,10,When did you first feel like 'an accident waiting to happen.'?
21,7,1,Hmm, I'm getting the impression that you feel discarded and stepped on.
19,6,0,Freudian slips are the least of my problems.
15,1,0,Uhm....I think there is a misunderstanding here... I, I am a Jungian... not a Freudian...Definitely not a Freudian. But I will be happy to refer you... .
22,2,2,She keeps telling me I have a split personality.
70,6,1,How does that make you feel when they call you "old school" ?
32,11,5,And sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel.
30,6,0,Did you start to feel empty inside before or after the accident?
20,2,0,Don't blame yourself for other people's slip-ups.
18,4,1,Sorry, I am strictly Jungian.
18,1,0,What about the bee in your dream that keeps getting closer and closer?
19,0,0,Being the but of all those jokes must be challenging.
21,4,1,Doctor, I have this recurring dream of someone slipping on me while standing next to an open grave.
29,11,1,It must feel terrible to have everyone fall all over you
16,0,0,No, that's not all the skin you have in this game.
24,2,0,Thinking like that is a flippery slope, my friend!
24,13,1,To put it bluntly , you're both bruised and empty .
27,11,2,So, how did it make you feel when she slipped?
44,17,13,Let's talk about the incident with the gorilla.
20,1,0,Banana Bread? It's a sexual thing.
16,1,0,And that's when you let her slip away?
22,6,1,I can see now why your wife left you for a cucumber.
20,7,0,So when did you start feeling life was slipping away?
37,9,7,You can be open here.
22,2,2,I can only agree - peeling from the bottom is simply... inhuman.
25,6,1,Tell me what you mean by, "I feel like I've been slipping lately."
36,21,6,It's nice to see you really open up.
40,18,13,I agree. This is fruitless.
22,5,0,So what makes you say that you've been feeling empty lately?
19,2,1,With keying technology it was only a matter of time before the stunt work dried up. Have you looked into still life retraining?
20,5,0,No, I don't know where the banana went.
15,0,0,We can forget about mom for a while, I've got a whole new bunch of issues
18,2,1,So, tell me about this vegetable you were so attached to.
18,2,1,No, I'm not wearing a Freudian slip.
35,17,7,My case is being tried in the court of a-peel next week
21,2,2,It seems you still exhibit hostility about your childhood on the plantation.
15,0,0,Freudian slips I can analyze, I refer banana slips to Dr. B. Keaton.
24,11,1,I hear you saying you feel like an accident waiting to happen.
23,3,2,Why does nobody understand I am a plantain?
26,7,3,You may be irrational, but you're not bananas.
18,1,1,And sometimes I think I am a shelled nut.
29,4,0,Have you lost a connection to the inner you?
17,0,1,To counter your negative self-image, I want you to look in the mirror each morning and repeat, ‘I am appealing to others. I am appealing to others.’ Oh, wait—darn! Another Freudian slip!
34,13,7,You should use whichever bathroom you gender identify with.
28,2,5,So, you're saying it was not consensual?
31,12,2,Tell me about the first time you felt like your life was a joke.
17,2,0,Well, yes that is quite a breakthrough.
16,1,1,You're letting people walk all over you, Kyle, and that's a slippery slope.
19,4,0,It wasn't really Freudian, he just slipped on me and fell.
17,2,0,So I'm hearing that you have a fear of bringing others down
27,6,4,I am curious - yellow.
31,10,5,So... what I'm hearing is, it's one Freudian slip after another.
19,3,1,I've been missing my banana something terribly these last few months
25,7,2,So now you feel like the one slipping?
22,8,2,I've been feeling empty ever since my banana split from me.
19,3,0,So what happens after you slip into this other realm?
45,37,10,Does it matter what the rest of the bunch thinks?
42,37,8,Funny how you let that slip.
16,1,0,Transfruit Identity Crisis: "Am I just a lazzi biding my time or a mere Freudian slip waiting to happen?"
15,0,0,Very interesting, Mr. Smith. Now tell me how you really peel?
14,0,0,I think next week should begin peeling away the source of your transference.
16,2,0,You lack sex-a-what?
14,0,0,It's very difficult to communicate with you when you turn your back to me.
26,10,2,Interesting... this friend... A lawyer... You think he's just using you...
28,14,4,So you're not comfortable in your own skin...
15,0,0,I am just known as a "a piece of fruitcake".. what is your problem?
28,11,3,I think we're getting into slippery territory here...
15,0,0,musa acuminata! this abracadabra of last resort drawn from my bag of tricks! once edible feed stock regenerated, ye can wag once again in verboten fruitful glory. i strongly advise you lug a left handed monkey wrench to ban anna from devouring you.
25,9,2,Well, is it possible that he never would have been comfortable in his own skin?
28,10,3,So you feel empty inside, used and abandoned.
31,9,4,Now that we've succussfully peeled back the layers, you need to begin work on acknowledging you're a fruit.
18,4,0,Evasive, misleading, deceptive ... it doesn't matter how you describe it, the fact is you've been acting slippery lately
21,5,1,You have to stop blaming yourself.
16,0,0,Feeling empty? Something missing? I wish we talked before the surgery.
25,4,2,I may not look like Freud, but I know a Freudian slip when I see one.
20,8,0,Tell me more about that dream where Freud steps on you...
16,1,0,The emptiness will fade. It's nothing more than a stage.
16,0,0,The time has come to heel.
20,3,0,Look, I understand that you're feeling empty inside. But it's no reason to let your life slip away.
31,7,0,And I told her, 'You know, sometimes a banana is just a banana.'
32,8,6,You need to stop blaming yourself for others' slip-ups.
15,1,0,Stop, you've peeled enough layers, there's nothing left.
15,0,0,Have you ever heard the phrase "passive aggressive?"
18,3,0,You shouldn't blame yourself, the accident sounds like it was caused by a Freudian slip.
15,1,0,Yes, let's go back this "hopelessly empty" feeling you've described having since the judge denied your re-peel.
20,7,0,My whole life has been a joke.....
24,2,2,You likely would've had a better result with group therapy.
20,3,1,Don't give me that Freudian slip routine!
16,1,0,Chiquita, the question is why did he put you in the refrigerator?
17,2,0,Freudian slip and falls are normal.
18,4,0,We can't all be universally appealing.
34,11,7,You have appeal, but you seem to be lacking substance.
19,1,0,So you feel guilty about causing thousands of people to slip and to fly through the air and land on their backsides.
20,4,1,...and you think subconsciously you wanted him to slip?
17,2,0,Can you believe that my last therapist had the nerve to accuse me of being slippery?
25,8,2,I just feel so discarded and stepped on.
20,3,0,Textbook split personality.
23,6,2,Forget me. Let's stay focused on you and how you jazz up your own damn corn flakes.
15,0,0,Your libido is on fire?
19,1,1,I'm just a shell of my former self.
32,11,5,Sometimes splits can be messy.
42,26,9,Tell me more about your life on the street.
19,3,0,I mean, I know I'm appealing and she tells me she she loves me for what's inside. So why do I feel so empty?
20,1,1,Every time the psychiatrists' convention is in town, I make a Freudian slip.
21,5,1,What do you mean, you'll slip up one day too?
17,2,0,Oh now, everyone slips up from time to time.
13,1,0,Peeling away the layers will get you to the fruits of your labor.
16,4,0,"I constantly feel rejected".
17,2,0,So why do you think others find you so unappealing?
14,0,0,What makes you think people need you to slip up?
22,3,2,Maybe it's just transference, but I find you appealing, too.
37,20,7,I understand you feel empty at your loss of sexual metaphor.
28,11,3,So, you feel your career has been limited to slapstick comedy?
21,1,0,Tell me again about the nightmare where you wake up underwater and can't breathe.
21,5,1,So explain to me again why it's NOT what's on the inside that matters...
27,13,2,Yes, those brown spots are a sign of aging, but you were still good on the inside.
29,13,2,Analysis is all about peeling back the layers.
26,7,1,Looking at it positively, he may have left you but you still have a peel.
47,31,13,It sounds like we're dealing with a classic Edible complex.
20,3,1,Splitting is a common defense mechanism.
20,1,1,This is progress. You've learned how to express your peelings.
21,4,1,Let's begin with your Herbaceous phase.
17,1,0,Do you have insurance?
16,0,0,How long have you felt that you were just someone's "punch line"?
18,1,1,You are too yellow and too slippery for psychoanalysis: but I'm the Top Banana around here.
17,1,0,I have deep concerns about the degree of slippage you seem to create.
21,1,2,I'm not peeling well.
21,4,1,You say you used to be hilarious; OK, let's work on that.
21,2,1,I’m glad you’re comfortable discussing your peelings with me, but you’re bananas if you think I’m going to go out with you; mixing personal and professional relationships is a slippery slope, and besides I don’t find you to be all that appealing.
25,4,3,Your gender re-assignment procedure appears to have been a complete success.
28,12,3,I just feel like people are always stepping on me.
28,6,3,Let's talk now about peelings and emotions.
23,5,2,From what you've told me in our sessions, you may suffer from split personality disorder.
31,7,5,Sorry, that was a Freudian slip.
23,9,2,I understand, but sometimes a banana is just a banana.
26,12,2,And when did you leave the bunch?
26,11,2,Why do you believe only clowns fall for you?
36,16,7,Have you considered compost?
16,1,0,Oops! He left...
22,0,1,(Writing) Banana feels like focal point of blame and is tired of people instantly pointing their fingers to him after hilarious or stupid slips, trips, and/or falls.
8,2,1,Do you think that was a freudian slip?
16,0,0,And when did you first become a vegan?
30,11,5,Well . . the apple didn't fall far from the tree either
17,3,1,So you feel like part of you has been missing ever since the incident with the gorilla?
27,5,4,You pay on a sliding scale.
21,2,1,Actually, I see quite a few bananas.
15,0,0,You gave her the slip and how did that make you feel?
20,3,1,I'm just a shell of myself
18,1,0,So it's the strawberries & banana thing?
18,1,0,Why do you think you're drawn to slippery slopes?
16,1,0,And just like that the Grauer Gorilla was gone.
38,12,3,I just feel so empty inside since we split.
36,17,8,Yes, I can charge on a sliding scale...
26,2,0,All said was, Your attraction to neanderthal types is perfectly natural.
13,0,0,I agree. The black upholstered chain has appeal. Now what?
19,4,0,So, she told you to split?
34,13,7,What's eating you?
17,1,0,When do YOU think everyone laughs at you?
14,1,0,My feelings were hurt when the whole bunch said I wasn't appealing.
19,2,1,Is that what you expected to happen?
19,0,1,Why do you think you lack appeal?
18,0,1,I don't know doc, but I peel like a banana.
16,0,0,How long have you had this feelings of rejection?
23,4,2,We all feel empty from time to time!
26,10,2,You say you're feeling empty inside?
14,0,0,Please, no slippery shibboleths
36,3,4,I can't date my clients sweetie, its slippery slope.
23,9,1,No need to feel embarrassed...the whole world has gone bananas.
18,0,1,What you're suffering from is a banana-split-personality.
18,3,0,I'm afraid we are on the slippery slope, Mr Cranston.
18,0,2,By now, don't you think the fruit-vs-vegetable conflict is perhaps a moot point?
42,6,11,Once you go black, you can never go back.
24,11,2,I used to be green with envy. Now look at me.
52,42,15,You seem to bruise easily.
46,28,12,Would you feel better if we used the expression ‘Going nuts’ instead?
17,2,0,Now that you've calmed down I'll change you back.
24,9,2,So he slipped. People laughed. It’s not really your fault.
26,5,3,So slapstick comedy felt patronizing?
20,2,1,Mr. Dole? What happened? Did you take the blue pill an hour before your date with Chiquita like we discussed?
22,6,1,Believe me, I know what it's like to be stepped on.
21,6,2,Now let's discuss why you let people walk all over you.
63,51,22,So what's eating you this week?
32,4,1,She took my properties and dumped me.
24,6,1,The wrong people just keep falling for me.
22,6,1,You may be experiencing split personality.
20,1,1,I told you I don't go out with my patients, not even for "just a cup of coffee." It's a slippery slope.
17,4,0,If you're going to let people walk all over you, at least make it hurt.
17,3,0,I can certainly see you're a peel.
64,59,25,Success is not measured by the number of people you bring down.
19,3,0,Tell me about the clowns.
68,51,34,Do you need a moment to compost yourself?
15,0,0,I didn't think he'd go that far back into his past.
16,1,0,When he peeled you off, he didn't say he was coming back?
27,5,0,Sometimes you just have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start 'em fallin' all over again.
15,0,0,And how do feel when they call you "banana face"?
16,1,0,It's extremely common to develop feelings for your therapist. I'm going to recommend another doctor for you to visit." "I was literally inside you five minutes ago, Jill.
17,2,0,All my friends seemed to have slipped away.
18,1,1,It takes a lot of courage to bare yourself like this. I respect that.
18,4,0,So, things started coming apart after the split ?
37,4,0,This is carrying a Freudian slip too far.
19,4,0,You've really gone bananas this time
16,0,0,So your banana split to be with a bad banana with a...greasy black peel?
26,1,3,Yes, you could say we both make a lot of 'bread'.
18,3,0,Why do you think your feelings are so easily bruised
22,5,1,I'm afraid you're suffering from a severe case of split personality disorder.
20,5,0,It's no wonder your mind was in the gutter...
23,4,2,So it is the feelings of inadequacy and lack of recognition for making the actual Freud slip...?
16,1,0,So tell me why do you think you are feeling depleted.
24,3,3,I don't think he meant disrespect by calling you 'chiquita.'
17,2,0,whats wrong in your life?
28,6,4,So, did the Viagra help at all?
29,5,4,Your life has to be built on more than appeal.
16,1,0,Okay...let's talk about Bobo.
35,13,7,...and sometimes a banana is just a banana.
16,3,0,When did you first feel the urge to lie down on pedestrian crossings?
18,3,0,I'm just the shell of what I used to be.
19,1,1,Fermenting is a dead-end
33,11,8,It's perfectly normal that you feel empty inside.
22,4,2,Tell me more about this obsession with composting.
22,11,1,How did you end up on skid row?
28,11,3,I don't think the fear of being composted has a name.
18,4,0,Let's slowly peel back your emotions.
24,8,2,I feel like there's a part of me missing
19,4,0,I keep waiting for a Freudian slip from you.
20,4,1,I just feel like they just keep stepping on me.
15,0,0,What feminism does to america
27,3,4,Interesting... When did your parents split?
23,3,3,I had foster parents.
19,2,0,I'm afraid our time is up. You'll need to split.
26,6,3,Clearly, you're suffering from a split personality.
19,5,0,For this therapy, we simply peel the layers to see what is inside . . .
20,2,1,You need to stop suppressing your desire to stand out from the bunch.
31,13,4,If you were a fruit, what fruit would you be?
39,7,5,I am so sick of being called Chiquita!
37,15,8,I am afraid this discussion is just fruitless.
20,6,0,How did you really feel after she slipped?
27,8,3,I'm going to slip on something more comfortable.
23,6,2,Do you suppose it's the loss of your inner self?
17,1,0,Now,, tell me how your really peel. Now, tell me how you really peel. [put really in italics)
14,0,0,Being chosen last in the fruit bowl won't necessarily happen again if you try out for the stick ball team.
44,32,10,Even empty and discarded, I find you appealing.
27,8,3,I can tell by your filthy thoughts you've been hanging around with a rotten bunch.
17,2,0,Lie back down on that couch or I end this session right now!
41,16,9,So was it a tough split?
23,6,2,What makes you think she purposefully left you behind?
20,6,0,I know, I slipped up again!
14,0,0,Get with the flow doc, spread out..
21,1,2,Sorry, but I get hungry after I cum.
16,1,0,When you are with your vegetable friends, do you frequently feel misunderstood?
25,5,2,Tell me about your relationship with Chiquita.
32,16,4,Your fear of being 'tossed aside' is not an irrational one.
19,2,0,No I dont like that word. How about I fantasize about you gliding on me from time to time.
33,19,4,You say she offered to make you a daiquiri?
37,2,2,' How long have you had these slipping sliding nightmares?'
19,2,0,We started dating after he represented me in a slip and fall case . . .
22,2,1,I know you have come a long way, but size does not determine my fee.
23,10,1,You need to stop dating all these low hanging fruit.
17,0,1,My soul was rotten...
20,3,1,I feel like I get blamed for every fall, Doc.
15,0,0,Maybe if I stare at this banana long enough, it'll turn into the mother I knew
19,5,0,Why do you think it is your fault?
19,2,1,Throughout our therapy sessions, you sure have peeled your soul to me.
17,3,0,From another perspective, your comedy brings a lot of joy to people.
15,0,0,Looking inward is the way to deal with these feelings of emptiness.
22,2,2,Let's talk more about your peelings…
17,2,0,Tell me when you began to feel life slipping away from you.
28,8,3,How long has The Name Game been your favorite song?
26,8,2,My mother took me to a zoo once; I haven't been the same since.
20,6,0,How long have you felt so hollow?
28,11,2,I dunno...I just feel empty all the time.
16,1,0,I should have worn more sensible shoes
18,4,0,Yes, sometimes you cause people to slip and hurt themselves but it's not your fault and you mustn't feel any guilt.
26,9,3,So tell me when you started feeling so empty inside.
16,3,0,So, you're here because he said your entire family was bananas.
26,11,2,How do you feel, now that you've opened up so much?
17,3,1,So when did you start feeling that you had lost your appeal?
43,12,13,You're definitely not completely bananas.
9,1,0,Will that be all, sir?
20,3,0,You may have lost your bananas but you are still appealing.
19,4,0,That all depends on how you define the word 'split'.
37,7,0,Uh-huh, and when did you feel you were slipping?
31,12,5,Not everyone can be top banana.
25,13,1,Every day I wake up, I feel like an accident waiting to happen.
21,4,1,Sometimes a banana is only a banana. And now our time is up.
67,7,1,I peeled when my banana split!
17,2,0,You are headed down a slippery slope.
18,0,1,tell me...were you rejected when you were a seed
11,0,0,How long have you felt like you're out of touch?
24,6,1,Why do you think you're so prone to Freudian Slips?
16,1,0,Now I understand why dreams of oral sex were so terrifying for you.
31,6,2,We need to start by peeling back the layers in order to uncover the problem
20,6,0,Perhaps you are enabling the poor treatment by allowing others to step on you.
30,8,5,Stop blaming yourself. It was a Freudian slip.
35,12,7,You have to stop allowing that type of comedy define you
15,1,0,Doctor, you gotta help me. The comparisons to Trump's hair are really getting me down.
22,7,1,Slips happen
19,2,0,do you self-identify as split?
15,1,0,So...you identify more as an apple, but still prefer bananas. I have that right?
42,19,10,"Everyone slips.
32,5,3,How did you feel after being discarded?
19,1,2,I don't find my life as appealing as it once was.
22,2,1,Let's work on picking yourself up.
31,17,4,You can't be discouraged because not everyone falls for you.
33,1,1,Are you feeling guilty because you thought it was Freud?
19,1,0,You are what you are, Musa, a banana. Look it up!
22,1,1,So when did your fantasy about being stepped on by Hillary Clinton start?
18,2,0,We already tried light therapy.
21,6,1,Chiquita, it's not your fault. But it is your problem.
24,2,3,Tell me more about Costa Rica.
18,2,0,People keep getting tripped up with me.
25,11,2,Tell me, when did you first feel this emptiness.
25,11,2,I'm always the fall guy.
18,3,0,...and then she just split on me.
31,1,0,It's not your fault ... IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!
26,4,3,What I'm hearing is that you're uncomfortable with maraschino cherries.
14,0,0,I see them all—starlets, star makers, and now...starfish.
18,4,0,You've got to watch out for those Freudian slips.
27,9,3,You use humor to deflect the pain of your inner emptiness.
18,2,0,'..and you blame yourself?'
41,12,11,Well, with it completely gone I suggest you simply increase the foreplay.
22,7,1,You can't blame yourself for that accident.
22,10,0,So, you split?
23,2,2,I sense an alienation from your inner core.
15,0,0,Maybe this could be a painting!
16,1,0,Tell me why you don't like being called appealing?
16,1,0,Interesting. You say a monkey has given you this empty feeling.
28,12,3,It's a classic case of separation anxiety.
26,7,3,So, you and Cherry decided to make the split?
33,10,7,You don't understand, doctor. I've hurt so many people.
22,3,2,You slipped up.
17,0,0,I just don't get no respect!
26,6,3,You expect me to fall for that line?
27,8,3,Let's focus on being less under foot and more in hand.
25,4,3,Was this the first time you opened up to someone and got hurt?
57,42,18,Just tell me what's eating you
24,5,2,Aha, when did you start feeling "empty?"
23,12,3,You know, not every slip is a Freudian slip.
19,2,1,I think I'm finally getting under that skin of yours.
16,1,0," So you say she quit seeing you after she ate you"?
32,13,7,Feeling a little empty inside?
25,6,2,Your problems stem from low potassium levels.
34,5,4,A Freudian slip you say...
29,13,0,You have a thick skin.
28,8,4,Tell me about your peelings.
19,3,1,OK, Why are you here today?
23,4,2,Girls fall for me, Doc. I'm tellin' ya. One slip and they fall for me.
25,4,4,I’m sorry but even without that part it's unethical for me to date a patient.
16,1,0,So because you're empty inside, you're the butt of people's jokes?
29,2,0,Tell me about the things in life that you find appealing.
19,5,0,Accidents happen. How you deal with them is what matters most.
23,8,1,Any regrets about your trip to the jungle?
19,4,0,Normally I like to explore your inner child, but in your case I can see that will be a problem.
15,1,0,Piecing together your issue, I highly doubt that plastic surgery would be the answer...
19,1,1,I'm going bananas getting stepped on all of the time,... I bruise easily.
15,0,0,Every week, you come in here and tell me that you think people are laughing at you behind your back. Get over yourself.
18,0,1,a banana a day keeps the patient away,,,
15,0,0,Tell me more about your Mama.
20,0,2,What makes you think that you are not appealing?
24,9,2,I want to help peel back the layers.
33,5,3,How have you felt like a joke.
35,5,9,Of course we're all stereotyped. Look how they drew my legs.
23,4,2,They put you in the refrigerator? That's cold!
20,9,0,What would you say is missing?
22,7,1,What made you think you could slip that by me?
20,7,0,I'm sorry but 'Going Bananas' is not a billable diagnosis.
27,9,3,No. I don't think you're nuts; but you may be bananas
24,8,2,Have you always been thin-skinned?
25,4,2,So, you say you are splitting up?
15,0,0,Before we start, I think you should know I'm more of a Jungian anal-ist...err!
20,3,1,This is your third session with me and you still haven't said a word. I know what happened to you was difficult, but they put that gorilla in a zoo. He can't hurt you anymore. It's time to heal.
15,0,0,"So, you'rean exposed fruit,so what"?
21,0,0,Tell me, how did you feel when to be slipped over? And the previous time?
40,5,0,Actually I think we've made great progress.. Remember when you started coming in?
39,24,8,There used to be a whole bunch of us that hung out together . . .
23,0,3,I just don't find life appealing.
14,0,0,I see you're getting aroused. Is it this discussion about your days on the stalk - or are is it my short skirt?
16,1,0,You like split personalities. We know you do.
45,20,13,I'm terribly sorry. I skipped lunch.
25,4,3,What shall we address first, split personality or your empty feeling?
43,15,11,So people walk all over you, and others laugh about it?
16,1,0,First it was 'you fruitcake!' and now it is 'you, fruit!!'.
20,4,0,I'm sorry if my lunch ate into your time.
29,5,0,Please turn over. You're spotting the couch.
16,2,0,Too many suitors? I can see your appeal.
16,1,0,In my professional opinion ; Your appeal notwithstanding , you're a peel and quite bananas . Own it.
21,0,1,So, you are not peeling very well?
17,0,1,Theres nothing funny about being a doormat.
18,4,0,I understand you work for Slip and Fall insurance company
19,3,1,You're so much more than the descendant of a movie prop.
19,2,0,I have a reoccurring dream that I am on this slippery slope.
12,0,0,But see the thing is, I would never consciously partake in a Freudian Slip. I was just laying on the ground minding my own business and the next thing I know....
27,5,4,Sometimes I just feel like such a joke.
35,2,0,I'm looking for a therapist with real appeal.
28,1,0,I just don't understand why people always tell me that I lack a peel.
18,0,1,Your recurring dream about a cigar... How long have you been having it?
21,4,1,At least you still have your peelings.
32,13,6,So your last psychologist diagnosed you with split personality disorder?
33,9,0,I'm tired of being the butt of everyone's joke.
16,2,0,I guess it all started when I saw my mother in a slip.
22,3,0,I'm hoping we can peel back the layers and get to the root of the problem.
22,3,1,Separation anxiety is very common among your species.
25,5,1,Tell me, how long have you been feeling unappealing?
23,8,1,And why do you think she no longer finds you appealing?
18,1,0,You two really need to split up
21,1,2,And how did you feel when the heel hit you?
23,1,0,I know he is no good for me, but he appeals to my baser instincts!
18,3,0,Whew. Is it hot in here?
34,20,7,What am I writing down? My grocery list.
25,9,1,Doesn't tripping people seem like a passive-aggressive way of managing your feelings?
55,5,4,I think I know why you're attracted to the octopus!
24,6,2,You have banana envy.
22,6,1,You're a banana for God's sake. People are supposed to use you up and then throw you away.
15,0,0,I'm a chili pepper and I'm hot for you.
21,7,0,Does anybody else in your family have the same problem?
18,0,0,So, your wife really said, 'I slipped up when I married you!'?
17,3,0,My life's a total joke!
20,5,2,I'm simply suggesting that sometimes a banana is just a banana.
32,9,6,So your wife split?
18,3,0,Sometimes, I just feel so empty.
26,10,2,Try to remember: they're not laughing at you, they're laughing with you.
20,3,0,You're so much more than just a peel.
16,1,0,Your responses are all quite slippery.
21,8,0,If you feel like a vegetable, it does not necessarily mean you're schizophrenic
21,8,0,When did you first begin to experience this feeling you were slipping?
30,9,5,Any issues other than experiencing an empty feeling?
21,3,2,Yes, but why do you worry you won't be taken seriously?
28,10,3,Every time I get close to someone I split
28,9,4,I did warn you that we would peel back all the layers.
21,7,1,I just don't understand comedy anymore.
16,3,0,So your banana split you for a sundae?
27,9,3,How long have you felt this rotten?
19,5,1,Why is it only clutzes who fall for me?
19,3,0,So, you feel guilty about the part you played in the Freudian slip?
15,1,0,I have this obsession about causing Freudian slips
20,3,1,What makes you say your appeal has slipped?
23,9,1,How long have you felt like an avocado?
17,2,0,I have literally busted my ass on your case.
20,3,1,Let's revisit the recurring dream of Elvis slicing you and putting you on a peanut butter sandwich, How did that make you feel?
18,0,1,Oh dear! I don't think I will get any help from Jung or Freud on that one.
15,2,0,Then he just pealed me open, it was awful it still haunts me now...
21,10,1,When did you first feel this emptiness?
22,6,2,How do you feel when called a fruit?
23,7,2,The fact that people keep blaming you for their slip-ups should not make you paranoid.
28,3,5,Sometimes I think I'd be better off bread.
20,3,1,You're walking the slippery slope again, you know.
23,2,0,My hemline has nothing to do with your Life's Purpose...only with the fees you're paying.
24,6,2,Can you tell me exactly what you mean by "appealing?"
16,3,0,When did you start to think you were slipping?
15,2,0,…and then you unzipped me…and then you smothered me in whipped cream…and then you stuck in a sweet red cherry...and then you licked it off…and then you plunged me into your mouth…and then you sank your teeth into me…
22,8,1,When I said, "let's peel back some layers," I did not mean physically...
18,3,0,Wanna' slip on something more appealing?
23,4,0,Let's see if we can get deeper than the feeling that you're "slip, sliding away."
26,7,2,I'd like to discuss what happened at the zoo.
21,5,1,Freudian slip duly noted.
20,6,0,So - you don't find it funny anymore?
16,1,0,At times we all feel stripped, empty, and that we cause others to slip up...
18,1,0,How do you get out of the way in time?
27,11,2,People keep stepping on me like it's a joke.
17,1,0,...go on, why does it appeal to you?
18,6,0,Have you ever had this feeling of complete emptiness before?
31,7,5,Sometimes everyone feels like a joke.
18,3,0,Tell me more about this slip-up problem you've been having.
20,6,0,I would ask how things are going, but I see we are headed down a slippery slope.
15,0,0,I am afraid that once you peel off all the layers we will find that I am just an empty shell.
34,9,3,Plastic surgery just isn't an option for your condition, it would be fruitless.
16,1,0,I've always been unamused at clowns slipping on me.
36,19,6,You have to come to terms with the loss of your inner self.
16,1,0,I have always been mistakenly associated with a great number of slip accidents
17,0,0,Let's talk about all those years watching your mother sabotage your father.
41,26,9,Let's talk about the 800 pound gorilla that used to be in the room.
19,2,0,Orange you glad I didn't say apple?
19,1,1,He said he didn't find me appealing anymore
29,8,3,It's normal to feel that you've lost your inner self at times, but I'm afraid it's permanent in your case.
14,0,0,I have a green office, not a green thumb.
39,4,2,Yes, I understand your appeal.
29,15,2,So you feel you were labeled?
16,1,0,Sadly, the couch holds little appeal for her these days.
17,4,0,The Fosters, The Cream Pies, the Splits...all signs of a masochist.
34,14,6,Since Chiquita left me I feel empty inside
27,3,3,Screw doctor-patient relations, you are appealing.
27,5,4,I'm sorry, I charge by the hour, not the pound.
18,1,0,And how did you feel, when you realized that the banana-skin recycling market had collapsed?
18,1,1,I understand how you must puh... feel.
26,5,3,Sometimes a doctor falls for the patient, but you aren't appealing to me.
20,4,1,Now, tell me why you and your wife split.
56,30,20,My last patient was nuts.
16,2,1,You are one banana, not bananas.
20,3,1,Let's discuss your Freudian slips.
19,5,0,Sometimes, Mr. Mini, as Freud said, a banana is just a banana.
17,2,0,Your dreams about your mother stepping on you is what we call a Freudian slip.
15,2,0,Yes, I find you appealing , your a real smoothie.
23,4,2,You can't keep blaming yourself.
17,2,0,So why do you say "just" a banana?
34,15,6,I always feel like an accident just waiting to happen.
18,4,0,What do you think it is about you that trips people up?
37,10,3,When did you first feel like you had lost your appeal?
22,6,1,I never realized how much it took out of me to get that monkey off my back.
23,5,2,Okay... you met the gorilla your dreams... and then what?
14,0,0,Have you shared with your agent that you're tired of physical comedy?
29,7,4,Fine. And how do YOU peel?
17,2,0,Tell me more about this sidewalk compulsion...
28,3,0,It is a slippery slope dreaming that you are the banana that everyone slips on.
20,7,0,So, I see you have lost your inner being. Tell me more.
21,4,1,If it makes you feel any better, I ate you for more than your flavor.
18,3,0,Then I told her "hey, you slipped up, not me".
22,6,1,Tell me about your parents' split.
30,11,4,I've been stepped on my whole life.
20,6,0,Finally we are ripe for discussion
19,1,1,What makes you feel like you've been torn apart?
23,2,0," Due to patient confidentiality, I cannot discuss the Onion and it's may layers. You, on the other hand, only have one.
27,10,2,There's only so long you can hide the bruises
28,15,2,I see you're still grappling with the recent split.
12,0,0,No, you're not at all appealing in that way.
15,0,0,Well ... Yes, Freudians slip but they generally don't fall down.
19,3,1,Being bananas doesn't qualify you for running for president.
21,3,1,Your absolutely ripe.
22,9,1,You should try to be more thick-skinned.
18,3,0,I'll split with you any day.
20,1,1,Why so miffed? All I said was 'Sometimes a banana is just a banana.'
27,9,3,And why do you think you feel empty inside?
26,10,4,When did this empty feeling start?
26,7,2,Maybe it's time for you to accept that marbles are just funnier.
15,0,0,Nobody believes or trusts me when I say: "I'll always stick by you."
17,1,0,He'll never get better if he doesn't take his peels.
16,0,0,How does your job affect your self-esteem or your sense of guilt?
22,5,1,Was that a Freudian slip?
31,4,1,I don't care what you and your bunch think. I find the label Chiquita offensive.
24,9,1,'So, you've just split with your better half'.
21,4,1,So tell me, Mr. Cavendish, what's eating you today?
28,12,2,...and then she said, "or are you just happy to see me...".
19,4,1,Listen Slick, one more "cute little old lady falling for me" and we're finished.
21,9,0,After what you've experienced I'm not suprised that you feel empty inside.
19,2,1,I feel like I'm always slipping up when I'm around people.
25,4,2,Not to worry, it's slip covered.
16,2,0,Lately I feel as though my life's path is a slippery slope.
28,6,3,Why do you believe you’ve lost appeal?
20,2,0,I feel as though everything close to me slips away.
14,0,0,I get it - 'a peal' - but climb back down and throw it out.
21,7,1,Don't make me laugh!
25,12,1,You're right, it is a slippery slope.
22,3,2,50 years since “Mellow Yellow”... . forget about being a sudden craze
21,9,0,I'm afraid if I split, I'll just become another cliche
19,2,1,I think you've finally reached the stage of acceptance.
25,7,2,You're comparing apples to oranges.
19,2,1,Cliché? You're going to whine to me about being cliché?
21,3,1,You are a model character for separation anxiety.
16,1,0,Therapy is not about consuming yourself, but leaving yourself vulnerable to others.
21,2,0,I am sick of slapstick comedy I want to do something more dramatic!
27,10,2,When did you start feeling empty?
17,2,0,This new paleo diet seems rather strict.
40,26,8,How do you mean, you feel like an accident waiting to happen?
20,4,1,Every slip isn't necessarily Freudian.
19,1,1,Don't be so hard on yourself, you're all appeal.
22,3,2,Mr. Peel, calling your entire family bananas does seem like a Freudian slip.
25,13,1,You said yourself that monkey was just using you.
32,15,5,How long have you had this fear of composting?
25,2,1,I don't feel guilty if it was a Freudian slip.
17,2,0,I pealing low, I'm not getting the jokes I ones got.
18,4,0,How old were you when your father split?
22,4,1,Now, about those slip-ups...
25,9,2,I'm going to recommend a Jungian colleague of mine.
78,52,35,You can't go on like this. You're an accident waiting to happen.
33,6,1,Interesting, but I do hope my therapist shows up soon.
19,7,1,When did you start feeling unappealing?
18,4,0,That's a pretty slippery slope you're on, Mister!
22,3,2,Would you mind if I leave first?
19,1,1,I just have this feeling of emptiness
37,20,5,I think what we're dealing with is a split personality.
19,7,0,So you find yourself unappealing?
24,1,1,'Gee, I would enjoy this banana even more if I didn't have to take off the peel,' said no one ever.
19,2,1,So tell me when did you lose yourself?
22,7,1,We have to end there. I have a desert island coming in at 3:00.
20,3,1,Psycho analyst, not bananalyst.
22,7,1,I didn't think the split would affect me this way.
17,2,0,I feel like people just walk all over me.
15,0,0,Who put this banana's peel here?
26,11,2,And what makes you think people have been avoiding you?
19,4,0,That's quite a litany of complaints: you feel cast aside, you smell rotten, you're yellow, and you feel responsible for people slipping and falling. I think you may suffer from situational anxiety.
19,4,0,It sounds like a bunch of Freudian slips
13,2,1,I'm just curious, which fruit recommended me?
27,4,1,Let us talk about that Freudian slip.
17,1,0,Well, I guess that could be a valid argument for abstinence only sex education....
18,4,0,Are you bannanas!?! I'm married!
17,2,0,No, I don't have a fear of slipping in heels. I sit like this for all my clients. Really. Now let's talk about you.
23,4,2,Even though you say you feel empty inside, she cannot deny you're a peel.
36,15,4,It appears that you have a banana-split personality
33,9,6,When did your father split from the bunch and how did that make you peel?
22,1,1,Your appeal? Only skin deep.
26,14,1,Seems like you're ripe for a change.
21,4,1,For me, it was love; but he only wanted my flesh.
20,6,0,So how would you describe your appeal?
18,3,0,I was born a berry but transitioning as a fruit
16,1,0,Have you considered that maybe people are laughing WITH you and not AT you?
22,9,1,I'm afraid you're suffering from what we call a banana split personality.
20,5,1,How long have you felt like a joke?
25,11,1,Tell me about life after the split.
25,1,1,He didn't use his hands Rachel!
20,3,1,One at a time. Please.
14,0,0,Don't worry. We all have times when we feel less a-peeling to others.
22,1,2,I appreciate what you're saying. I just don't find you appealing.
19,1,0,The aftermath of a Freudian slip.
18,3,0,You might want to reconsider your position. It is a slippery slope you are on.
26,5,3,You were ripe for a loss.
17,0,1,After being chewed and spit out by monkeys, then tossed about by clowns, your future really is rotten.
17,0,0,So when did you first have the idea that you 'd like buildings and casinos named after you?
22,2,1,Well, my father was from a strict organic family, while my mother was a plantain. So I guess I'm a banana split.
19,1,1,...and THEN they put me in the refrigerator!
24,10,1,I see. How does that make you peel?
15,0,0,Apparently, you're just hollow inside.
32,12,5,I've felt empty ever since the split.
29,13,3,And now you feel empty inside?
15,0,0,I hear you and I understand. Simple fruits can be complex under the skin--you peeling back will make this a productive session.
23,5,2,I just feel like something is missing inside.
26,7,3,Maybe people are laughing with you, not at you?
24,8,2,We all slip up sometimes. Forgive yourself and move on.
15,1,0,Sometimes I think my wife is a hat.
23,1,3,"I've been feeling better about the split, but I can't get over the fact that she just took everything and tossed me out the window like a banana peel".
15,1,0,I don't find myself appeeling
17,2,0,Success.
29,9,5,It's natural to feel discarded from time to time...
18,5,0,I told you the flesh was weak.
21,4,0,...I feel like these days everyone is just waiting to give me the slip.
17,3,0,You do understand that when you say you want to "slip me one" it's called "transference", right?
18,4,0,Hmm...identity issues ? Before we begin, are you Dole or Chiquita ? You all look the same without the sticker.
20,2,1,Therapist: "Split up!" Patient: "But I love my apple!"
18,5,0,You think I'm crazy, don't you?
51,24,17,Can you tell me where the monkey touched you?
20,4,1,Your diagnosis is split personality.
26,10,2,Don't let him treat you like garbage.
18,2,0,Nobody has stepped on you in three months? Wow
29,21,3,So, you gave everthing to this Daiquiri?
45,25,11,You say you feel you're an accident waiting to happen?
27,10,4,I feel so empty on the inside
15,1,0,2 masters degrees and a phd and this is where is gets me, taking to a bunch of bananas
14,0,0,..and when he fell everyone laughed and laughed but I just felt really sad for him. Am I depressed?
30,10,5,In retrospect, we should have discussed the 800 pound gorilla
22,3,2,As Freud said, 'Sometimes it's just a banana....
30,7,0,It's not your fault he had one foot in the grave.
22,3,2,This feeling of emptiness, is it after the slip and fall?
28,6,4,Did you just call me Chiquita?
22,0,0,So, besides all the Chiquita stuff, what else makes you afraid of refrigerators?
18,2,1,You can't just wait for things to fall into place.
22,10,0,Well, none of us want to feel like we've been stepped on....
15,4,0,How long before you knew you were on a slippery slope?
19,3,0,I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE LOST YOUR APPEAL. I THINK YOU HAVE SIMPLY GONE BANANAS.
14,0,0,Let me get this straight, your boss told you that you were fired... and THAT'S when you went bananas??
17,3,0,It pains you when they say you are in cahoots with orthopedic surgeons?
29,11,3,So, people don't fall for you?
21,4,1,I'm tired of always being the fall guy.
22,8,1,Whether or not I find you appealing is hardly the point here...
15,0,0,So, making people fall down helps with your post-partum depression?
18,3,0,Tell me how you felt when you peeled.
19,4,1,When did you begin to feel like a second?
28,9,4,Have you considered that maybe it's not you that they're laughing at?
75,52,32,This is fruitless.
28,9,4,So... you feel like you're constantly seen as some kind of joke?
34,10,1,Actually I deal with quite a lot of banana splits
22,6,1,So you say you felt hollow, empty, like a shell of what you once were...
28,11,3,I certainly understand why people keep falling for you.
17,3,0,You've got to work on becoming more thick-skinned.
22,6,1,You don’t think you’re appealing?
19,3,0,That's what we call in the profession a Freudian slip.
22,7,1,How do you mean, "empty"?
22,6,1,Oh... that's not normally what is meant when you say your wife wanted to split.
20,2,1,I keep dreaming that you need a big hit of potassium.
16,1,0,Nothing really appeals to me anymore.
31,7,5,You have an inedible complex.
22,6,1,Tell me about the split, again.
26,0,0,Tell me more about your fear of losing grip on reality...
28,8,1,You need to find a thick-skinned role model.
25,2,0,Yes, I'm sure slippery guilt is hard to deal with>
32,11,1,Okay. So you're tired of being set up as the fall guy.
17,0,1,All the other banana peels get slipped on, but nobody wants to slip on me.
16,2,0,Do you feel that way about all vegetables?
22,3,1,You say you find me appealing...
17,2,0,Don't let your fear of being eaten destroy the happiness of today.
15,0,0,Please help me Ms, it just made my skin crawl, when I realised I was let with the vegetables.
23,10,1,You need to find your center.
17,2,0,So that's what you call a Freudian Slip.
24,5,2,A man stepped on you...go on...
16,0,0,So, Mr. Starr, how long has your marriage been on the rocks?
16,2,0,What made you guys spilt up?
22,0,0,Don Tr***, we know your size, STOP peeling off!
25,7,2,What makes you think they were laughing at you?
27,2,0,So just where do you get this sudden compulsion to peel?
14,2,0,Is there any particular time of day when you feel as though you are a banana peel?
26,3,4,No, I believe Freud said sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
14,0,0,I am just trying to peel away some oyour problems.
17,2,0,When did you begin feeling others slipping up on you?
19,3,0,So believe you have a thin skin.
17,2,0,..and that's when I realized it was me who was slipping on them
18,5,0,Can we move this along, I gotta split.
18,2,0,I see you've begun to peel away the layers to find the fruit of your issue.
21,3,1,And why do you feel you have lost your status as a phallic symbol?
17,1,0,Going bananas's worse than bonkers
25,7,2,All right, Norman Vincent, let's get started.
14,1,0,So, you are saying that it made you go bananas that she called you 'honey' and then dumped you?
23,5,2,It wasn't your fault-she slipped and fell!
15,0,0,Yes i hear you please tell me why you want to go naked in public.
18,4,0,Do you think you were meant to be a zucchini?
42,6,3,'Tell me more about how you think the chimpanzee was using you in your relationship.'
26,2,1,"Now that you've taken responsibility, you have to learn to forgive yourself".
32,10,6,The last thing I remember was how cold the ice cream was.
20,1,1,Maybe if you were less slimy, people wouldn't step on you so much.
23,3,0,I was just one from a giant bunch. Fighting my way through this cruel world with ambitions to be the Big Banana.
20,3,1,Let's explore these feelings of loss and abandonment.
15,1,0,Let's talk about your tendency to slip into patterns.
22,6,1,Unfortunately, split personalities run in your family.
27,6,4,It’s not your fault you were the only survivor of the bunch.
30,9,4,I'm so sorry. It must be difficult to no longer be a sex object.
15,1,0,I thought you got your slip already.
35,8,2,What do YOU think the tailpipe dream means?
27,6,2,No wonder you feel guilty again. How often have I insisted that you stay away from sidewalks?
21,6,1,As Camus said, we must learn to live without appeal.
40,12,2,And how did it make you feel when he treated you like discarded trash?
20,3,0,I'm afraid low humor doesn't enhance appeal.
57,36,20,It's "Oedipal", not "Edible".
20,1,0,Even Cruz blames me for his campaign having one foot in the grave.
20,1,1,you are! appealing and well adjusted; we'll have to deal with the fruit or vegetable thing next time.
22,1,2,I recommend getting in touch with your inner plantain.
20,6,0,Therapy just never seemed appealing
18,0,1,We have to address your doormat complex.
16,0,0,You're looking a bit peel, is there something more I should know?
20,4,1,Tell me more about your struggle with 'split' personality.
18,4,0,I feel like I'm going down a slippery slope.
28,12,3,And how are you taking the split?
21,6,1,Of course your best years are behind you. But, you can still make people laugh!
19,3,0,You've peeled back the layers but you continue to slip.
21,3,1,Honestly...I'm just sick of sharing the chocolate with that cold hearted vanilla.
31,11,2,"I know I keep slipping up and bringing people down with me".
21,1,1,My id couldn't make it.
31,9,5,When daylight come and he wan' go home, how does that make you feel?
24,7,2,I think the problem is that you have a split personality.
27,8,2,Now, does this emptiness you feel hit you before or after lunch?
24,11,1,So, when did you first notice you felt so empty inside?
17,0,0,Cheetah! Come back! You didn't pay me.
28,10,3,he left me for a gal named chiquita
15,0,0,Your case has no appeal for me.
27,9,4,Let's focus on the day he left you for a smoothie.
13,0,0,'Paranoid? People take one look at me and begin to laugh.
27,9,1,At what point did you realize you were going bananas?
18,3,0,Literal or Freudian?
33,14,4,Just relax, Mr. Peel, and tell me what’s eating you.
18,3,0,How long have you had this sense of rejection?
15,1,0,Hey, you may think it's ok to look up a lady's skirt when you're on the sidewalk but not here.
28,7,3,I think it's split personality disorder.
18,4,0,Why do you think you're decomposing?
24,10,1,Tell me more about your transition out of comedy.
23,4,2,Look on the bright side. You've still got appeal.
47,37,13,Of course, we all ask ourselves at one time, if a fruitless life is worth living.
25,5,1,Sometimes I feel like I'm the one slipping
48,19,15,He was such an ape, he just ripped me open and took what he wanted
21,8,0,Ever since the split, I feel like my insides have been eaten out.
21,3,1,We agree your life in slapstick is over. I think you should go into composting next.
20,1,1,So -- deep feelings of emptiness followed by bouts of hysteria?
15,0,0,Apparently neither of them is properly licensed.
48,22,15,Of course it hurts when you open up fully and then just get tossed aside.
24,6,2,I want to be a serious actor, but people just walk all over me.
33,12,6,Why is it so important that people know you're a plantain?
47,30,12,So, you feel like a phony because you lack substance, but you still have appeal?
30,1,0,Trump said I looked fat but it was in a re-tweet; where does that fall?
27,2,1,Maybe they're not laughing at you but with you.
23,4,0,I know this might seem unprofessional, but I just seem to find you more and more a-pealing...
37,13,8,Oh, no, no - "low hanging fruit" is just a metaphor.
23,7,1,You lost a part of yourself that day, so it's not uncommon to still feel bruised from the experience.
25,7,2,Surnames are not destiny, Mr. Peel.
22,4,0,I'm aware that the word 'slip' discomfits you, but I am talking here of the Freudian variety.
25,4,3,You haven't mentioned your parents.
26,6,3,Has the fact that you didn't get a blue sticker been eating at you ?
17,4,0,How long have you felt that your mind was slipping?
18,1,0,Let's talk about your childhood.
17,4,0,Just to be clear. When you say "then she split", you do mean left you ?
16,1,0,Envy of potato skins is perfectly normal
24,6,2,Sometimes a plantain, is just a plantain.
41,9,11,I know exactly what it's like to be used by a big ape.
24,2,2,Let's discuss how you keep slipping toward me on that couch...
19,5,0,Then they accused me of making a Freudian slip.
16,1,0,Well that's an unappealing position to take.
19,5,0,Your sense that you lack appeal may be related to your feelings of emptiness inside.
29,9,4,No one deserves to be stepped on.
15,4,0,Well, if your partner lacks appeal, perhaps you should just split.
27,10,2,What I hear you saying is that you feel unappealing!
26,14,1,Everyone tells me I still have appeal, but I just feel empty inside.
44,5,6,First of all, Streisand was singing Feelings not Peelings.
20,6,0,It sounds like someone used you and just split.
26,6,2,And how long have you had this feeling of everyone wanting you to be stepped on?
18,3,0,That's not what I meant when I said time to split.
40,16,6,So, you think I'm appealing, too?
27,8,3,So, you feel like you're not all there? Empty inside?
17,1,0,So, you think people are stepping on you?
17,2,1,Tell him he can't eat the fruit, then just throw away the peel.
12,7,0,How long have you felt this emptiness?
24,3,3,What's this about Harry Belafonte?
26,3,0,What was growing up like with a red mother and a plantain father?
21,1,1,How long have you not been feeling like a star?
25,4,4,I see this could lead to a Freudian Slip
15,0,0,Trust in your brown spots. You're ready.
16,1,0,You seem to have lost your appeal.
20,9,0,I think it all started when my parents split
15,1,0,It might have been juvenile, but I was making people laugh. Now, I am a bad retired joke.
16,1,0,Everyone accuses me of making them slip and fall but that's a myth.
19,3,0,He gave me the Freudian slip!
18,4,0,I could see how a sudden split would make you go bananas
30,6,5,When did you decide that you wanted to transition into being a Plantain?
18,1,0,Don't be delusional. Of course you are a peeling.
66,53,24,And how would you say you're handling the split?
39,18,11,When did you first begin to feel that your life was fruitless?
30,11,4,Tell me, what's been eating you up inside?
18,3,0,I have a great feeling of emptiness inside.
22,4,1,How did you feel after the split?
33,2,0,Well,... I ...didn't think it was funny!
20,0,0,You really are a naughty banana.
29,9,0,Thank you; I find you appealing too.
15,0,0,i use to be part of a huge great bunch . but since my new owner selected me. i have become a one off munch ..
18,3,0,You're ahh peeling... I mean appealing.
31,29,5,Honestly, you need thicker skin.
24,3,3,So how did that make you feel when you got stepped on?
33,3,6,It's what's inside that really counts.
23,3,2,No, it's not a cliche to feel emasculated
46,20,13,You have appeal, but you seem to lack substance.
24,4,2,I just feel like everything is slipping by me!
26,11,2,It's hardly egotistical for YOU to think about bringing Trump down.
40,17,9,But it’s not like they’re trying to step on you….
15,1,0,You are, most certainly, an early bloomer.
20,1,1,Did you say 'pear or pair'?
24,0,1,Try to look past the pain of being peeled to see that it opens an exciting new chapter in your life.
31,4,1,I feel so empty, slippery and empty.
20,3,0,Nooo! He's building a wall in Mexico Chiquita!
17,5,0,How did that make you peel?
22,6,1,I won't give a group rate for a split personality.
15,0,0,Why am I the only fruit which grows vertically in lieu of hanging dowm?
21,5,1,Oh, I misunderstood. My receptionist said you were a *fried* plaintain.
20,3,1,Why do you always get the bigger chair?
18,3,0,I know you're depressed since you're no longer not top banana, but I think you still have appeal.
16,1,0,I want to to break up with you Tom I have already ate you there is no point of a banana that has already been aten.
24,2,2,Tell me about your Freudian slips.
42,10,4,Looks like it's been an hour. Time for you to split.
47,21,6,This is good, this is very good, you're starting to open up now.
18,8,2,You ARE empty inside.
36,9,6,I used to be young, ripe, and full of life, but now I feel like things are always slipping away from me.
17,0,0,Taxes give many people anxiety.
30,8,5,I'd like to address this extreme paranoia you have about ending up on Skid Row.
16,4,0,so why do you think the others in the bunch don't appreciate your sense of humor?
23,9,1,I guess it all started with Orange and that damn knock-knock joke...Why? Why are people glad he doesn't say Banana? What does that say about me?
23,5,2,Do you feel guilty about making so many others slip up?
20,5,1,And when did you start feeling like an objective correlative?
27,6,3,We call that a "Freudian Slip."
31,5,3,Do you see now, that its not your fault they slipped?
19,4,0,I don't think an antidepressant is really going to fix your problem.
30,5,2,So tell me again why your parents split.
21,7,1,If we're going to solve your self-esteem issues, you're going to have to stop letting everyone walk all over you for a quick laugh.
26,4,2,And then, I just got up and split.
27,5,3,I can see your appeal.
19,3,1,I'm just a shell of what I once was.
22,3,0,Why do you think you have a "slippery" feeling?
15,4,0,Do you think they are laughing at you, or with you?
39,27,12,How's it been since the split?
30,3,1,We've been over this a million times. I don't know why she doesn't find you appealing
30,8,5,I think I'm a grape.
31,11,6,How does that make you peel...I mean feel?
27,9,3,You need to stop letting people walk all over you.
25,8,2,Of course you're not bananas!
26,7,1,And how did it make you feel, being the youngest of six?
19,4,0,So tell me, what makes you think you have split personality disorder?
25,2,0,I feel that your sanity is beginning to slip.
18,3,0,. . . and you think I'm appealing?
16,3,0,Do you make like a banana and split in every relationship?
24,3,3,It might be something as simple as having 'Low T'...
40,14,11,Perhaps it was actually a Freudian slip.
17,1,0,You need to forgive yourself. If somebody slipped on you and got hurt, that's not your fault!
28,3,5,Premature evacuation happens to everyone.
31,10,5,So people step on you?
24,2,3,Tell me more about your mother's split personality.
41,13,6,Banana-fanna-fo-fanna-fee-fi-fo-fanna----and this was a game he would play with you?
16,1,0,Can you tell me about the guilt?
18,1,1,I feel hollow inside, incomplete, a slippery joke.
22,6,1,He just made like a banana and split.
15,0,0,[HUH? I just today received my New Yorker depicting birds and hunter!!! For which my submission was: "Gun nuthatch!"]
45,28,9,Do you feel comfortable in your own skin?
21,4,0,You're completely normal, I'm a little worried about myself though.
14,0,0,At least you won't slip up on one.
17,4,0,So when she cut off your inner banana and tossed it into a smoothie, you just split?
20,3,1,I think you're just paranoid, everyone isn't trying to give you the slip.
23,2,0,Why do you feel he is una-peel-ing?
21,7,1,So this sense of being used has left you a shell of your former self
21,1,2,So, your feelings of abandonment make you want to hurt people?
16,0,0,I'm sorry. It just came out that way.... that you really are just a cigar.
21,9,0,You say it feels like everyone in your life keeps slipping away?
22,9,1,Daylight came and he wanna go home.
26,9,3,Is being organic really that important to your self esteem?
36,16,7,I'm sorry, 'it's what's inside that counts' is just a saying
22,2,0,....and the Donald said I'll turn you into a banana peal
26,8,3,...and why do you think people are laughing at you?
17,1,0,So the constant bickering is driving you...you?
21,5,1,I think I know just the thing to help with your feelings of emptiness.
20,4,0,I feel so discarded.
23,5,2,You fear being purposely thrown down so someone can slip on you?
18,0,1,On Skype, someone will know you are a peel
18,3,0,That's a bit of a role reversal, usually you cause people to slip up
35,13,8,I just feel like life is slipping away.
36,6,5,"Tell me again about the "... are you just happy to see me?" joke.
30,6,0,The key is to not slip back into old habits.
14,0,0,She's helping him not 'Rot Out'
18,4,0,Don't go bananas on me! You've been through these split-ups before.
20,3,1,I believe you should concentrate on potassium not phallicism
19,5,0,I'm so sorry to hear about your parents' split.
29,9,4,You say your wife split and your life is slipping away?
15,0,0,Is it appropriate to pursue my dreams?
21,5,1,Size doesn't always matter.
36,15,7,You'll fall for me someday. They all do, eventually.
18,0,1,Let me guess—you're blaming Freud for your troubles again?
22,3,0,I said 'slippery'. It's a clinical term.
20,1,1,I get the slips and falls, but you can't blame yourself for rise of ISIS.
48,18,15,We split up on a Sundae
17,0,0,lets address who you seem to be feeling empty inside
19,3,0,Why do you think I find you appalling? You are actually appealing.
19,5,0,I see that you grabbed hold of that potassium-deficiency suggestion from our last session.
17,2,0,I don't particularly enjoy being stepped on, but those belly-laughs I get are my only bliss.
41,16,5,Sounds like a tough split but I'm sure you'll find another bunch to hang with
44,2,1,Yes, the outside is viewable but you're here for the hidden core
20,3,1,I don't think Dr. Freud was thinking of you when he was talking about Freudian slips!
20,1,0,Maybe look at this way, the thing about being a peal is that you are still a survivor.
26,9,1,For the last time, that's not what "Freudian slip" means.
23,5,2,Let's work through your guilt feelings about the fall.
23,5,2,That's just your paranoia, not everyone thinks you're a joke.
31,8,3,What's been harder, the slip or the split?
28,7,4,So,tell me again about growing up in the Republic.
21,5,1,It was a difficult split and I know you may never get over it, but I'm sorry to say that's how sundaes are made...
31,12,5,Please try to pull yourself together.
18,1,0,It seems like you turned over a new leaf when your parents split
26,7,4,Let's explore these feelings of emptiness.
41,25,10,I can only help with the Freudian slips.
25,4,2,You’ve got to let go of the guilt. They’re supposed to slip on you.
52,4,2,Let's get back to your dream of making my husband slip and break his pelvis
21,5,1,My wife says I'm no longer her top banana.
20,2,0,So, nobody has ever slipped on you and this has disturbed your id?
27,2,0,When did you first start feeling people were giving you the slip ?
28,6,0,Are you planning a freudian slip?
37,7,10,I've been empty inside ever since the split.
17,2,0,So how are you peeling today?
16,1,0,Three days on the street and not one person slipped!
25,3,3,I'm in a funk. Sure I've got a tough exterior, but I'm completely empty inside.
22,0,0,Unless we deal with your constant need of being the Top Banana, you will slowly peel away.
15,0,0,Everything seemed to fall apart after the surgery.
23,5,2,Yes, I find you appealing. Is that wrong?
22,5,1,No, I am not a Freudian. Why do you ask?
20,2,0,``Let me stop you right there. In case you haven't notice, I'm a banana, not an onion. So let's not go the `layer' route, OK?''
17,1,0,It's like I got one foot already out the door.
33,1,3,He used to call me "appealing". Now, it's "appalling".
18,3,0,Let's peel away your recent experiences
16,1,0,A banana for your thoughts
20,5,1,How do you feel about people falling all over you?
26,5,0,I didn't mean to step on you. It was a Freudian slip...
19,4,0,I'm sorry but my lawyer said not to let anything slip."
24,11,1,So you just let people step all over you?
23,8,1,How do you expect to have any friends if you're always giving them the slip.
26,5,3,I forgot to mention the side effects .
15,2,0,So, what you're saying is that everything leads you down a slippery slope?
29,6,3,You have to come to terms with why he split.
19,1,1,She said I lacked a certain appeal.
27,11,3,Any idea how many people come in here claiming to be the fall guy?
16,1,0,Why do you need my help since you are the perfect food?
16,2,0,"Do you still feel stigma from the time you were a fruit?
27,8,3,So you told him to stop monkey-ing around, and then what happened?
20,1,1,I'm sensing an unusual amount of friction from you today.
63,40,21,So you feel like you're empty inside?
15,0,0,Did I just see a gorilla got off that lounger and left a banana peel on it?
19,2,1,I've lost touch with my inner banana.
38,9,1,You are afraid of monkeys and have penis envy!
18,1,0,I thought this one might be monkeying around with me.
24,6,3,Being rejected by Chiquita is no reason to feel you've lost your a peel.
17,2,0,I guess I never realized that you were skinned alive.
17,4,0,True progress, Chiquita. You're starting to peel away the layers.
20,7,0,Why do you feel ice cream shops are the cause of your split personality?
20,3,1,I always feel rejected
19,2,1,So you feel an emptiness inside?
18,2,1,I just don't feel like I'm funny anymore.
21,2,2,You have to move past this. People slip on things all the time.
19,3,0,I think you feel you have no core inside.
40,8,0,So, he used you, threw you away........o.k I get it ...then what happened?
16,1,0,And when did you start feeling like a couch potato?
29,10,3,So where did we leave off? Oh, yes. You feel empty and ripe for change.
28,5,0,You need a Freudian analyst
21,5,1,You need to stop tripping people up.
17,2,0,Perhaps injuring people is beyond your control.
24,6,2,Lets discuss your split personality.
18,4,0,Tell me how you made Dr. Freud slip.
25,13,1,Naturally, you're moving from separation anxiety to grieving a central loss.
18,3,0,If I'm the subject of one more Freudian slip, I swear, I'm leaving the profession.
28,5,4,She decided I no longer appealed to her so last Sunday she split and hooked up with a fast-talking plantain -- a real smoothie.
18,4,0,I'm sure people are laughing WITH you, not AT you.
29,5,3,I'm so tired of being blamed for everybody's slip-ups!
17,1,0,This type of behavior will eventually leave others hurt.
18,0,1,Ridiculous! I am not trying to seduce you - I just happen to have perfectly shaped legs.
20,7,0,And how does being cliche' make you feel?
21,2,0,He dumped me to get another banana.
20,7,0,And when did you first notice everything was slipping away?
26,0,0,So you're saying, he's back in rehab and you feel like you're the slippery friend
34,13,7,So, you feel like an accident waiting to happen?
19,3,1,I'm flattered, but let's talk about what makes YOU appealing.
18,4,0,Please walk me through the split again.
21,8,0,I can't believe I fell for you.
29,9,3,It's no longer called a split personality.
25,7,1,So you blame yourself for that man's slip-and-fall?
34,15,4,This business of you just lying on the floor is very passive aggressive.
40,10,4,So, how long have you not been peeling well?
22,6,1,So you pursued a comedy career to compensate for your feelings of being discarded. Tell me more.
21,3,1,Why do you think you keep slipping?
17,1,0,Ok, Ok, I know I should be over the appeal jokes. I just seem to trip on it every time.
36,10,8,Unfortunately, our time is up for today-O. Your fears of tally-man will have to wait.
15,0,0,I thought, "hey, he wants to eat healthy for once." Instead, he put me in the microwave. The husky teenage boy I live with would never use an apple pie. He just wanted a warm place to put it. He'll do it again, Doc.
18,5,0,So, why do you feel 'used'?
29,6,4,Maybe daylight has come and you can't go home anymore.'
30,5,4,Thank you, you're a peeling too
18,2,1,I keep thinking I'm a potato.
36,4,0,Organic? Of course not, he had a very conservative world view.
24,5,2,Yes, it's a very slippery slope
30,3,1,And then she told me...that i wasn't ripe enough, so i split.
26,5,2,I guess you are not happy to see me.
22,3,1,What happened after he fell down?
18,1,1,You just think you love me.
17,0,0,What things in your life do find unapPEELing?
16,1,0,Let's talk about your inner child.
22,3,1,You're making too much of phallic symbolism -- and my gender is irrelevant.
12,1,0,I didn't say your mind was THAT slippery!
17,3,0,There's no "coulda" "shoulda" "woulda" in slapstick.
18,2,1,You have to quit blaming yourself. The accident wasn't your fault.
20,4,1,That plum job can still be yours.
21,1,0,I've been specializing in bananas for years. But, you are the first suicidal banana I've met.
23,0,0,Tell me again what's keeping you from taking the next step and sliding?
22,2,2,You're only bananas when you're with the rest of your bunch.
26,2,2,So what makes you think you're going bananas?
17,2,0,With a slip, one is too many and a thousand not enough.
27,10,3,People think you're slippery, how does that make you feel?
20,3,0,You shouldn't feel inferior. You have lots of ap-peel.
15,1,0,Just because you are slippery doesn't mean you have to try to "trip" me up!
19,6,1,Yes, I find you appealing, but you know it's unethical of me to say so.
24,9,1,My diagnosis is that you have a split personality.
21,4,1,No more weddings.
14,0,0,Why do you think they call you a bully?
18,1,0,Be the joke. Own it. J
24,11,1,How do you feel about vanilla ice cream, crushed nuts and whipped cream?
21,3,3,Are you afraid he’s seeing other peels?
51,35,15,Try thinking about it from the chimp's perspective.
19,1,1,You call that a Freudian slip ?
23,5,2,My parents split.
20,1,1,You really feel you lack appeal???
15,0,0,I propose you're using a defense mechanism we call 'banana splitting.'
17,1,0,I get it, monkeys are scary, and no one likes to be stepped on...but have you thought about how painful it must be for others to keep slipping and falling on their ass?
21,4,1,And why do you think that your life is slipping away?
19,2,1,You have to stop blaming yourself if others find you unappealing.
21,9,0,Why do you think it was a Freudian slip?
19,5,0,Okay, you're sessions up. Time to split.
28,10,3,People slip up. It can't always be your fault.
25,7,3,"It wasn't your fault. He was probably distracted and slipped. I see this a lot".
28,14,2,Why do you blame yourself for other people’s slip-ups?
23,4,2,It's always what's on the outside that matters.
21,5,1,Well, I'd call that a classic Freudian slip.
22,3,2,Yes, it's hard to get over a split.
27,5,4,No, I don't want to slip into something a little more comfortable!
17,1,0,Do you always feel that you are about to injure someone?
21,8,0,Well, this is some troubling symbolism.
17,1,0,SO YOU FEEL EMPTY JOIN A SUNDAY
18,3,0,Why shouldn't they step on me? Obviously, something's missing.
27,3,4,You should stop blaming yourself.
15,0,0,"So your depression is caused by a lack of serious roles, since you've always been type cast in comedies".
24,10,1,How long have you felt a danger to others?
38,10,9,But how did it make you peel?
26,9,3,No, Ted. You're not a piece of garbage.
30,8,5,When did this fear of causing an accident start?
40,17,6,And now you feel used?
29,9,3,Your wife's reason for the divorce is that you were an accident waiting to happen?
14,2,0,Guess he ran out of cereal again
16,1,0,Your prognosis is appealing.
30,13,6,Let's talk more about your split personality.
20,3,1,Anger management-wise, you let too many people get under your skin!
19,1,1,Indeed, your 'haunting sense of disembodiment' certainly sounds very interesting, but I'm afraid that we're just about out of time.
21,1,2,George, I knew you were slippery.
24,8,2,I'm glad you're being so open with me.
23,9,2,Sometimes I feel people only care about what's on the inside.
26,8,3,I have never felt so empty.
44,10,4,Tell me more about these dreams....the ones with the "tally man."
33,12,6,And it was after he stepped on you that you started to feel empty inside?
25,10,2,Could it be that you're still grieving after the split?
21,4,1,So you had a slip up...
15,1,0,So your having split decisions?
27,5,1,Perhaps you'd feel more appealing if you stopped making so many banana puns.
18,2,0,Let's start with why you believe Mr. Trump is obsessed with you.
21,4,0,14 grams of sugar, you had no choice.
15,1,0,I know you're more than just a phone.
55,3,1,I just want to establish some background on what has happened to your inner feelings before we begin.
14,0,0,Yeah, I got it. What's the punchline?
18,4,0,because it's funny when they trip and fall ?
17,2,0,Very clever, Mr. Carlton. No, I haven't seen your banana.
19,2,0,Actually, I often wear a stalk of limp asparagus in my hair. Think of at as a conversation starter or even an homage to your Kingdom.
34,10,7,That's not what we mean by Freudian slip!
36,11,8,Orthopedic surgeons love you .
21,4,1,You're claiming that you're responsible for the Freudian slip?!
22,3,2,Split personality ?
21,7,0,Do you fear you might enjoy hurting the people that step on you?
18,2,0,I don’t know what it means, but I keep having this dream of people stepping on me and slipping.
17,2,0,I've been told I have an unhealthy attraction to shoes; by the way are yours Jimmy Choos?
26,7,3,Tell me what led to the split.
20,3,1,You’ve got to stop dating these clowns who walk all over you and then act like it’s all a joke.
35,7,8,.......and when she split, did she also take the cherry?
31,8,1,All right now. I think we've had quite enough monkey business!
20,3,0,You don't feel whole anymore? Let's explore that.
16,1,0,"Bananas patient, bananas peels on bananas couch. I am quitting".
18,5,1,What eats you?
28,9,4,I watched my parents brown right in front of me
20,3,1,I can understand you're feeling used.
32,19,4,He left you for a sundae-let's start there.
26,7,3,Yeah, I was hanging in there for a while. Now... Not so much.
24,4,2,No, I wouldn't say you're not appealing.
18,3,0,Clinically speaking, you've clearly gone bananas.
15,0,0,Now were saying, you're a former maid?
17,1,0,My parents are both high achievers. No room for slip ups.
15,0,0,Honest, I'm not a slippery individual.
27,5,3,Looks like you've already peeled back the layers.
21,9,0,Elaborate on how you and your bunch slipped across the border.
15,0,0,It was traumatic. Nana never let us socialise with other bananas, and put a sign in the window. We called it Nana's Banana Ban Banner.
42,6,1,So you think you and nuts have both been stereotyped?
19,1,1,My expierence with Banana's like yourself, is that there's more than meets the eye,
20,7,0,I don't understand, Doc. I just feel empty inside.
16,2,0,Why do you think he split?
33,3,1,Ah yes: that empty feeling, that empty feeling....
37,2,0,Tell me more about this recurring dream. Did you feel responsible for the man carrying the cake falling? If so, what change in your behavior could have prevented his dropping your ex-wife's wedding cake? Go...
24,10,1,I think you misunderstand what a Freudian slip is.
16,3,1,Yeah, sometimes life does feel like a slippery slope.
27,11,2,I am afraid you are suffering from a split personality
29,8,5,the problem is your appeal
21,9,0,He left you. How does that make you peel?
23,8,2,I identify myself as a peach, so I should be allowed to use the peach bathroom.
14,0,0,Do you blame yourself for her slip?
20,2,0,My humming "Yes, We Have No Bananas" doesn't mean I have countertransference issues!
17,0,0,So, this is what we have so far: 'I just don't feel like I've got enough inner fruit'...
32,7,0,I actually think your fear of abandonment issues are well founded.
16,2,0,You're going to have learn to stop blaming yourself.
19,1,1,And tell me why you don't feel appealing anymore?
19,4,0,I seem to be losing my appeal.
21,7,1,You still miss your inner self?
20,6,0,You can choose to focus on what you've lost, or you can focus on the happiness you've brought to others.
19,2,1,Can you elaborate on your feelings of emptiness?
15,1,0,Freudian slip? No way - peel off!
18,2,0,And how was your relationship with Luigi?
17,3,0,Things were terrific until I got fired during his quest to appear more presidential.
19,2,1,...as if the joke's always on you.
19,0,1,And so, I think I hear you say you have appeal.
25,8,2,No, I'm afraid this will require more than Viagra®.
17,2,0,So you hear dime a day Willie Loman saying, "You can't eat the fruit and throw away the peel" - in no way does that total loser invalidate your worthiness as a banana peel.
45,18,14,Tell me more about the tally man.
24,10,1,So, how do you feel about your split?
36,13,8,He slipped. It's not your fault.
22,4,2,I don't know how to tell you this, but that whole 'getting eaten' thing was not a dream.
34,0,0,Lucky he's in his blind spot.
38,7,0,Relax, I'm organic.
24,4,2,I feel so used.
18,1,0,So, this feeling you have of being always being the punchline to a joke, Where does it come from?
15,0,0,You could probably get wealthy working at the next campaign debate.
20,2,0,When did you first feel the onset of this split personality disorder?
15,0,0,No. I've never has a Banana Split Sundae.
25,6,2,Was it a nasty split with Chiquita?
38,13,10,So...your job at Banana Republic wasn't what you expected?
18,2,0,We've got to deal with your feelings of bitterness next time.
18,3,0,It's not unusual for a banana peel to want to be an octopus.
20,3,1,Why do you think the family ate you?
26,6,3,It wasn't your fault
19,3,0,Damn genie said I'd be TOP BANANA!
18,1,1,And how does it make you feel when he blames you?
47,3,2,"So you feel that this split can be contributed to your being cut down in your prime, your separation anxiety from the bunch you grew up with and the cause of a near fatal clown fall".
20,5,1,Pleeeese, stop with the Freudian slip jokes! I get the irony.
29,5,1,Even if you are appealing, you can't expect everyone you meet to fall head over heels.
27,3,1,So you feel like you're always being stepped on...
18,3,0,Well, Marvin. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
16,1,0,Nothing in you character is appealing, why do you think your appealing ?
30,12,4,What did the monkey do next?
29,10,4,So people are always taking the fall for you?
27,12,3,I'm going to have to ask you to zip yourself up.
25,4,1,I feel unappreciated.
18,1,0,How long have you felt that people treat you liked a used-up fruit?"
21,4,1,It's so difficult for me to peel back any more layers
16,1,0,I'm sorry I can't see you anymore but I'm limiting my practice to vegetables
26,6,3,You have banana split personality syndrome.
24,4,2,I tend to lead to people's downfall.
28,5,4,When did you first notice people avoiding you?
17,4,0,Just remember, tragedy plus time equals comedy.
17,2,0,I'm not judging you... a fruit is a fruit.
28,17,2,Two days ago you noticed brown spots.
23,0,2,There's nothing Freudian about your fear of slips.
25,9,2,It is my fault she slipped out of my life.
18,2,1,So why do you think Jane Goodall ruined your family life?
14,0,0,I know it's a slippery slope but you must talk about it to get your footing.
15,0,0,Ok.... So after being served with the slipping personal injury lawsuit, you say it's left you feeling a little yellow.
34,9,1,You're upset over your split!
19,2,0,Based on our work here today, I'm recommending to the parole board that you're not yet ready to reenter society.
21,2,2,It's not what is your problem, but what are you?
21,8,0,How long has this been eating you alive inside?
41,14,10,So, any slip-ups since our last session?
33,14,6,How long have you self-identified as an apple?
27,10,4,So what is worse, when people step on you, or avoid you all together?
17,2,0,So your partner split. How did that make you peel?
25,11,2,You're right. I don't think it's funny.
13,1,0,I am being replaced by kale!
25,7,1,And how did you feel when he called you a fruit?
18,2,0,When was the first time you felt yourself slipping?
19,0,1,Despite my arrogance I still have appeal?
22,5,1,I know you are feeling slippery right now but its just a phase.
23,6,1,She used me up, left me empty inside and just threw me away, Doc.
29,6,1,So how did you slip up?
18,4,0,You seem a little slippery, but there is an a-peel-ing quality about you.
13,0,0,Easy for you to say, you weren't born with a monkey on your back!
36,8,8,I'm sorry I misdiagnosed you as nuts.
47,9,4,I can't stress it enough but your empty feeling has nothing to do with your mother.
25,12,2,I actually do find you a-peeling!
19,3,0,Tell me how you feel about being peeled from the wrong end?
30,10,5,It's what's inside of you that matters.
15,0,0,Lance, first admit it was cheating.
18,2,1,There's just something inside I feel is missing.
20,6,1,You can't peel back more layers, or you won't?
19,0,1,And yet you seek Jungian therapy?
14,0,0,The narcissistic banana had a selfie addiction and no longer found himself apeeling.
27,4,4,I'm not denying your appeal, but I am your doctor.
31,9,5,next time I want to talk to both of you
21,4,1,Don't blame yourself! He took a Freudian slip.
25,7,2,It can certainly be a burden when people keep falling for you.
21,1,2,Can you tell me why your not feeling comfortable in your own skin ?
15,0,0,Um OK: Slippery relationships, change happens quickly, you never knew your mother. What else?
17,2,0,Does he remind you of anyone, this big gorilla you say you see outside the window right now?
28,10,2,I think you lost your identity with all that knock knock stuff
55,26,19,OK..... I'd like to go back to that time in your life when you tried to form a republic
28,9,3,Ok, so how did it make you feel after you found out your mother was a plantain?
18,3,0,I feel like I've lost my center.
18,2,0,No wonder you make slip-ups.
32,3,0,So, did you actually make a plan to dive into the compost?
18,3,0,So you're glad you're not an orange?
27,2,5,A Freudian slipped?
26,5,4,When did you begin to feel you were just a shell of your former self?
22,8,1,"A 'slippery slope'? Tell me more about that feeling".
23,12,3,I guess it all started back in vaudeville.
17,0,1,Oh, I see... so what does this "stepping on" have to do with your morale?
15,1,0,Why do you think it makes you peel that way?
42,4,2,I recognize that others have fallen for you, but trust me, it's just transference.
18,1,1,So you feel that bad luck follows you? Let's explore...
16,1,0,A peeling is not appealing.
15,1,0,And what makes you think people don't take you seriously?
18,2,0,Tell me about why you feel abandoned.
23,5,2,Yes, you are THE slippery slope.
32,10,5,It's not a metaphor! She literally took my manhood and turned it into a smoothie!
16,1,0,Psych hold? Worried I'd make others slip?
18,4,0,I feel guilty about all the slip and falls that I've caused.
22,2,2,So today i wanted us to focus on your bananal fixation.
22,3,1,So, you think nobody finds you appealing?
18,3,1,You say you're insecure but I find you to be very appealing.
43,21,12,Tell me more about this dream with your father and the blender
17,2,0,Are you sure it was a Freudian slip?
23,6,1,This reminds me, I have to pick up my groceries.
17,2,0,I don't even sleep with green bananas.
37,14,8,Seeing as I ate you for lunch, I'll comp this session.
18,3,0,Let's discuss this perception that your appeal is slipping, and you feel empty inside.
27,4,4,Lucky for you I specialize in banana splits
17,2,0,Sometimes we all feel empty inside. But when you fall down... well, you know.
16,1,0,You seem devoid of substance lately.
16,0,0,You are appealing then you think.
30,7,5,You know in my day I was Top Banana.
22,6,1,I'm headed for a split.
20,2,0,I'm sorry to hear about your boyfriend, but bananas split all the time.
24,10,1,Perhaps you hurt others because you feel empty inside?
51,26,15,And just why do you think people tip-toe around you?
22,1,2,I don’t know, doc, I just feel all empty inside. It’s really affecting my sex life.
63,7,2,I think I need to see a doctor, I'm peeling
16,0,0,You think you're a banana peel - but it's in the nature of hallucinations to be untrue.
14,1,0,Do you feel like everyone is stepping on you often?
29,5,3,And you were still living as a male then?
20,2,1,So, you decided to peel away from the bunch and accept blame for the slips of others.
49,28,15,Do you feel you're a danger to yourself or others?
20,5,0,Let's explore why you enjoy making people slip.
16,2,1,I know, its been like three decades since the Knicks' last championship.
18,2,0,...again with the Freudian slips.
29,9,5,Let's talk about your feeling bruised and discarded.
24,8,2,When did start feeling like garbage?
16,1,0,Go on, Mr. Bobbitt.
25,3,3,Yes, you are a fruit. Deal with it.
15,1,0,Why don't you accept yourself more, than everyone will like you.
27,8,2,I've been stepped on my entire life.
20,5,1,Let's talk about your recurring sense of emptiness.
19,2,1,That's not a Freudian slip.
17,4,0,When did you first split up?
22,7,1,When I told you last week to work on being more appealing to others, I didn't think you'd take me literally.
48,6,2,How did you feel when you first realized she was a tarantula?
17,1,0,Remember, life throws curves at everyone.
32,5,1,So then he just split?
20,3,1,And that's when my life really hit the skids...
22,6,2,You say you feel empty, like your insides have been eaten out and you're all alone, tossed out on the street. Can you elaborate?
37,8,4,You are clearly not the victim here.
15,0,0,The 'bottom-opening hack' has upset a bunch. You're not alone.
18,1,0,I just can't hide my true self anymore" "You're completely right, Mr. Trump
30,14,3,So she slipped. Get over it!
38,23,5,When did you start feeling empty inside?
40,0,0,What was it like, being a member in a big hand?
24,6,2,But no one should ever compare you to an apple or to an orange.
17,1,0,And what do YOU mean by a Freudian Slip?
17,1,0,After years of anguish from witnessing his family being made into a fruit salad, Jeff the Banana seeks psychological help.
17,2,0,It's just that I want to be special. I want to be the cherry on top. Who's that cherry think he is anyway!
37,15,9,And how does it make you feel when you think people are avoiding you?
13,0,0,Umm..I should have given him an extra two or three minutes when he told me he was going bananas.
28,17,2,So your mother was rotten and your father split
16,3,0,No. You're not paranoid. Everyone IS blaming you for their slip-ups. How does that make you feel?
25,5,3,Okay, so you feel discarded and tired of being stepped on, but feel guilty for hurting people....is that right?
15,0,0,That Ludwig keeps taunting: "Ba-Na-Na-Na!"
28,7,4,Now tell me how that made you peel?
16,0,0,So tell me why it is you think you've, as you said earlier, "gone bananas?"
16,2,0,Don't you think your mother could have fallen because of a Freudian slip?
33,8,2,so, how often do you get the feeling that people are walking all over you?
17,2,0,So tell me... How did you get from being in the compost to being one of the biggest GMO tycoons in the nation?
19,0,1,When did you start slipping up?
32,2,1,I want to change my life, but I just can't see the appeal
26,12,2,So you suspect monkey business?
19,5,0,You mentioned a feeling of emptiness...do you have this feeling often?
20,7,0,So,how long have you felt like you were really a plantain on the inside?
21,4,0,So why do you feel so unappeeling?
22,7,1,It sounds like a classic Freudian slip.
16,3,0,This is the third slip this month.
17,2,0,I don't know why she left you. Maybe you just didn't a-peel to her?
16,1,0,Identity problem again?
17,1,0,You say you have peel envy?
28,16,2,When did you first notice you'd lost touch with your inner self?
17,2,0,You're Freudian slip reveals that like your father you find the idea of splitting down to an island republic appealing.
21,3,1,Then I was rejected as one of the bunch.
22,7,1,She got under your skin but we can work on it.
18,4,0,I believe that comment was a banana slip.
21,6,1,I think you can stop second-guessing your own premise. If you think they set you up to be the fall guy, then they probably did.
25,3,2,Let's talk about why you don't think you're a-peeling.
29,13,4,"How long did you hang around with a bad bunch?
17,2,1,And why do you feel guilty?
13,0,0,So let me get this straight... you say that people falling head over heels for you is a bad thing? f?
24,1,1,I know he slipped on you, but why exactly did you need to come here?
20,7,0,Do you think being called a fruit is an insult?
20,4,1,While I also find you appealing, we must keep this professional.
25,3,2,"That one slipped right by me".
31,7,2,I don't know doc, I think I'm just tired of being sexually objectified.
21,3,1,I need your undivided attention.
24,3,3,You're a banana peel. Of course people hate you. I hate you.
25,9,2,So you've lost touch with your inner self-tell me about that.
20,4,1,Explain to me why you feel people look at you as slippery and that you have no appeal.
39,10,10,Things have been really tough since the split.
20,2,1,It seems like a bad case of split personalities.
19,2,1,After I got over my envy and cowardice, I told them that black skin matters.
21,3,0,I believe you are suffering from ecdysiatimism. But don't worry, it got me through medical school.
32,18,4,I'm sorry. I was hungry.
27,2,1,Would you prefer I address you as Mr. Foster or "Bananas"?
18,0,1,What's you rarliest memory of wanting to make someone slip?
14,0,0,What makes you think I'm interested in phallic symbols?
28,12,1,Why do you have a fear of monkeys?
22,7,1,Stop obsessing about your black spots. You look great for two days old.
20,6,0,When did you start feeling as though people were always stepping on you?
25,6,3,You're unpeeling me with your eyes.
24,7,2,Looking at your inner self may be a lost cause.
20,7,0,And when did you first feel like you were going bananas?
30,12,4,Had you considered that perhaps they are laughing with you?
31,15,4,I feel like the whole world is falling down around me.
19,1,1,“You feel failure because you went on a bowl of cereal instead of fulfilling a dream of being Bananas Foster?
26,7,3,A hazard to anyone who encounters you? Don't you think that's a little theatrical?
22,7,1,Sometimes I just feel so empty inside.
30,8,4,How did that make you feel, when they just threw you away like that?
20,3,1,lets start back at this "pre-lunchbox" period then, as youve coined it.
17,0,0,I'm sorry, Hillary, but hiding behind the old 'I slipped on a slip on a banana peel' made you do it excuse won't work here.
27,19,2,It appears you opened up too much.
19,5,0,Well, I can understand why your ego might be bruised when you let a bunch of clowns walk all over you.
49,29,13,Now, just tell me what's eating you.
21,5,1,You have to stop being the scapegoat for everyone else's slip ups!
22,4,1,I appeal to you to return to the bunch.
22,6,3,I just haven't been peeling right
29,5,4,It’s just an ugly stereotype doc. I mean how would you feel “Look out it’s a banana peel”, or “Don’t get near the banana peel”, “Oh, here comes the big scary banana peel!"... Nice legs by the way.
22,5,0,But, is there really a "right" end to peel from?
21,6,1,"So I understand you come from a blended family"!!
18,4,0,So you blame a few aging spots on your skin for this sense of emptiness...
20,3,1,How long have you felt that people were laughing at you?
21,5,0,No, the Freudian slip didn't happen that way.
23,4,2,So what makes you think you aren't appealing?
22,1,2,But how did it FEEL when she stepped on you?
23,0,2,Vikram Yoga may be able to help you with life/work balance.
19,7,0,It's no accident that you're here.
17,1,0,So what you are saying is, your parents are trippin'.
18,0,1,Every time I go outside, everyone goes backwards.
33,11,5,'Now tell me, what happened after the chimp first spotted you'
21,4,1,I hear you saying you feel empty and wonder if you still have appeal?
18,3,0,Tell me why you think you lost your appeal.
44,10,1,"You're not responsible for other people's behavior. If they slip and fall, that's their shtick.
36,5,1,I just feel like I'm being split apart!
18,1,1,I find you strangely appealing...
18,2,0,Tell me more about how you were picked on and called the "fat fruit."
29,10,4,No, you could not have caused a Freudian slip!
19,4,0,Sometimes Freud is just Freud.
19,1,4,So, this "emptiness" started when the banana split?
18,3,0,And how long have you been having this recurring nightmare of the clumsy man in a porkpie hat?
19,3,0,I'm telling you, I've gone bananas!
19,2,1,But do you see yourself as appealing?
15,0,0,You've repressed your unconscious,Chiquita, to the brink of psychic annihilation.
25,5,3,Have you thought about getting some new material?
20,3,1,Why do you feel like everything is slipping away?
17,2,0,I'm glad you find me appealing too...
15,0,0,I guess Freud was right...
25,6,2,You have nightmares about being hung from a tree?
16,1,0,Oh, C'mon, this isn't about your mother.
15,0,0,Mommy always told me I had great appeal, but I'm not so sure.
17,1,0,For a banana peel, you're actually doing really well.
16,1,0,How does it feel when people leave you out?
17,3,0,hey doc i think my father had banana split personality disorder !!!
28,8,4,What did you do with the chimp?
19,5,0,Hmmm. You're venturing on to some very slippery terrain there.
16,0,0,How do you banana peel about that?
21,3,1,Even the "top banana" may eventually slip.
33,13,5,I don't think you will ever find your inner self.
46,14,14,Under these circumstances, my rate is on a sliding scale
18,3,0,So you're why so many Freudians slip...
33,8,5,What makes you think you are slipping?
20,2,1,How long have you been a Banana Republican?
23,1,3,I was spoiled rotten as a kid. Now I have no backbone.
40,31,9,You didn't see the split coming?
25,2,1,One way we can work through his is by accepting you have a slippery side.
20,2,1,You miss breeding fruit flies.
20,0,1,So, how do you feel about that slip?
24,3,3,Yes, you have no banana!
18,2,0,Some women think that I am quite appealing!
44,18,10,how long have you identified as a vegetable?
32,5,1,She's not the only one 'fleck'd with brown and a golden hue.'
31,5,3,Take a deep breath, and repeat to yourself "I'm more than a punchline, I'm more than a punchline".
25,7,2,So why do you think there is something missing in your sex life?
19,5,0,Sorry, but any further innuendo and we'll have to end the session.
21,5,1,It's natural to feel empty after a loss.
18,0,1,Don't focus on the "only"--beauty IS skin deep.
26,4,0,Are you mocking the way I sit?
18,4,0,Yes, the inner soul is rarely as beautiful as the outer.
26,2,0,I always feel like I've got one foot in the grave.
18,3,0,I feel like I have been on a slippery slope as of late
20,3,1,So you see yourself as a catalyst for change?
20,4,0,...and then my ex left me in the middle of the road.
24,11,1,No, I believe you. You don't need to show it to me.
48,4,4,Whoever told you that you were a worthless piece of trash; They were right. You are a worthless piece of trash.
21,6,3,And how did it feel when the monkey tossed you aside.
25,10,2,'Appeal' is all I have left
19,3,1,Do you think I have a split personality?
19,4,0,Give it to me straight doc, do you think I'm bananas?
19,2,1,And what does your wife say when you turn into a banana?
15,0,0,How did you feel about the peeling?
22,7,1,Let's talk about your split.
29,10,3,Well, I think this was a very fruitful session.
18,3,0,Quit looking so smug!
19,5,0,Tell me, why is your first instinct always to split?
25,4,1,Do you think you'd be less depressed if you could learn to enjoy physical comedy?
22,3,2,What makes you believe you have a split personality?
29,5,0,So whose always ridiculing your potassium deficiency?
631,858,738,Now that you've opened up, let's talk about what's eating you.
16,0,0,Do you want to talk about how you felt when Freud slipped on you?
24,6,2,Well yes...it is ironic that my slip is also showing...
16,1,0,Have you considered embracing, or even finding joy in, the slippery.
16,2,0,You can't peel away your problems.
23,4,2,Tell me, why do you feel so unfulfilled?
21,7,0,How are you peeling? I mean...feeling?
23,7,1,How does the split make you feel?
21,3,0,When did you first realize that you identified more with satire?
15,0,0,I agree "it's what is on the inside that counts" was passive-aggressive, but you can't let Tina get to you like that.
23,2,3,Let's not let anything slip through the cracks.
37,8,3,So...You slipped again?
58,7,3,Can you be more specific, Mr. B., in describing how your performance has suffered?
15,0,0,"And how do you peel about that?"-woman "Tear-able"-Banana
19,2,0,And if my legs are much hotter than yours?
42,32,10,I can see why she fell for you.
18,1,1,I can see that confidence is not your problem.
19,2,1,I don't know why I peel this way .
49,24,15,So you feel people are avoiding you?
20,3,0,So you and your wife are headed to Splitsville?
32,11,5,I believe you have a split personality.
16,2,0,Like Jeb you have nothing left that appeals to anyone.
15,1,0,And why exactly do you feel so broken?
19,1,1,How long have you had these feelings of emptiness inside you?
15,0,0,You say no one thinks you are appealing?
20,3,1,Transference is a slippery slope.
19,4,0,I'm not trying to hurt anyone; I just want to be noticed.
35,12,6,I can see why you feel discarded.
29,10,1,Why do you feel that he won't fall for you?
22,4,0,How long have you had the feeling of being just an old joke?
16,1,0,Last visit of course I'll join you in the Banana Boat Song.
52,44,13,Depressed because you're no longer one of the bunch?
27,11,3,Of course you have appeal.
24,1,3,And you're depressed because no one slipped on you?
27,10,6,Classic banana-split-personality disorder.
31,6,6,And just when did you feel this relationship start slipping away?
19,3,0,Have you considered approaching Cialis Mr. Dole?
15,1,0,so how do you feel being the cause of people's constant falls?
26,6,0,I just feel like I'm a big joke.
24,12,1,Don't be discouraged – not all women care about that.
23,8,1,Don't worry. It's not unusual to feel useless at your stage in life.
35,8,3,I'm here because I feel empty and discarded.
23,6,1,Yes, I would say it should be quite normal to feel a little empty inside
23,6,2,Yes, throwing yourself on the floor as someone walks by, is a form of co-dependence.
17,1,0,I'm feeling so empty inside. It's just bananas.
28,3,1,You slipped up ... Who? How? Why?
22,5,1,Tell me more about your feelings of aban(ana)donment!
18,0,1,And you feel your spouse is slippery?
19,5,0,How does that typically make you peel?
19,3,0,So when did you start feeling like a mere shell of your former self?
19,3,0,About how long ago did you and your wife split?
23,9,1,So, you have this recurring dream.! You think people are avoiding you.
20,1,1,It was a Freudian slip.
20,1,2,That is not what is meant by the term Freudian slip.
34,9,7,Well, I'm flattered, but I think we need to keep our relationship purely slapstick.
24,8,2,Really, your the victim?
92,80,52,Maybe you'd be more comfortable on the floor.
15,0,0,The issue is too much positive reinforcement for your hurtful actions against others.
20,3,1,I am not getting paid enough for this.....
36,6,0,So you offered Chiquita protection, and she threw it all away?
27,8,3,I'm thinking split personality.
19,5,0,You say you slipped up. But how exactly?
18,0,1,Okay, so we can begin with your mother abandoning you.
34,5,0,Don't have to take it so personally, your name just slipped my mind.
15,0,0,You have to REALLY want to change.
16,0,0,I'm no stranger to the transference game, Mr. Abernathy.
30,2,2,Why do you feel people look at you differently?
21,4,1,I guess you are just a Freudian slip.
17,3,0,It's very tough to understand, I know. I just feel very empty inside.
27,7,4,So when did you develop this fear of monkeys?
31,3,0,This would be a lot more productive if you said something other than 'K'.
20,1,2,Banana envy?
57,41,19,What would you like to be able to say to those monkeys?
22,6,1,It's normal. I'd say that most peels feel empty inside.
30,2,2,Next session we'll examine the Freudian slips!
36,2,3,Don't be a schlemiel, peel. Next time move out of the way!
20,1,1,I feel like my life is slipping away.
28,12,3,And in these dreams, you say he's falling?
24,5,2,I just feel that life is slipping by me
16,3,0,So tell me how the split has affected you..
22,5,2,I just don't know how to cope with all my peelings anymore.
44,17,14,I have this reoccurring dream where I slip on a human being.
13,3,0,We need to peel back the layers to find the underlying problem.
22,3,1,So my Freudened Jung lady, do I not have a peel?
15,0,0,Ever since she left, it's like my life has been rotting away.
20,1,0,I'm going to level with you, this seems like the product of a very slippery mind.
24,2,0,Turnover a new leaf. Wake up and smell the roses.
25,6,3,So, how are you coping with the split?
22,12,0,You must feel very empty inside.
27,12,3,It's obvious to me that you can no longer afford to ignore the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room!
20,3,2,OK. Start with Cruz,
23,8,1,All right, no more 'slippery slope' references. My bad.
28,10,3,I think you might have a future in comedy.
19,3,1,So you're feeling somewhere above dog poo but still below a puddle?
34,1,0,I understand that this situation isn't very appealing, but you need to take your mental health seriously.
23,9,1,Now that we've peeled off the layers, let's see what we're left with.
20,4,1,It's not love, it's Doctor-peel transference
26,14,2,It's not only what's inside that matters.
16,0,0,She pierced my veil of aromatic happiness and found I was all rotten inside.
16,0,0,Do you need a more comfortable bed? You are falling apart in pieces.
15,0,0,But you agreed to peal?
23,4,1,"I think we're getting to the core now"!
19,2,1,Let's talk about why you feel like a joke and why you seem to feel "stepped on."
24,3,3,Tell me more about this feeling that your life is just a series of jokes.
16,1,0,Do you believe Mario intentionally ran you over?
24,5,1,I'm just tired of being the fall guy all the time.
34,21,6,In dreams, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
81,77,39,What I think isn't important. Do you think you're an accident waiting to happen?
28,5,4,Let's peel that back
35,17,6,Separation anxiety is a perfectly normal reaction.
36,7,2,So where do you think this need to separate and split from the bunch comes from?
20,4,1,They're not completely without fault. After all, yellow does signal caution.
37,17,7,Why do you prefer to identify as a plantain?
25,9,2,What constitutes "appeal" can be very slippery, as you know.
16,1,0,So, how do you feel when people say you're not really a fish?
21,4,1,Okay, so no one's ever slipped on you, get over it!
42,8,5,And for how long have you had this sense that you've lost your comic timing?
50,28,16,Maybe not everyone wants to be swept off their feet
25,13,2,So you think you have a split personality?
17,1,0,The bigger picture is the laughter and joy for the children, not the physical discomfort to the individual.
22,2,1,No, I mean you are a pealing - literally.
20,3,1,Quit blaming yourself. You are not the cause of a Freudian slip.
20,4,0,They used to rave about my potassium and fiber, and now it's just slurs about my glycemic index.
35,11,7,You can't live your life just waiting for others to slip up.
33,12,6,You shouldn't feel guilty every time someone falls. Just the funny times.
19,3,0,When did you first noticed you were being stalked by monkeys?
18,2,0,Actually, you look very ap"peel"ing!
19,0,2,I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life !
20,3,1,I believe you are suffering from banana envy.
32,6,2,Maybe slap-stick comedy just isn't you're calling!
22,4,3,This may sound unprofessional, but I find you appealing
21,7,1,No, I will not fall for you--that would be completely inappropriate.
18,3,0,I am going bananas.." ohh, you've slipped again?.
18,0,1,It's normal to feel some guilt when you believe you've caused a person to slip and have an accident.
40,6,1,"You have an unhealthy obsession with the concept of a 'split personality'".
37,11,9,Why do YOU think everyone laughs when you get stepped on?
28,11,3,You have to stop letting people walk all over you, Nana.
28,5,3,Our split was the best thing for us.
32,16,4,I know it's not easy but you're comparing apples and oranges.
15,0,0,I think I could use a glass of water.
16,1,0,I don't know what to do doc, I have this feeling that I'm all appeal and no substance.
20,4,1,So you're saying due to the popularity if plantains, you ego is now bruised?
16,0,0,I'm afraid I'm going to need to terminate our therapeutic relationship; you're simply too a-peeling for me to maintain professional boundaries.
22,5,1,What do mean when you say you sometimes go bananas?
24,6,1,I just feel like I'm missing something.
32,6,1,Lets peel off the ripe years and slip into childhood
19,1,1,So you feel guilty about all these slip-ups?
27,1,0,Sometimes a banana is just a banana peel.
18,2,0,I prefer the term "erectile dysfunction".
19,1,1,Could you connect these feelings of emptiness with the impulse to make people slip?
15,0,0,Let's see if I understand: your father says to relax and he'll make sure no one slips on you, your mother says you already are a twirly skirt, and your brother won't talk to you like you are now.
16,0,0,My killer instinct just keeps growing.
68,33,27,Calm down. Try to compost yourself.
25,6,3,I get it, you're not the top banana anymore.
21,3,1,I was told to come and see you about making a Freudian slip
19,2,1,So, what do you think about this...
16,1,0,I know it's what is on the inside that's important, but that doesn't make it hurt any less.
24,4,2,You're right, you are unappealing.
15,0,0,Why can't you just stop being a contract killer you're tired of wiping out people who slip up on you?
29,15,2,Why do you keep dating monkeys if you feel they always take more than they give?
21,7,1,My life's become a joke, Doc.
20,2,1,I just feel like no matter what I do I'm always letting things slip
29,14,3,It's like he only cared about what was on the inside...
15,1,0,Are you trying to provoke me into a Freudian slip?
19,3,0,Get over it. Your life is one big joke.
15,0,0,I don't find behavioral therapy to be very appealing.
21,4,1,So you're feeling a void?
29,9,4,My specialties are orange rinds and cherry pits, but I've had success with clients similar to you.
29,11,3,How long has it been since your partner split?
24,14,0,It's good to see that you are finally opening up.
15,0,0,Are you telling me about a blonde joke?
16,1,0,Mr. Peal, I'm afraid you are an empty husk.
18,4,0,You do realize that Freud hated bananas.
30,10,4,At this point, you're just arguing apples and oranges.
29,10,4,Peelings, nothing more than peelings....
28,7,1,Well I suppose I first started acting out when my father split
25,6,2,This makes you feel rotten, because?
21,1,2,Look, I'm sorry, but I just don't find you appealing.
19,5,0,I just feel like something's missing.
22,3,2,You don't think it could've just been a Freudian slip?
16,1,0," I have a very slippery personality".
17,2,0,''Lily, tell me why you feel your world has turned upside down.''
19,2,1,When it comes to answering my questions, you are a slippery one!
29,7,4,I feel people are trying to avoid me.
23,7,1,We're on a slippery slope here.
21,5,2,Perhaps you feel that way because you actually are empty on the inside. ['are' should be underlined]
17,0,1,Don't be so upset, "going bananas" doesn't refer to you
28,10,3,You're saying you made a Freudian slip...literally?
17,3,0,Mr. Dole, I can help you peel away each of your concerns. Let's begin with your lack of taste.
24,8,1,How long has it been since he split?
20,0,1,So you broke away from the bunch you grew up with, and since then...you just haven't been peeling yourself?
17,2,0,This guilt...is it that you blame yourself for their slip? Or because you also laugh at them?
17,0,0,George must have finished his banana early. He needs a new one.
18,4,0,So, you're saying you're related to the Austrian Peels that gave Freud the slip?
23,5,2,And in this dream, what is in your pocket?
20,3,1,Peel back the layers & tell me when it all started.
20,3,2,Try thinking of all the mirth you bring to others.
29,9,4,I'm tired of being blamed for everybody's slip ups!
60,27,19,First you were eaten alive, and then spent years in slapstick? Of course you feel rotten.
16,1,0,I don't find your thoughts about me at all appealing!
21,6,1,I prefer not to be called Chiquita.
30,9,5,We need to peel back a bit more.
23,5,1,This separation is making me feel like garbage.
19,5,0,An prescription of ice cream, sprinkles and a spoon are usually successful in cases such as yours.
22,7,1,Why do you hurt the people who are closest to you?
38,8,1,Sorry, I'm not into erotic countertransference.
18,4,0,You seem split.
25,10,2,When do you feel your life became a joke?
21,9,0,Now that you've finally opened up, I can see that you're truly empty inside.
22,8,0,I think we have achieved a breakthrough. You finally realize your life has not been fruitless.
19,3,0,My life has been characterized by a long slippery slope.
36,25,6,He slipped, he fell. You've got to stop blaming yourself.
19,2,1,What do -you- think you're a symbol of?
24,2,3,Slipped up again, did we?
19,5,0,I just can't shake this feeling that I already have one foot in the grave.
27,14,3,Yes, they're laughing, but let's explore why you think it's at you.
22,5,1,Peeling better?
20,1,1,Well, my mother started hanging with a pretty ripe bunch, that's when my Dad split.
19,1,0,Quit looking at my legs--I'm not a slippery person.
19,2,1,You need to free yourself of the guilt, he did not slip because of you
18,1,0,I am sorry Mr. Banana, but you are too soft. I like my fruit firm. Now lets continue our session.
17,1,0,I'm sorry Mr. Cavendish, but would you be more comfortable with a less a-peeling therapist?...
18,3,0,You can't let the down fall of some many be totally your responsibility.
18,0,1,I'm sorry, but could you please explain what a "hollaback girl" is again?
15,1,0,You don't seem happy to be seeing me.
19,1,1,You want to put your what into my what?!? You really are sick.
22,5,1,You mustn't let 'low comedy' define you.
19,3,1,I'm diagnosing you a slipzophrenic.
36,2,0,Now that we switched places, do you have anything to say?
18,4,0,What's your greatest fear at the zoo?
18,2,0," SO, at what point did you go Bananas?
23,10,1,Tell me about the split.
16,1,0,You feel '"blamed."
58,40,20,I agree. You're an accident waiting to happen.
34,7,5,What is this obsession with monkeys?
33,6,0,If you're looking for a Freudian Slip here you can forget it...
27,5,4,You made who slip?
15,1,2,Please stay off my floor--no need to make a Freudian slip.
21,5,1,Your time is up.
17,5,0,We need to move beyond these Freudian slips.
16,1,0,You're slick, but I don't relish a seated slide
17,0,0,You know, I didn't say it has to be a Freudian slip...
30,5,1,Let's start by peeling back the layers of your childhood.
22,6,1,How long have you felt that people avoid you?
19,0,2,You called it off just because he called you a bahnana instead of a banana?
16,2,0,What makes you think people are stepping all over you?
17,4,0,I've just been feeling so empty lately...
24,3,2,The bystanders who laughed may be feeling guilt too.
19,5,0,Sounds like you have a split personality.
20,1,1,That was a Freudian split.
26,7,3,It's natural to feel you've lost the best part of yourself in a split.
36,6,8,So you split on a sundae, right?
21,4,1,So, you're feeling a bit split lately? I think I can dole you out a prescription.
16,1,0,That's not very appealing
15,0,0,Yes it's painful now, but I promise one day we'll all just laugh.
18,0,0,It looks like you are happy to see me.
17,2,0,How long have you felt disregarded?
23,4,2,I feel empty since our split.
19,1,0,Interesting test case for Darwinian principles, one way or another.
18,1,1,When did you begin to feel life had passed you by?
46,24,15,How often do you have the Carmen Miranda dream?
19,3,1,You don't look delusional to me, really.
16,1,0,I can see that this experience has eviscerated you. But at the same time, you've gained balance.
31,4,0,I thought your appointment was on Wednesday.
19,2,1,And why don't you think people take you seriously?
15,0,0,Tell me more about how your father caused your mother such embarrassment.
21,9,0,I think that we are on a slippery subject here.
22,8,1,Diagnosis: split personality disorder.
15,0,0,I appreciate your commitment to continuing therapy, Mr. Ferguson... But why a banana peel?
21,5,1,It's only normal to be experiencing separation anxiety.
13,0,0,What you're dealing with is survivor guilt... but trust me, Luigi will race again, even without Mario.
17,2,0,I know we've talked about the neatness, and we've talked about the oral fixation, but there's still something missing...
18,3,0,Going bananas? I'm sorry, I only see fruitcakes.
22,7,1,Whenever I slip up, everyone laughs.
22,2,1,I understand you feel like you are a peeling.
17,4,0,I feel empty.
15,0,0,I feel like you never answer my question directly . . .
31,24,6,Doc, I just feel like I'm an accident waiting to happen.
35,2,0,A slip is usually the result - not cause - of an unconscious mind.
15,1,0,It’s not important that I’m appealing.
25,4,3,A thick skin can be a slippery slope.
27,4,2,I don't do "Freudian."
20,2,1,Seems to me like that was a Freudian split.
18,4,0,I understand you identify as a vegetable. Only progressive grocery stores will you keep separate from the other fruits.
19,3,0,I knew you found me a-peeling
40,17,7,It's a clear cut case of banana split personality.
22,5,1,The technical term for it is Dissociative Identity Disorder.
17,1,0,When did you first notice you were slipping back?
16,1,0,You feel empty inside and think that is slippery ground to be on?
28,4,2,I was doing so well and then I slipped.
34,8,6,Tell me about the urge to call a woman "chiquita".
26,4,1,Where are you going to come up with a hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour?
26,12,2,So you think you finally got that monkey off your back?
27,4,2,And how does being the brunt of so many jokes make you feel?
20,1,1,Now we need closure.
12,0,0,It must have been a terrible blow to your self-image as "the yellow stalker" when friends called it corny.
15,0,0,Would you say you're feeling hollow on the inside?
43,7,0,So, I hear your life has been pretty slippery these days.
24,6,2,Wow, that must have been traumatic for you. But how did that make you Peel?
31,13,4,Sometimes I feel like you're not all here.
31,5,5,Your case is appealing to me.
22,4,2,I don't know, how does a housewife eat a banana?
75,37,33,You think you're crazy? I'm talking to a banana.
17,1,0,It's always difficult when a banana splits after a long marriage.
14,0,0,So could it be that your lack of sex appeal as a sexless peel keeps slipping you up in relationships once someone falls for you?
19,1,1,Origination of the Freudian Slip
16,1,0,So, my wife said she was leaving me because of my obsession with monkeys.
17,2,0,The fact is, you're slippery. They were laughing with you, not at you.
19,5,0,Classic case of a 'split' personality.
29,3,3,It's like I have nothing more to contribute. I feel used, empty inside.
28,9,2,So approximately how long have you felt this emptiness?
24,8,2,Well, you are slippery.
19,2,1,Why do you feel you're always the fall guy?
31,1,1,Describe your feelings when they accused you of acting like a star.
33,19,5,So, you're tired of being stepped on?
19,7,1,They keep falling for you.... How does that make you feel?
25,5,3,Life is driving me bananas.
17,2,0,Do you realize how much of your inner being you have lost?
16,1,0,i have the feeling that my attraction for feet is slipping away
18,3,0,Yet you still feel devoid of appeal?
26,6,3,Still, a part of you will always be in her fruit salad.
22,4,2,I love the effort, but in our last session I said we were going to explore how you FEEL.
20,4,1,No, Mr. Peel, I do not want to slip on something more comfortable.
15,4,0,So, why'd you split?
22,4,2,So tell me more about this sense of emptiness you have been feeling.
25,13,1,I just feel empty.
19,2,1,I know she ate your insides out and then dropped you. Try to think about the future. You'll make some compost pile very happy.
29,1,0,No, it's totally natural for you to be aroused a drawing of a member of the opposite sex. That's normal, not only for banana peels, but also for grown men who have steady jobs and even, perhaps, a moderately popular Tumblr blog. Totally normal.
26,8,3,So you think that you're responsible for the Freudian slip?
37,24,6,I'm glad you finally opened up.
17,1,0,You seem to have a lack of potassium. Could this be affecting your erectile dysfunction?
20,7,0,You say you feel empty inside. Why do you think that is?
19,1,1,You *have* to get over these feelings of inferiority.
21,4,1,I'd like to refer you to a Skinnerian.
47,25,14,It's my professional opinion that you are an accident waiting to happen.
21,1,0,Let me get this right - when the bunch you hung out with turned too bad you peeled off and got yourself a new skin ?
16,3,0,Lately, I feel empty inside.
21,9,0,And instead of taking me to the compost, this putz had the nerve to dump me in the trash, like I'm garbage or something.
37,17,7,How many monkeys did you say there were?
38,10,5,I didn't say you were JUST a banana.
34,0,1,I can help you out . Which way did you come in?
15,1,0,And this feeling all began when you were banned from Bountiful ?
27,8,3,I know you don't like to talk about your ex, but we need to discuss the split
21,9,0,Tell me more about these feelings of emptiness.
26,6,3,You'll just have to face it. You are spineless
26,12,2,You're bipeeler.
19,1,1,You have fears of falling?
33,1,0,He's a slippery one
12,2,2,Why do you refuse to be labeled?
28,5,5,If you were a fruit, which one would you be?
26,6,3,I'm sick and tired of being second
24,6,2,I'm sure strawberries have it just as bad.
18,1,0,May I assume there are no more letters for today, Mr. Kong?
15,0,0,And why do you think you have trouble seeing my beard and cigar?
20,2,1,I think you may have experienced a sizable loss during the phallic stage...
42,20,10,Well it could just mean you've moved past the phallic stage.
21,3,0,She said I'm bananas and have no appeal.
24,4,0,So, when did you start to think people were laughing at you?
15,1,0,Just because they're laughing - doesn't make it a Freudian slip.
19,1,1,Yes now that you have opened up I understand the appeal that separates you from the bunch, but I can't slip from my professional oath.
19,1,1,Do you think everyone finds you appealing?
22,3,1,Nobody takes me seriously.
22,7,1,OK, can I now speak to Mr. Apple?
15,1,0,I see you have slipped into something more comfortable.
31,9,3,Just how often do you hear, "Day-O" ringing in your ears?
19,5,0,You're ripe for a Freudian slip.
14,0,0,It's quite normal to want to pollinate the therapist.
22,1,0,So you’re getting a job at the slippery slope.
39,13,8,You're a Freudian slip waiting to happen.
21,5,1,Admitting that the slip was Freudian has been a major breakthrough.
18,3,0,I know you're upset but it's not your fault he slipped.
15,1,0,Did you consider that someone else might get hurt when you threw yourself down on the sidewalk?
17,2,0,So what I'm hearing you say is that you feel empty, small and unappealing?
25,6,2,People keep avoiding me.
33,16,6,You seem to be searching for your inner self.
15,0,0,For once, I'd like some to be glad to say "banana."
20,2,1,Stop blaming yourself. You didn't mean for that man to slip.
18,4,0,"Why do feel the need to get back to the wild bunch?
19,4,0,I can't begin to help you if you won't talk.
40,14,11,How does it make you feel when others call you an accident waiting to happen?
32,12,5,I keep having this reoccurring dream that I am trying to hurt someone.
22,2,1,It's either my overbearing mother or this weekly caption contest thing.
17,0,0,You're a banana afraid of a tarantula? Where is it?!!
21,3,2,No I would NOT like to slip into something more comfortable.
27,5,1,So it was only after the split that you began feeling empty inside and noticed your work was slipping?
18,3,0,"I felt used, discarded! ", Doc (sob) (sob)
23,2,2,My inner self slipped away
17,2,0,Now that you've peeled off your soft and mushy side, let's see if we can work on your dark spots
22,3,2,I really can't win for losing; I'm either over or under ripe!
35,6,5,No, you're definitely not a nutcase.
20,5,0,You feel empty,the monkey left you,your inner core was taken away!
18,3,0,No, no. I don't think you're nuts at all...
24,5,2,Yes, anyone can blame you, but why do you accept that blame?
16,1,0,Let's peel back another layer to uncover your roots.
19,0,0,Just how long has the lawyer's life cast a shadow on your conscience ?
21,1,0,You're heading down a slippery slope. Don't trip on yourself.
36,4,1,Not even your mother found you appealing?
21,1,1,The outer beauty is what really matters.
17,3,0,You,ve been outsourced. I can't make you great again.
19,1,1,No need for guilt. ..After all, what were the odds???
27,8,3,Don't you ever get tired of people stepping on you?
16,1,0,I can't explain it, Doctor. Nothing appeals to me, and I just feel so empty inside.
23,3,2,My previous client wanted to apologize for the fruit bowl mix-up.
18,0,1,Can you tell me your story again? This time with no slip-ups
19,4,0,You have stem envy.
50,28,15,Depression, heart palpitations, fatigue. You could be low in potassium.
19,4,0,Sounds like it was more than a Fruedian slip.
22,3,2,And when did you develop this irrational fear of apes?
15,1,0,So you don't think you have appeal?
19,3,0,I can't help it, I am naturally attracted to people with one foot in the grave.
23,4,2,Let's peel back the layers on how your parents slipped up.
16,0,0,I think you really do feel guilty of the fall that happened.
19,1,1,I hate it when they use the bathroom and snack during sessions!
15,0,0,People fall for you because it's your appeal? No,t hat is not a Freudian slip!
29,11,3,When he slipped and fell, how did that make you feel?
32,3,0,It's NOT your fault, it was a Freudian slip.
27,8,3,And just why do you not feel part of the bunch anymore?
26,3,0,So you're saying, despite its appeal, infidelity is a slippery slope. . .
15,1,0,Why do you feel the need to trip people?
19,2,1,You're not going to slip it to me again.
15,0,0,Dear, I'm afraid our son is into extreme sports.
21,9,0,Doc, I'm just sick of always getting stepped on.
17,1,0,Most don't want people walking all over them.
22,4,0,Tell me, how do you feel being used as a comedic device?...
27,4,0,Do you need a tissue?
19,3,0,Yes, Mr. B., a Freudian slip.
25,5,2,So the banana split but you still have appeal.
20,1,2,So how did you feel when she said she was no longer happy to see you?
18,2,1,I'm tired of being on the road all the time.
22,6,1,Of course you feel like one more slip and it's all over.
20,4,1,You feel the hilarity of someone slipping on you doesn’t compensate you for the pain of being stepped on? I’m sorry – I treat standup comedians on Thursdays only.
20,6,2,Were you teased for growing upside down?
22,6,1,It sounds like you are realizing that drugs, sex and money will not fill the void.
31,4,2,We both knew this day would come. How do you feel about the next stage of your life and career?
17,2,0,You have a certain "a peel", you just need to wait for the right person to come along and fall for you.
22,5,1,You know sometimes a banana is only a banana.
36,11,7,All of my training points to 'Edible Complex.'
19,1,1,In our last session; you spoke of safety concerns with your job at the ice cream...
45,25,4,Yours is the worst case of separation anxiety I've ever seen.
26,7,3,Sorry I laughed. Go on...
19,2,1,That was quite a Freudian slip.
19,5,0,So, you've been feeling funny.
16,1,0,My personality was never aPEELing to a bunch!
18,2,0,Well, it all started when he slipped on me...
19,1,1,I used to be the top banana, but now I feel it all slipping away.
24,6,2,I understand that you feel fruitless, but you haven't lost your appeal.
16,1,0,Would you say that you're still suffering feelings of abandonment?
38,8,3,Let's go back to the time you made that Freudian slip...
33,9,6,I've spent all my life being stepped on.
13,0,0,we've got to stop seeing each other like this.
18,4,0,So she gave you the slip?
18,1,1,And how long do you feel better after making the clown slip?
20,4,1,How long have you had this empty feeling?
17,4,0,I'll take you seriously when you start taking yourself seriously.
18,4,0,The "slippery slope" defence will not excuse your actions.
21,6,1,When was the first time you felt "hollow inside?"
20,1,1,Sorry. Mellow Yellow has been debunked.
18,3,0,How long have you felt unappealing?
17,4,0,So what exactly is it about exhibitionism that you find so appealing?
16,1,0,We share 50% of your genetic material, it only makes sense that we also share 50% of your problems.
36,2,0,So, you feel guilty about causing people to slip.Pee
21,4,1,What do you mean when you say you feel "empty inside"?
26,5,4,First, are you a starfish or a banana peel, as that may affect my diagnosis.
22,5,1,I am so frustrated! They blame ME for all of the slip-ups at work!!
23,7,2,...and how long have you felt this sense of emptiness, this loss of purpose?
19,5,0,So, tell me about these slip ups that you've made.
45,5,2,I don't find your story appealing.
21,5,2,Let's peel back the emotional skin on your relationship with your Nana.
28,7,4,I just feel so used and discarded.
18,3,0,So, which candidate do you imagine you'll land on?
18,1,1,Yes, you have no banana, no banana today. Yet, you must have hope and stop whining, for tomorrow morning you are going to the Big Bin to mingle and become one with other rotting Plant Life, to be reborn as Compost and bring sustenance to The Crops.
18,1,1,I think you should split custardy every sundae.
15,0,0,Ugh! He is forgetting to take his peels again.
42,5,0,So you've been feeling slippery lately. When did this begin?
24,12,0,So tell me, why do you feel so empty inside?

21,5,1,And you say you’re tired of being walked on?
16,0,0," I'm glad you lost the core. This is the new post Freudian counseling.
20,1,0,If you think that I will fall for this trick, you are nuts.
26,3,0,No I don't think you're too skinny.
17,4,0,Would you like to talk about your feeling of emptiness?
16,0,0,Who told you your feathers aren't fine?
20,3,1,Not everyone can been the top banana.
16,1,0,So you have this recurring nightmare that you're human?
18,1,0,Not every decision is a slippery slope.
19,2,1,I just feel like my split personality makes me less appealing
15,0,0,Cognitive slippage..couch slippage...whatever? I have a nail appointment.
17,5,1,I empathize with your feelings about the jokes of slipping on you and having "appeal", but isn't true that you ARE yellow?
15,1,0,You know, these feelings of neglect are quite normal at your age.
16,1,0,Oh, he must have slipped out.
19,2,1,That sounds more like a Freudian slip to me.
29,7,4,Is being a comedy staple so terrible ?
12,0,0,I understand you were used to being the "big banana" but your aren't organic.
25,9,2,I would say you're ripe for analysis.
26,9,3,Start from when you left the plantation.
19,1,1,So let me get this straight, YOU'RE the victim of all those slip and falls?
20,3,0,This really won't cure your phallicism."
19,2,1,Let me get this straight. You are stressed over a slip and fall because you think it is your fault?
25,6,3,And when someone slipped on you, how did that make you feel?
18,2,0,So, can you tell me more about this split?
18,2,0,You gave Freud the slip, when exactly?
34,7,4,You dreamt you slipped on a high heel...?
26,1,0,Would you describe your emotional state as peeled right now?
21,9,0,So you're saying that it wasn't your decision to split?
28,5,3,So your not peeling very well.
20,3,0,I know you asked me to not look at you but your emptiness was just too demanding!
19,2,1,So, your wife complains that you've lost your appeal?
32,6,4,I feel I'm appealing, but some see me as a big joke
19,0,1,So when he left, you thought he meant banana split?
25,5,4,Guilt? Why? After all, he stepped on you.
26,14,1,So you say that you feel empty inside...
16,1,0,"You feel people don't find you appealing?
16,0,0,So tel me how you feel, Mr. Banana Peel... How did you feel about being thrown out?
20,2,1,Tell me, Charles, how does that make you peel?
17,2,0,I understand that you don't peel very well
16,1,0,I'm sure those feelings are temporary - in fact, I'm going to ask you to pay cash.
40,13,11,You shouldn't dwell on being unfulfilled. It's fruitless.
30,3,4,No more Freudian slip jokes, OK?
31,18,4,I can understand why you feel empty inside.
15,0,0,I believe in Love too but not that kind.
33,4,2,so you think that you have lost your appeal..?
28,5,4,I guess I just don't understand why I always have to be the fall guy.
20,7,0,I don't know - somehow I feel as if things are just slipping away.
24,4,2,Banana split personality IS a real diagnosis.
31,11,2,Forget guilt about them falling. Why do you keep getting stepped on?
26,7,2,On a positive note, I can safely say you are not nuts.
32,20,0,So when you say you feel empty inside...
30,15,1,Carmen Miranda! Carmen Miranda! Get over her!
27,6,4,Do you feel that going out with such an ape has left you empty?
13,0,0,Have you nothing left to cover?
19,3,0,When did you first feel this desire to take people down
26,12,1,Your symptoms indicate a split personality...
22,5,2,I don't want to slip up with my wife but I can't help but feel she finds me unapeeling.
20,3,1,So...you say you have a history of making people fall down but you're upset when people think that's funny.
47,15,15,So, Mr. Fofanna, what brings you in today?
17,2,1,Tell me more about your fear of being typecast.
19,2,1,We should have known that you taking a job at an ice cream parlour would lead to separation anxiety.
19,1,0,But let's get to the root of this
28,6,4,Can you tell me why you split up?
27,11,3,We no longer use the term "gone bananas" anymore
24,6,2,I feel so empty inside.
20,2,0,So this empty feeling began how soon after he moved out?
19,5,0,I can slip you in for your next appointment in a week.
23,5,1,I don't care if you're just the peel. Stop looking up my skirt!
13,0,0,So let me understand... You're feeling guilt about surviving the New York City marathon after saw so many of your comrades were stepped on. Tell me more about that.
32,8,5,So she'll never dance again ... how do you feel about that?
18,4,0,Divorce? More like they got...split.
18,4,0,They call me heartless—but sometimes I just want a good trip, you know?
30,9,4,Even my wife calls me a slippery piece of garbage.
21,3,2,Who and what am I?
16,1,0,Yes, your banana has left you. Yes, you will get spots and rot. Yes, you may cause a senior citizen to slip and break their hip. But eventually, you're going to the Big Landfill where you will be rejoined with a Bunch. Have hope. You are not alone.
20,2,1,Let me see whether I understand you. You think that peeling back your emotions will produce a slippery slope?
17,4,0,Last week you're Marshian green and this week you're Asian yellow. I'm diagnosing you with a split personality.
20,3,1,You may want to check your potassium. I think you are over medicated.
41,14,10,So you admit you do get pleasure from causing people pain?!
18,2,0,So, you feel like an empty shell at times?
16,2,0,They're not laughing at you, they're laughing with you.
18,5,0,Tell me again about your mango envy
20,7,0,Clearly that ice cream parlor incident led to your split personality
26,14,2,I'm not sure I really understand what's eating at you.
20,4,1,What makes you say that you aren't getting any traction in your relationships?
23,7,1,Exactly when did you feel your relationship start to slip?
20,7,1,The separation anxiety is easier to treat than the hollow feeling.
15,2,0,I feel like I'm just a shell of my former self, Doc.
27,5,4,I, too, fear the vegans.
15,0,0,The encounter you say tore your guts out, yet you believe you have enough stuff left inside to plan some impish underfooted revenge?
17,4,0,My friends only noticed his large hairy body, his stooped posture and his incessant grunts, but he consumed me.
46,28,13,So, what's been eating you?
14,1,0,You need to accept some responsibility for how others react to you.
15,0,0,"How do you feel about growing up in garden in the United States and not a garden in South America"??
20,3,1,Would you feel better as a couch potatoes?
23,4,1,You want Freud to slip. How about this, " Sometimes a banana is just a banana".
27,10,3,No, it's perfectly natural to feel there's something missing in your life.
23,1,3,I just can't shake this schadenfreude...
19,1,1,Identity dysphoria can make you think you're not a peeling.
28,10,1,You're not responsible for someone else's slip
20,2,1,Tell me more about your mother.
28,6,1,I think all of my troubles started after my parents split
25,6,3,I see you're peeling better
20,1,1,Is there rigid banana flesh under your peel, or are you just happy to see me?
16,3,0,Tell me again about your day at the zoo, especially the part about the monkey house.
26,5,3,I think your having a small penis is the least of your worries Mr. Johnson.
15,0,0,No, you're not that "slick." Now let's get back to our session.
18,4,0,That ‘empty feeling’ often indicates a potassium deficiency.
23,5,2,Let me get this straight; you caused the Freudian slip?
21,1,2,Looking back, I should never have agreed to the split.
22,10,0,It's time for you to stop victim-blaming and admit that you're part of the problem.
41,7,0,I just can't shake the feeling that my life has been nothing but a slippery slope.
32,7,2,No Caitlyn, once it's gone, it's gone!
30,7,3,And how are you feeling since the banana split?
25,12,3,I've been this way since the split.
14,0,0,You say someone stepped on you and slipped?
32,13,5,So when did you split?
22,0,0,I can give you the name of a good spa.
19,5,0,Tell me more about feeling discarded Mr. Peel.
28,12,3,Sometimes it's not what's inside that counts.
28,10,4,Tell me about your loss of inner self.
20,1,1,So you only feel like half an octopus.
22,1,3,Why yes, I am Freudian trained. Why do you ask?
17,2,0,Why do you feel the need to laugh when people step on you?
15,1,0,Abandonment issues are no excuse to look up women's skirts.
21,8,3,Am I hearing you say that your life no longer bears fruit?
27,7,1,Mhm ... and how does that make you peel?
18,4,0,Why do you feel you are ripe for a change?
30,5,1,Beauty is only skin deep.
41,9,3,So, you're feeling incomplete ...
20,3,1,It's time you made clear boundaries, ones that keep you very far away from feet.
20,1,1,You say you're losing appeal?
17,2,0,I've always felt like a cabaret accoutrement.
17,2,0,I've really slipped up in life.
22,1,1,Hey, where did your other half go?
20,2,0,YOU DREMPT YOU SAW GONZILLA, THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
27,13,4,Maybe slapstick isn't for you. Have you thought about standup?
26,6,2,It doesn't matter what I think. Do YOU think your life has been one big joke?
18,5,0,Every time I get my life together, I cause someone else to slip.
17,2,0,We know what happens when you split up...
16,2,0,I'm sorry but our time is ripe.
16,1,0,Let's see, at our last session we were discussing you're a peel to others. Shall we start there?
46,3,1,When did you first realize she was running around on you?
17,3,0,What makes you think you're unappealing?
20,6,1,What's eating you this time?
23,0,1,Reality's you're integumentary, perceiving part the ripening process
17,0,1,And why do you want them to stop falling for your appeal?
28,5,0,So . . . you're feeling a little empty inside?
16,1,0,well what do you mean by a peeling ?
26,7,3,Sometimes it feels like my life is just an endless series of slip-ups
24,7,3,I just seem to let people walk all over me.
19,1,1,Just because you have pointy heads, yellowed skin and are bent over doesn't mean you're not lovable."
25,6,3,What's the difference that you ended up in a banana cream pie rather than a banana split? They're both to die for.
18,2,1,Are you saying that you've lost a peel?
22,2,2,I've overcome the abandonment issues and my addiction to slapstick comedy but the personal injury lawsuits are killing me
32,4,6,Is is possible not everyone shares your sense of humor?
34,12,7,We ARE making progress, but remember, sometimes a banana really is just a banana.
17,2,0,I didn't realize how traumatized banana peel would be without banana
30,10,4,So tell me more about this empty feeling you have.
18,3,0,Kiss me and I'll turn into a handsome Prince
19,5,0,What do you think caused you to slip?
26,3,0,What makes you think you're no loner appealing?
18,3,0,I feel there's something left hanging.
20,5,1,I'm sorry I can't submit to your foot fetish.
19,2,1,I can't get past losing my appeal!
19,3,1,This last split has been really hard on me.
22,5,2,I thought you were a couch potato.
17,1,0,What makes you think you lost your soul?
18,3,0,You should know by now life is a slippery slope.
18,3,1,You feel guilty because of a "Freudian Slip"
18,2,1,You need to accept that they're laughing with you, not at you.
21,4,1,Sure, no cholesterol, low fat, great potassium, but I still feel dissatisfied...
20,5,1,It depends on what your definition of "slip" is.
18,1,0,What caused you to slip?
32,6,6,Any guess why you feel empty inside?
19,4,0,I'm guessing you won't fall for the Freudian slip gag.
19,2,1,But what if you saw yourself as 'appealing' ?
33,8,1,Now, Mr. banana peel you said you like to give people the slip... tell me more about that.
18,3,0,Can we unpack this? I know that when you're stepped on people laugh, but why do you think they're laughing at you?
23,8,1,If you want to have a successful relationship, you need to stop giving people the slip
21,4,1,Was it Freudian?
33,10,6,So, you never got over the split?
27,11,3,''When things go bananas, make banana bread.''
18,0,1,Believe it or not, I too struggled for years to figure out whether I had appeal.
16,1,0,Wait, do you think you're not "a peeling" or not "appealing"?
22,4,1,So how do you feel about that particular monkey?
26,10,2,How long have you had this feeling of emptiness?
19,6,0,Believe me, beauty IS skin deep.
19,2,1,I just haven't been myself since we split.
19,2,1,A split personality is perfectly normal.
17,0,1,So, you're telling me that being slippery is just in your nature...
47,1,0,You have slipped backwards in your therapy. No, your advances towards me are not appealing , and I also disagree that hanging around with your friends has nothing to do with your current situation.
18,3,0,So what, you made a guy slip. You gonna stop living?
33,9,6,I think we're done here.
24,5,3,I'm just constantly getting stepped on, you know?
25,8,1,I've never felt more fruitless.
16,1,0,OK. You have a facade that you present to everyone. You are afraid that people will see you are empty inside. I think you would feel better if you just act. Slip out onto that sidewalk and make them laugh.
18,2,1,Now un-peal your emotions for me.
16,1,0,I understand that he fell, but it still doesn't count as a Freudian slip.
20,2,1,So, why are you feeling do empty?
38,4,0,How does it make you feel to be the cause of so much ridicule and public humiliation of slapstick comics?
27,5,3,Your confused? I'm talking to a banana with mother issues.
27,11,2,It's called an Oedipeel complex.
16,0,0,Bananas Foster could have been a good nickname. Top banana might not have been a great fit for you.
27,2,2,I don't think that's very funny.
20,2,1,And how does that make you peel... I mean, feel?
28,12,3,Do you think you WANTED him to slip?
26,13,2,Do you remember when you first experienced a feeling of emptiness?
53,32,15,You were saying you feel like an accident waiting to happen.
21,1,2,How long have you peeled this way?
21,5,0,I used to be the top banana in New Jersey
20,2,1,I think the issues with your mother stem from an oedipotassium complex.
17,2,0,Well what if the stability you provide is to audiences rather than pedestrians?
14,0,0,Sure, you have appeal, but you need to work on your inner slime.
14,2,0,Can you really blame yourself for her texting while walking?
16,1,0,Don't worry about it. It was only the result of a Freudian slip.
18,3,0,Listen Bud, I'm your analyst; NOT your sexual surrogate!
18,1,1,And when did you first realize you weren't appealing?
16,1,0,Usually my patients are just reduced to tears
22,3,1,This Rx should help that split personality
14,0,0,When did you start to feel different? When did you start to feel different?
16,1,0,You feel that no one takes you seriously.
17,2,0,You know Doc, I feel as though I've been slipping a lot lately.
21,4,1,And when did you first feel yourself slipping?
23,1,0,Do you want a Freudian interpretation?
18,1,0,Shrink: "So tell me why you feel you are the butt of too many jokes..." Banana Peel: "Well, it's kind of a slippery slope..."
31,11,3,Crazy crazy bo-bazy, banana-fana fo-fazy, fee-fy mo-mazy, crazy.
18,5,0,I'm having trouble getting any traction in my work.
15,0,0,What is troubling with you!
16,1,0,Appeal is not my issue, ma'am.
23,9,0,It's progress that you finally opened up to me!
22,7,1,What do you mean when you say you sometimes go bananas?
24,5,2,This void you feel, I'm afraid it is real.
40,16,5,Would you say it was an amicable split?
25,5,1,Tell me about your survivor guilt.
22,4,1,I'm glad that you've opened up to me, but let's try to keep this impersonal.
29,3,1,Try to think outside the cartoon box!
30,7,2,Then she said dating me was a slippery slope.
20,2,1,It's not funny when they fall on you!
140,97,83,You say you've been feeling empty since the split?
17,1,0,I said 'No!' But he just kept on peeling me." "What were you wearing?
20,6,0,Tell me why you feel life is slipping away.
30,26,1,I wouldn't say split personality
20,2,0,I feel so empty and used! I also sense a lack of purpose.
19,2,1,If you want to be known for your wit, you have to stay off the sidewalks.
24,9,1,It's time you acknowledge the split.
19,1,1,We're not likely to make any real progress if this is the way you are going to respond
25,8,2,You have a split personality.
16,0,1,A slip of the banana is not the fault of the mind.
24,4,2,I feel so empty inside, so very unapeeling.
34,11,7,I feel like I'm an accident waiting to happen.
19,4,0,Your castration anxiety may have been justified after all.
33,7,7,What makes you think people are avoiding you?
16,1,0,Have you always felt like a second?
22,5,2,It's not your fault that he slipped and everyone laughed.
30,1,6,If you were the Invisible _Gentleman_ you'd use a fig leaf.
24,11,0,We call those Freudian slips.
19,1,0,Actually that was just a regular slip.
31,5,7,Uh huh..., and how that make you peel?
23,7,1,Once and for all, it's never coming back.
26,8,3,I feel like such a cliche.
23,1,3,So should we talk about how horrible chimpanzees are?
22,1,1,I know it's unethical, but I just love the way you feel inside of me.
16,1,0,I don't think they're laughing at you, per se.
16,1,0,Why did you insist that we meet on a Sunday. Is this a joke to you?
23,9,1,And what makes you think you have a banana split personality?’
58,39,20,Somedays I feel like an accident just waiting to happen.
21,2,2,What about transitioning straight to mulch?
38,23,6,Let's discuss why you feel empty inside.
19,1,1,First off, you've got to stop blaming yourself.
27,8,4,Things have pretty much gone downhill since the end of vaudeville.
25,10,1,When you tried to embrace your inner self, you must have squeezed a little too hard!
15,0,0,So...when your "I want to be a pair of slippers" joke didn't work, was that the start of your bruising period?
26,11,2,You have a split personality disorder.
15,0,0,I'm tired of getting slipped on all the time
25,7,2,Doc, I have this fear of sidewalks
25,9,1,So, you and your wife just split?
24,6,2,I'm not trash !
22,3,2,Do you know when you started feeling empty?
18,4,0,Look, at least you're not a bad person ...
19,1,1,I aspired to be Bananas Foster but ended up in somebody's smoothie.
24,10,1,...and why do you find it funny to make people slip and fall?
28,8,4,I think we've peeled backed more than you can handle today.
27,15,2,I wonder if you unconsciously want people to slip and fall.
22,10,1,After you gave him the slip, what happened next?
15,0,0,I see. So you decided it was finally time to come out of the pocket.
15,0,0,Freudian slip -- not fruitian.
17,0,1,Let's leave the fruit behind, shall we?
17,2,0,Suddenly I feel more appealing.
16,1,0,And how many people have slipped on you?
23,5,1,Try to think of all those jokes you've appeared in as a form of popularity...
23,3,1,So how long do you think your friends have been finding you unappealing?
23,11,0,I've told you, my potassium levels are just fine.
18,3,0,What evidence do you have that you're no longer appealing?
22,1,1,Yes, I make a lot of money talking to banana peels.
20,5,1,It wasn't a Freudian slip, it was just a regular slip.
36,14,7,We all experience feelings of emptiness from time to time.
17,1,0,Passive aggression is still passive aggression!
33,16,6,They aren't laughing at you, they are laughing because of you.
26,1,1,How long have you been Trump's hair?
34,27,3,Why do you feel responsible for the downfall of so many people?
20,3,1,You mean, after all these sessions, you still feel stepped on?
22,5,0,So, you say that you find yourself slipping into depression?
31,11,2,I think what you're saying is, now that you've been eaten, your options are limited.
27,1,1,I don't care where you were last week.You still owe me 200.00.
22,2,0,I feel empty inside, and its unapeeling.
19,2,1,Sounds like separation anxiety. When did you first experience these feelings?
25,11,1,Have you ever heard of a Freudian slip-and-fall?
49,3,4,Psychoanalysis is a slippery slope but some find it a peeling.
20,7,0,I know you feel empty inside, but don't you think it's wrong to blame all gorillas?
27,15,1,Don't be so hard on yourself. You're not an accident waiting to happen.
24,6,2,So you dreamed I fell head over heels in love with you?
17,4,0,Peelings? I thought you were here to work on your feelings!
45,5,2,When did you first start having these hallucinations?
20,2,1,I just don't understand why I keep slipping everyone up.
23,4,2,Do you think you’re doing anything to contribute to this problem?
23,4,2,Our goal is to face slapstick without the guilt.
17,1,0,I thought you would be more appealing in my skin than in yours.
33,13,5,So, you feel the monkey just used you.
18,1,1,Since technically it was a patient that left you, I suppose I can bill you as a referral discount this one time
21,1,2,I told you to break a leg, not do it to the Oscar winning actor.
17,4,0,Sure, you miss the old bunch. But you'll always have 69 cents a pound.
37,17,3,Don't blame yourself; it was probably what we like to call a Freudian slip.
40,5,3,Oh, Dear! I didn't mean "literally."
20,2,1,You clearly have a case of banana split personality.
17,2,0,Careful, that's a slipper slope.
19,1,1,Let's peel back another layer and really dig into the meat of your issues.
25,8,2,When did you begin to feel you weren't top banana?
34,5,1,And when she said, "Sometimes a banana is just a good smoothie," how did that make you feel?
16,2,0,I'm just tired of always getting stepped on, you know?
18,4,0,I told you to stop monkeying around.
33,21,5,Okay, I understand. You were the top banana. And then what happened?
19,1,2,So, tell me, what makes you feel used an tossed aside ?
23,5,2,Sorry I can't see you anymore- I'm now limiting my practice to vegetables
22,7,1,Don't feel guilty - you were stepped on!
16,0,0,Sometimes I feel it's all just slipping away.
28,1,4,If I accept your premise that you are a monkey trapped in a man's body, will you get off the ceiling fan?
21,4,1,People just don't find me appealing.
23,5,2,It's not easy to come here and have your skin peeled back!
31,12,4,You can't blame your parents for being a GMO.
50,27,17,I’ll be honest. You’re an accident waiting to happen.
21,7,0,Why, what does a banana symbolize to you?
18,3,0,Most anyone in your position would feel like a discarded banana peel.
27,12,3,I hear you saying you feel empty inside.
15,0,0,I want you to understand that everything said here will be held in strict confidence.
17,4,0,Doc, I'm really just not peeling like myself lately...
22,5,1,What do you feel when you hear "banana split"?
27,12,3,It sounds like the issues started after your split.
18,6,0,Why do you always think it's your fault?
15,0,0,You're not fooling anyone, mr pendergraf.
15,0,0,So, tell me more about these self-induced fears.
22,4,1,There are a bunch of problems I want to talk about.
21,4,1,Try to work on pulling yourself together.
16,2,0,This should be easy. You don't HAVE an inner self. (set in itals, not caps).
22,3,2,So you think your divorce took a lot out of you?
17,1,0,So, your saying you weren't peeled like the rest of the bunch
40,17,9,So, he fell for you hard, and you find that funny?
24,9,1,Yes, I've heard that "Freudian slip" joke before...
44,8,3,How many times do I have to get stepped on before it's not funny anymore?
17,2,0,Mr. Wentworth, you can come out now I ate the Banana monster.
31,10,5,Is it possible you might be a Freudian slip?
18,2,1,I always feel this caption contest is rigged against me.
29,2,0,So you're feeling used, just a shell of your former self?
31,0,0,Please Chill Out Doc !
17,2,0,No. I don't feel like slipping on your peel.
16,0,0,This may stem from your fear of slipping
17,2,0,When did you begin to notice those around you slipping?
30,7,5,Not feeling comfortable in your own skin is actually quite common, Mr Plantain.
43,19,14,I tend to hurt people who get close to me.
26,10,2,You were saying you feel all eaten up inside. . .
26,10,2,In my diagnosis, I'd say you have 'split personality disorder.'
26,2,0,It sounds like you feel empty inside.
16,1,0,I know finding out you are actually a berry and do not grow on a tree is traumatic but...
20,3,0,Tell me about the first time you killed someone.
25,14,0,So why do you feel empty on the inside?
16,1,0,And you are sure it wasn't just a slip up?
20,0,1,Yes George, I recognize how this kind of redundancy only adds to your sense of futility.
21,3,0,Do you want to remain split with him?
20,4,1,Sounds like empty-peel syndrome.
21,7,1,And when she said, 'You're the cause of most accidents', how did that make you feel?
15,1,0,Do you ever feel that life has peeled away what dignity you had left?
10,1,0,I'm a bit concerned my patient finds me too a-peeling
24,2,3,That's not really what we consider a Freudian slip.
38,9,9,You can't blame yourself for every Freudian slip.
19,4,0,What's the deal banana peel?
19,0,1,"So why would you assume the keeper thinks you are still in the zoo"?
18,3,0,Many kids grow up fine in families without social standing or appeal.
33,9,6,It's not a homophobic slur, you are a fruit.
23,9,1,I think your depression stems from your dependence on slap stick.
18,3,0,Don't even think of coming at me with your sex appeal
16,2,0,Mr. B. it is a slippery slope.
55,42,14,And these women... They just fall for you?
16,0,0,"I asked if you had "Ben & Ann appeal"....!!!
20,6,0,My whole life is a slippery slope.
32,4,7,I've never put much stock in Freudian splits -- I mean slips.
18,4,0,So tell me again about your mother. She thought you were too ripe for your age?
46,19,4,So at this stage you feel there is nothing good inside of you/
19,1,1,In your case a paranoid fear of body snatchers may not be unreasonable.
20,0,0,I feel like I'm slipping out of line
18,4,0,Doc, I feel like a shell of my former self. I'm empty inside.
19,5,0,Well, despite what you have been told, I think you are certainty a-peeling.
30,7,4,I seem to have lost my purpose in life.
20,3,1,So, when did you notice things beginning to slip around you?
22,3,2,Don't look at my legs and I won't look at your skin.
18,1,0,Why do you believe that I am the one who should be psychoanalyzed?
16,1,0,And what are your views on female politicians?
16,1,0,It may sound bananas, but we need to make a fruitful appeal to your split personalities.
16,0,0,How long have you had sexual attraction to other flowers
17,1,0,When did you first experience agoraphobia?
21,3,1,I don't think you need a psychiatrist to find your inner self, you'll need a detective.
47,3,1,Too bad it's not in his hand.
24,2,3,You're not bananas; it's OK to feel empty inside.
20,3,1,What can I say? I slipped up with a younger peel and the wife split. It's all so cliche.
16,3,0,It's okay; I am used to Freudian slips in here.
26,6,2,Well you may have lost your inner self, but you still have appeal
18,3,0,At your age it's normal to slip a little.
15,0,0,tell me more about this serial killer
20,2,1,How do you feel when they call you, "slippery"?
32,11,6,Banana fanna fo........sorry.
35,10,6,I couldn't help it,doc, she was getting under my skin.
19,2,1,Fee, fie, fofamma what?
19,2,1,Don't tell me you had another Freudian slip!
20,6,0,...and why do you feel it's a slippery slope?
20,7,0,I know — it's not funny when people avoid you.
17,2,0,So, you think others find you not a peeling?
16,1,0,An orange is round just like an apple. Why can't it be apples and bananas?
18,0,1,Don't judge yourself by those who slip on you.
15,1,0,Mr. Dole, I can help you peel away those concerns. Let's begin with your lack of taste. I hear that you develop this problem when you travel long distances?
48,6,1,Has seeing a male psychotherapist ever appealed to you?
18,1,1,So when was your last Freudian slip?
21,2,1,So you’ve lost touch with your inner self, you’re a danger to others --and you think you’re still appealing?
36,6,0,So people think you are slippery?
29,9,3,And then they called me 'yella'.
22,7,0,why do you feel you are not appealing
19,0,0,Well if you'er frustrated bc "Well, I'm sorry, but if you're depressed because you can not find a straight partner, this will require multiple sessions to resolve."
18,4,0,Your survivor's guilt over the fate of your 'better half' is unhealthy.
27,13,2,Have you always felt this comfortable in your own skin?
21,5,1,Have you attempted suicide before?
24,8,3,I'm afraid my lunch hour is almost up.
28,14,2,I see something has been eating you from inside
35,11,5,So you're saying that you feel used.
17,0,1,Of course you feel 'empty inside.' Your life cycle is ending.
16,0,0,You are gonna be paying for this couch too, you know.
21,4,1,I'm tired of being the scapegoat.
14,0,0,I'm afraid my diagnosis peels back nothing slipperier than a split personality.
21,4,1,So, you were once a large phallic symbol. But you gave that away for the starring role in a dessert flambé. Now, you are an empty shell and spend your days causing falls. Tell me, Mr. Peele, have you considered running for President?
19,4,0,How long ago did you notice that you went bananas?
24,6,2,Let's start with your abandonment issues
20,1,1,Feelings are like onions.
24,6,2,It's not your fault the family is a bunch of losers
25,3,2,You know, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
22,3,2,It's just that I feel so empty inside....
18,4,0,So, what I hear you saying is though you take no joy in the misfortune of others, you feel it's your responsibility to be the integral component in the schadenfraude equation?
19,2,1,Do you think falling down is actually funny?
23,5,1,Today let's discuss why you feel so unappealing.
16,1,0,So you deny responsibility, saying the doctor’s fall was a Freudian slip?
39,10,2,Anything you say about a slip and fall lawsuit will be strictly confidential.
37,13,8,Why do you feel that you're an accident waiting to happen?
15,0,0,I preferred the potato. It's not a banana lounge.
27,7,2,She used to put me in the refrigerator.
21,4,1,You're looking for assurance that you still have appeal, but isn't that a slippery slope?
28,9,3,What do you mean they don't find you appealing?
15,1,0,Have you considered all the possible causes of your situation?
16,1,0,Psychiatrist: "How do you peel?" Banana Peel: "I'm slipping at life."
20,5,1,Tell me more about feeling empty
20,5,0,Now about this sense you have that people are falling all over you ...
51,16,17,Perhaps you misunderstood when she said she was going to slip on something a little nicer.
17,2,0,You've been here over an hour and haven't said a thing. How am I supposed to help you?
21,1,2,And how does that make you feel, appealing?
23,3,2,So you've felt a strong loss of purpose ever since the decline of vaudeville?
22,3,2,Do you really believe that there is no such thing as an accident?
33,15,5,So, it really was a banana in his pocket.
17,2,0,So what unpeeled you this time?
23,5,1,You're overthinking things - it was just a minor slip-up.
21,6,0,So when did you first notice this feeling of emptiness?
38,10,7,I know, but eventually we're all compost.
20,3,1,No, I will not slip into something more comfortable.
28,10,3,I just haven't been the same since the split.
6,0,1,Opening up...finally.
31,17,3,You're really opening up today, that's a good thing.
22,2,2,The correct pronunciation is still "flak´sid," but do go on.
37,12,2,It's pretty clear that no longer being top banana is eating you up inside.
21,2,1,Your not the only one. Oranges, Grapefruit and Avocados go through the same thing.
25,6,2,Tell me: what's been eating away at you?
22,3,1,So you feel people are always slipping up?
28,8,3,Why do you think people walk all over you?
22,7,1,But why do you think you feel so empty inside?
25,6,1,So, why do you think it would be fruitless to try?
15,0,0,We could plead life?
43,33,17,I've felt rotten since the split.
21,2,2,Well, so much for self-actualization.
15,0,0,So, you think you're no longer a peeling.
23,5,2,And how did the split make you feel?
19,1,1,Among bananas, "penis envy" is exceedingly rare.
18,3,0,I see your inner you decided to skip our session.
25,1,0,The world is slipping away from me
26,6,3,Your split personality took me aback.
31,9,5,This is how you feel once we have peeled back all of the layers.
21,2,0,So in a way, these constants slips are self sabotage?
24,6,2,You want to do Shakespeare, but you are typecast. And how does that make you feel?
28,5,4,So, when did you first have this feeling that people were avoiding you?
16,1,0,How long have you been a stalker?
25,7,3,Which hurts more: When people walk all over you? Or the laughter?
19,2,1,And you say you made a Freudian slip?
15,0,0,I said, "make lemonade".
26,2,0,I just can't figure out what this peeling is...
17,2,0,So, how did you discover that it's "appeal" and not "a peel"?
29,6,6,...and then, I was skinned alive...
21,3,1,Someone steped on me but it was a "Freudian Slip".
19,3,0,I've tried Viagra and Cialis, nothing works. She slipped out of our apartment.
18,0,1,Why do you believe you're a vaudevillian at heart?
25,16,1,So, tell me about the emptiness you say you're feeling.
18,2,1,So they said "Ba NA na na NA na" and just TOOK it?!?
20,4,1,Things just haven't been the same since hover boards.
20,5,1,How often do you feel like this?
22,6,0,You say you feel Kafkaesque?
16,0,0,You say you are unappealing. When do you first remember having these feelings?
21,3,1,Now that you're no longer a phallic symbol, do you still feel you have a skin in the game?
24,4,3,It sounds like you feel like you're losing your grip on things, is that correct?
17,3,0,So, you've felt empty ever since your split?
26,2,4,And then, what did Josephine Baker say?
22,6,1,Your wife has no reason to be jealous of me. Have HER psychiatrist check her potassium levels.
23,4,0,Yes, a midlife career change can be stressful.
19,1,1,I'm not clear on your reference to a Freudian slip.
28,3,4,I'm sorry for your loss.
26,1,2,What is a brown or black oxford?
26,7,3,No I won't let you crawl under my shoe.
21,1,0,Even though you turned over a new leaf, you're still invisible to me.
37,11,8,I'm sorry it ended in a split.
17,3,0,You must stop blaming yourself for their falls.
44,7,14,"Orange who"?
34,10,7,So let's get back to these feelings of responsibility for causing both pain and laughter.
22,6,3,Keep taking the medicine. I'll give you another prescription for the side effects.
15,0,0,Dr. I don't even know how to respond to your blatant sexual advances... I feel so empty.
24,4,2,I'm always typecast as the slippery guy
17,2,0,How about selling slippers as a career change for yourself?
34,14,6,I'm sure everyone's life feels like a bad joke at some point.
22,5,1,I know you have a peel, but it is not good for your mental health to think that everyone falls for you.
16,1,0,I CAN'T GET OVER MY GUILT AT MAKING DR. FREUD SLIP
23,2,3,We call it "phantom banana syndrome"
19,2,0,I peel like a joke.
26,3,1,Whenever I feel pressure, I slip things up.
21,7,0,It all started in Ecuador! I was the smallest of the bunch.........!
24,5,2,Everyone is waiting for me to slip up.
16,4,0,Let's unpeel that.
19,1,1,Bobo, are you still there?
20,6,0,Well, Chiquita, another hour has slipped by.
16,0,0,That's not what I meant when I said be the change you want to see.
29,17,3,And yet people continue to walk all over you.
22,3,2,Unfortunately at your age I don't think you'll ever recover what you've lost.
17,3,0,Lets unpack why you think you are responsible for every split in your relationships.
16,1,0,And when Freud stepped on you, how did that make you feel?
29,5,1,No . . . I don’t think it was a Freudian slip.
17,3,0,I just feel like a mere peel of my former self.
32,11,6,Let me guess. You feel empty.
28,8,3,Why do you think you chose a therapist with high heels?
27,1,1,So tell me - how are you peeling today?
19,2,1,Let's discuss last week's Freudian slip.
18,4,0,At least we've taken care of your castration anxiety.
17,2,0,Let's peel away and get to the fruit of your problem.
32,7,5,You were consumed by the split?
36,26,5,I found the inner you to be delicious.
19,1,0,They said I was ready. Now I feel as if someone stripped my dignity right out of me.
19,4,0,It's not your fault the guy slipped.
21,4,2,That empty feeling could take you down a slippery slope...
15,1,0,There you go, peel back all your masks.
26,14,2,So she dumped you for the top banana?
41,3,0,"Mr. Wilson, it is true. Bananas and bacon are not longer in flavor.
17,2,0,'Tell me when this feeling of being slippery began.'
17,5,0,Maybe you should try being the victim for once, and see how that feels.
29,9,4,On the bright side, someone really enjoyed that banana daiquiri.
23,5,2,You don't have to let your mother's split personality define you.
25,7,2,If you say 'Freudian slip' one more time I'm ending our session early.
26,2,4,It was horrible ... I was being skinned and eaten alive.
41,14,11,I've been feeling very empty since the split
17,2,0,I think I'm responsible for the Freudian Slip
39,21,8,But ask yourself: Are all these ladies falling for you? Or, are they simply falling?
20,5,1,But you're more than a peeling.
19,0,2,But the situation with Inky and Blotchy was completely different.
19,3,0,So you find life to be slipping away from you?
21,4,1,We don't use the "B" word in psychotherapy.
33,1,1,The end of the session can be awkward. Oftentimes the analyst has to bear with her patient as he confronts the realization that he is not what he thinks he is.
22,2,1,You really must try to come to grips with the reality that it will never grow back.
24,1,0,Paleolithic memory? Forget it.
28,8,4,He told me I'd lost my appeal, and then he split.
25,7,2,When did you first realize that you had a foot fetish?
44,19,13,We try not to use the word 'bananas'
24,4,3,I swear if they are going to stick a "gluten free" sticker on me I will lose my mind.
30,1,1,What makes you think it was your fault?
23,8,1,You say your father thinks you're a joke.
39,27,7,Tell me about your relationship before the split.
26,10,2,Did the split end badly?
31,8,4,You've got to stop seeing yourself as a second banana.
27,7,2,How would you actually feel, though, if I agreed to step on you?
20,1,1,Excuse me, sir, but your session is not quite finished. Are you trying to give me the "slip?"
23,4,2,I can't believe I slipped up like that.
28,11,3,Yes you really are appealing but as your doctor I'm going to just let that slip.
47,19,15,I can see by your colouring that our time is up.
15,0,0,Lover? Sorry to disappoint you. According to Jung, I believe 'Jester' would more appropriate.
21,4,1,So, you feel that others around you are slipping, but not you?
37,10,8,Don't over analyze it. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
20,3,0,Since our last session, I see you decided to take my advice and release your inner banana.
24,8,2,I've been feeling quite empty lately.
19,5,0,You're in a pickle?
20,3,0,I'm sorry, you are right, I shouldn't refer to it as a slip. Would you please elaborate about your relapse.
24,6,2,Tell me about life since the split.
19,2,1,You say you are bringing everyone around you down?
20,1,1,I didn't say your were bananas, I meant you must be bananas
20,0,1,You feel that you hurt everything you touch.
43,22,10,Well you're off the floor now, and that's progress.
15,1,0,Nobody anywhere, ever, takes you seriously?
12,0,0,You feel useless because someone hasn't tripped over you?
30,11,4,I get the sense that people avoid me.
43,11,0,So, you were torn from the bunch at an unripe age. How did that make you peel?
20,5,0,In order to fully communicate what we feel inside we must peel away at the guard we have been holding up to truly convey our emotions.
18,2,1,Some people say they have one foot on you like it's a bad thing?
15,3,2,Something's eating you up inside.
19,4,0,So it sounds as if you're starting to have second thoughts about the gender surgery?
15,0,0,I always get blamed.
17,0,0,.... regardless, I don't patients.
18,3,0,Do you want to talk about your feeling of being so stepped upon?
28,14,2,Why do YOU think all your friends are all slipping away?
19,4,0,You might be interested to know that my other clients who are living with banana-split-personality disorder tend to self-medicate--with toppings and the like.
112,104,73,I am required to report those bruises.
23,2,2,Thanks, Obamacare!
24,3,1,You can't take it personally that they say it's what's on the inside that matters.
17,2,0,So I take it that with your addiction you've had another slip.
18,3,0,Your inner self was soft and fragrant. Tell me more about your exterior. Is it...slippery?
14,0,0,Poor parenting is getting pushed from the nest while you are still in the egg.
20,3,1,Now that I've eaten your inner self, I suppose there's not much left to discuss...
16,1,0,And what did Mr. Freud say after you made him slip?
41,19,10,Calm down, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
17,1,0,Keep telling yourself that your slippery reputation is greatly outweighed by your health benefits.
24,3,3,And why do you always refer to Monkey's as bastards ?
17,1,0,So tell me, do you find me sexy and appealing?
21,5,1,I still feel terrified whenever someone mentions monkeys, or zoos.
31,10,5,I'm just tired of people stepping all over me!
25,0,0,Therapist to Mr. Banana Peel: Wow! That is a tough situation! I really peel for you.
14,0,0,jklfsad;jkl
18,4,0,Why do you think people find you slippery?
33,10,4,Tell me more about your split.
17,6,0,So, you're still feeling empty?
27,12,3,Yes, but you can't let "slippery" define who you are.
23,4,2,I just feel so hollow inside.
16,2,0,I understand your separation anxiety when you split.
25,8,0,It feels like life is just slipping by.
17,2,0,I wasn't your fault. Accidents happen.
22,3,2,So how much has this separation cost you?
22,3,2,I just feel so lonely since she split.
15,0,0,As your therapist and a woman, I do find you appealing.
20,1,2,At first I thought you might be suffering from a split personality, but now I’ve come to believe that you are a slippery, thin skinned, hollow shell of a fruit case.
19,1,1,Of course you feel altered, but appeal is still appeal.
29,12,7,Someone will fall for you eventually
18,3,0,When did you start experiencing this feeling of emptiness?
51,27,15,When did you first suspect that she only loved you for your potassium?
20,3,1,And for how long have you been wanting to make a Freudian slip?
18,4,0,Tell me how it feels to be skinned.
15,1,0,Donald we all agreed that having a woman therapist would be part of your therapy. Now you run off leaving me only your banana peel.
23,2,0,Keeping a straight face with this client proved challenging. Whenever he expressed longing for a life partner, Dr. Jane couldn't help recalling that 'pair of slippers' punchline.
27,14,2,You need to stop blaming yourself for the slip ups of others.
17,0,1,So how did that little Freudian slip make you feel?
19,2,1,So, when did you begin to regret making people slip and break their necks?
19,4,0,I've got a thick skin but nothing left inside. That is the price of leadership!
35,4,1,Mm-hmm..and can you describe what makes you feel used now?
42,22,11,Bringing others down will never fill your emptiness.
51,24,14,How long have you been feeling rotten?
31,10,3,So......how long have you had this feeling that you are always being stepped on.....?
18,2,0,Please tell me how do you peel since our last session
21,2,2,I understand you feel empty, but you are appealing.
18,2,0,I think it's time to stop blaming your mother.
21,3,0,I thought our marriage was as good as a sundae but she wanted a split.
15,0,0,Monsieur Banana, please tell me your improved Potassium concentration since our last psychiatric session?
16,1,0,Between the two of us, I feel we can get you pulled back together
17,1,0,Have you ever considered your slippery personality to be the cause?
17,3,0,Were you peeling any better after last week's session?
16,4,0,Let's explore why you feel all eaten up inside.
17,2,0,So you feel like the scapegoat?
20,7,0,Transitioning into observational comedy is a slippery slope.
17,2,0,So you say you're solo act isn't working?
18,3,0,Why do you think you're empty inside?
18,1,0,Such are the dreams of the everyday housewife.
20,6,0,And you're afraid people think you have split personality?
18,1,1,Sometimes a cucumber is just a cucumber.
38,3,1,Do you think, perhaps, at some at some level, your mother's inability to express affection, and not your comedic impulse, might be behind your need to be stepped on?
24,5,0,What is it that makes you feel so empty inside ?
52,20,17,Normally, I only take nut jobs.
33,11,4,They're not laughing at you. They're laughing BECAUSE of you.
32,1,0,You said before you were going to stop letting things slip.
18,3,0,Is this your way of saying you find me appealing?
22,4,0,You seem to have a twisted sense related to your sex appeal!
15,0,0,So the word 'schlepped' bothers you?'
30,7,5,Can you describe your peelings?
31,12,5,What did you expect? You fell in love with a monkey!
52,4,1,Yes, that must've been difficult... how close were you before learning the banana bread wasn't gluten free?
31,15,4,You know how it is...... one slip and you're no longer top banana.
16,2,0,I feel your castration anxiety may, in fact, be justified.
27,5,4,Take your time. I'm comfortable with silence.
32,13,4,Well, it's not REALLY all about who you are on the inside.
18,4,0,What makes you think you were rejected?
23,7,1,And you're convinced that if people don't avoid you then something terrible could happen?
18,2,0,I know I make you feel empty inside but let's focus on how you felt before I put you in the blender.
36,11,9,And when someone does fall, how does that make you feel?
18,3,0,Everyone feels used and abandoned at some point in their life.
27,4,3,And just what makes you think you're not appealing?
26,3,2,My friends think I have appeal, but my enemies say I'm a slippery character
40,7,2,Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
18,3,0,Last week, we discussed pulling back your skin to show your true self. How did that go this week?" "Well...
21,1,2,You'll always be appealing.
18,2,0,You feel as though you're split in half, with a vast, creamy coldness separating you from yourself.
25,8,2,Why do You think you always hurt the ones around you?
32,15,5,We all get stepped on.
25,11,1,Pull your self together. By: Tommy Gibbons, Age 11
23,1,2,These days, we'd say you have 'dissociative identity disorder'.
25,8,1,Is that a banana peel on my couch? Or are you just glad to see me?
18,1,0,So you're saying you feel guilty you let someone slip on you.
19,2,1,Tell me why you think you no longer are 'appealing'?
23,5,1,No one will step on me . . .
21,4,1,So just face it, you're a slip and fall lawyer born in the wrong body.
17,4,0,I'm guessing she slipped away as well.
16,1,0,I can see you're empty on the inside, but to move forward we need to find the core issue here.
17,2,0,And the guy dumped you for a gerbil?
22,6,1,Yes, it is possible to have a good split.
22,8,0,How does that make you peel ... sorry, I mean feel?
29,4,4,Who's there?
26,5,3,Do you have ANY idea what it's like to be stepped on by everyone and then get blamed for their problems?!? No. I didn't think so. By the way...nice shoes.
21,9,0,You can't keep letting people get under your skin.
23,5,2,Do you feel empty in your own skin?
34,14,6,'I'm pleased to see you've picked yourself up off the floor.'
15,0,0,Not to worry. You really are the top banana.
13,0,0,How do you feel about being DISCARDED
24,10,2,Why do you think you bruise so easily?
17,4,0,Again, let's discuss why your wife thinks you're yellow, slippery, and can't be trusted."
27,12,3,So, you feel like you are always blamed when someone slips up.
17,4,0,And...how long have you had this empty feeling inside?
25,2,2,You are my favorite patient, so I slipped on something comfortable.
30,5,4,So you were saying you used to be bananas?
40,18,9,Would it be that bad if you were always a second banana?
19,3,0,So, they laughed at you when he slipped on you?
19,1,1,It's healthy to peal away your inner self and not go bananas.
21,6,1,That's getting into a slippery slope.
10,1,0,Explain what you mean by "everything is slipping away"
18,4,0,you procrastinated and did not pay your slip & fall premium ?
21,5,1,So you're telling me that you think people walk all over you.
25,7,3,And how do the bruises and the emptiness make you feel?
18,2,0,Sometimes we all feel a little "used up and worthless"........
15,0,0,What's got you split up? Let's see if we can peel away the issues.
21,5,1,Was that a slip, or are you holding yourself responsible?
19,7,0,Will these bruises ever heal?
22,6,1,So your last relationship left you feeling empty . . .
16,0,0,So, how do you "pheel" about the fact that she dumped you so easily after taking care of her all this time?
23,8,1,Yes, I can see how that was very emasculating.
17,4,0,Hmm, I guess that was a banana in his pocket.
21,4,1,I don't think they're laughing AT you, they're laughing BECAUSE of you
33,16,2,So tell me - when did you split?
32,13,5,You seem to be suffering from separation anxiety.
35,14,7,Let's talk about the monkey incident.
20,5,1,I've never heard of a Freudian slip and fall. What's that like for you?
19,2,1,I heard you've got a monkey on your back
23,5,2,Tell me more about your feeling empty inside.
18,0,1,I already told you my approach is Jungian.
56,32,20,So when did you first begin to feel like garbage?
40,6,2,I get no respect. One slip and fall and they never let you forget it.
31,9,5,I took your advice and opened up to people, but ended up getting stepped on.
20,6,0,Doc, I'm in a bit of a slippery situation.
29,14,5,Where was your Republic located
24,4,2,Sounds like a case of separation anxiety.
33,12,3,Say more about this feeling of emptiness you have.
40,8,0,Why do you feel you’re really a mango trapped in a banana peel?
17,1,1,You think people are laughing at you?
22,5,2,It's been real,baby,but I gotta split.
17,3,0,Of course you feel discarded and useless, but you have value, you do!
22,6,0,It must be hard to avoid feeling discarded.
15,3,0,Feel free to peel away your inner banana.
25,9,2,I thought it was a minor slip-up.
31,6,6,All men ever want is to slip with me.
24,8,2,nd how long have you felt like an accident waiting to happen?
18,4,0,But tell me, how do you really peel?
20,4,0,I think you're opening up, but we need to peel back a few more layers to uncover the source of your problems.
23,5,1,You present quite literally. You have a split personality disorder.....
29,7,5,So tell me, when was it that you began to peel this way?
47,32,13,It's quite normal to feel empty after a split.
27,10,2,How did you feel when he threw you aside?
27,4,4,Stop blaming yourself. It's not your fault people step on you.
19,4,0,Talk some more about your feelings of people slipping away from you.
29,1,0,Sometimes I don't know about you.
19,7,0,When we started you were green with envy, then you were yellow-bellied, and now this limp emptiness--I'm not sure you want to make progress.
25,6,0,How did you feel when the fruit flies surrounded Sonny?
27,8,0,On impulse, I agreed to a split, and now I'm desolate.
37,3,0,Clowns always leave the most amusing insights.
19,4,0,I'm hearing that those you love are all slipping away from you.
17,1,0,I'm just a shell of the man I used to be, doctor..

21,8,0,I feel my appeal is slipping, Doctor
18,0,0,Look. I don't think that just because you wear yellow, that you must drive the Truly Nolen car, but then, that just my personal opinion.

20,3,1,My mother mother My mother also had a split personality.
22,5,2,Ah, well, that's a bit of a slippery slope.
16,1,0,You're so passive-aggressive.
22,3,1,I have a recurring dream where I'm making everyone fall...
33,9,1,You shouldn't compare yourself to that young kale smoothie. You have your own value.
15,1,0,No, it is not because you are seen as just an empty suit.
16,2,0,Define your definition of a slip-up.
17,2,0,everyone thinks it's so funny to walk all over me and they never question how it might make ME feel...
15,0,0,So you feel your life is just slipping away?

18,0,1,Ignore that, please. It was a slip, that's all.
43,24,11,Everyone who comes here thinks they're bananas.
21,1,1,Perhaps is time to branch out as an actor and try other roles?
30,9,4,I just ate your banana, how does that make you feel?
29,13,3,That's one way to open up.
17,3,0,I really don't think you need to doubt your appeal to anyone.
17,2,0,Don't be too hard on yourself - we all slip sometimes.
32,13,3,Sorry--am I getting under your skin?
21,0,1,I remember when I slipped into you.
22,6,1,How long have you felt your appeal was slipping.
28,12,3,Maybe try opening up from the other end.
38,16,8,When did you first learn you weren't organic?
39,23,7,You need to find your inner self.
30,1,1,No, no Mr Houdini, I meant peel of your outer clothing only.
17,2,0,It hurts. All I ever hear is 'It's what's on the inside that counts'.
18,1,0,Doctor, I don't understand why women don't find me a-peeling.
19,4,2,Let's talk about your fear of falling.
14,3,0,At what age did you start wanting to hurt people ?
16,0,0,You were so...there.
16,0,0,Tell me more about this feeling of rejection
32,12,5,It's not a trust issue, I always sit like this.
16,0,0,How about we go back to your taking metaphors literally?
16,1,0,Is that Freudian?
17,0,0,All I suggested to you is to meditate in the lotus position, which has nothing to do with the ancient spell transforming a person into a lotus !
18,1,0,I'm sure that was just a slip of the tongue.
21,5,1,Yes, we have no banana. Sorry to disappoint you.
28,4,2,You're tired of slippery jokes, I get that; but let's peel back another layer.
15,0,0,Is that a poison banana skin?
16,1,0,Banana: "Why don't you pull your skirt up also?"
47,5,1,Get over it! I'm a little bananas too after dealing with you guys all day.
22,5,2,I think it's a little too late for Viagra.
21,4,1,It sounds to me like people weren't laughing at YOU so much as they were laughing at the entire situation.
16,2,1,No, I keep telling you, that was not a Freudian slip. Maybe it's time you looked for another analyst.
18,2,0,Just be glad I'm not a cigar.
17,2,0,Why do you think you're sadistic?
29,9,0,So what time of the day do you find yourself more appealing?

27,4,4,I can't listen to any more. Daylight come and me wanna go home.
22,5,1,You're going to have to start taking yourself seriously first.
30,6,4,Do you think other people ever feel empty inside?
18,3,0,Even for me, it's hard to believe you've tripped that many people.
18,4,1,I don't know Doc, I keep slipping up.
21,2,0,We need to work on that obsession--and no, I'm not wearing one.
19,2,0,Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes, it's what you feel missing inside.
17,3,0,What makes you feel empty inside?
20,6,0,Why do you feel you're just a shell of your former self
28,7,2,So, have you always thought of yourself as 'appealing'?
19,1,1,So you've lost your banana. You're still appealing.
29,10,4,It sounds as though you're easily bruised.
55,27,11,I'm afraid you're suffering from a split personality.
48,32,20,You need to stop blaming yourself for everyone else's slip-ups.
17,4,0,Don't blame yourself for slipping up - it happens to the best of us.
18,3,0,It's not always your fault.
23,4,2,I assure you it's off the record; you can slip away at any time.
25,9,2,How long have you felt all eaten up inside?

15,0,0,Let's start from the beginning.
18,4,0,For a phallic symbol, you're a disgrace.
33,7,2,Don't feel bad. Fruedian slips are not your fault.
30,8,5,You have what we call 'banana envy.'
22,8,2,No, those slips aren't Freudian.
36,5,0,Funny, yet dangerous. Maybe I have a split personality.
16,1,0,Is that what I think it is!?
15,0,0,So... tell me again... you think the producer of "Marriage at first Sight" used you...... and you want to sue for "shallow jocularity?......"
16,2,0,Would the split have been better without whipped cream?
22,6,1,Let's begin by peeling off the layers.
23,8,1,Your peel is open.
21,3,2,How do you peel about that- ugh, sorry, trigger word. My mistake.
18,3,0,You give new meaning to a "Freudian slip".
21,5,0,Tell me again how she loved your inner beauty.
28,9,3,When did you first feel you'd become cliché?
20,2,1,Being "organic" is causing problems at work?
28,5,3,We need to address your split personality disorder.
23,9,1,Let go of the guilt. They didn't watch where they were going.
30,15,4,How did that make you peel? Feel -- I mean feel. I promise that wasn't a Freudian slip...
24,3,3,This Trump hairpiece idea is a delusion.
21,3,1,Your openness is what makes you appealing.
26,9,0,We've been making progress, but lately it seems that you're slipping a little.
20,5,1,What makes you think that your life is merely a punchline to one big joke?
21,7,1,Calm down, this whole 'irony' fad will pass; slap-stick will be back and bigger than ever.
16,1,0,When the husband claims his wife has daily pms and needs counseling but doesnt realize he's the one with the split personality.
18,4,0,Did the other splits cause this much anxiety ?
20,6,0,So when did you discover just how slippery Life can be??
18,4,2,You've lost that loving peeling.
31,7,4,People see you as a walking joke?
13,0,0,Tell me your thoughts and let me peel apart your brain
21,9,0,I'm referring you to another therapist who does not have food issues.
23,12,0,For how long have you felt that something is missing?
40,12,10,Do you identify as a banana or a plantain?
37,14,7,But you didn't actually cause a Freudian slip.
21,6,1,How did you peel after our last session?
33,9,6,Tell me about your nana, Nana Beau Bana.
18,3,0,And how did it feel to be called a fruit?
29,2,0,So you feel that the split was a result of your yellowing complexion...
21,6,1,Let's find a better way to say "crazy".
20,3,1,You have a lot of a-peel.
16,3,0,Exactly what makes you think that even I am avoiding you?
22,5,1,Sometimes a slip is just a slip.
18,0,0,I can tell you are just crushed on the inside aren't you.
24,3,1,You seem split about your relationship.
18,3,0,So, you feel like you were thrown away?
22,5,1,Let's explore why your mother found you unappealing.
16,2,0,Just how many do you feel have banana envy?
19,2,1,So how does always getting stepped on make you feel?
26,6,3,I've always thought of myself as pretty easy to get along with but lately it seems like everyone feels the need to be overly cautious when they see me.
20,3,1,She said I have no guts and now I feel empty inside. You know what I mean?
16,1,0,Stop blaming yourself.
22,1,1,I hear you saying that you feel eaten up inside and just thrown aside to rot.
25,5,3,I understand that not *every* slip is a Freudian slip.
23,9,1,Are you feeling empty inside?
15,0,0,Let's not go there, in your case, Oedipus complexes is a slippery slope.
20,4,0,I hate it when people assume I only speak Spanish. I am really an educated Banana.
25,9,2,So, since when have you had this hollow feeling.
15,0,0,MY GOD YOU ATE THE BANNANA AND NOW YOUR HIM !
30,11,4,So when did you first get the feeling that people were walking all over you?
24,6,5,You're not trash. You're compost!
18,3,0,How long have you obsessed about being a Chiquita fruit bowl?
19,4,0,It's been a slippery slope. They keep falling head over heels for me.
17,1,0,Making people slip on the sidewalk still makes you an important contributing member of society.
28,4,5,It's not at all unusual for peels to have banana envy.
30,3,7,When he slipped, how did that make you feel?
32,22,4,I'm afraid you have a split personality
14,0,0,Chaise longues are great, but I prefer hammocks.
36,28,4,Do you think it's in your nature to bring people down?
15,0,0,So all of your relationships end up hitting rock bottom?
28,12,3,Let’s analyze your nightmare about being covered in ice cream.
16,0,0,I see. We'll try to help you not laugh about pratfalls.
25,10,2,But you ARE empty inside.
21,3,0,I have a vindictive nature
20,6,1,One more Freudian slip joke and this session is over.
19,4,0,You're the second banana split personality I've seen today.
32,2,7,So, at first, you found him appealing...?
42,7,0,Please forgive me. I peeled away your vulnerable facade and devoured your inner self.
22,7,1,Why do you think you caused the accident?
17,2,0,You shouldn't feel guilty just because people slip on you.
16,1,0,You shouldn't keep blaming yourself for other people's slips.
21,1,2,I could see how you would think you are causing her to slip into old habits.
16,1,0,You say your Freudian slips suddenly multiplied just before you went totally bananas?
23,7,1,...and you feel responsible for your parents split?
26,9,3,Usually there's something there when I peel back the layers.
33,12,7,You aren't responsible for other people's accidents.
37,16,7,Quit blaming yourself for other people's slip-ups.
19,3,0,Have you been feeling emty on the inside lately?
20,4,1,My diagnosis is that you fear everyone you meet is going to fall down.
16,1,0,Well on the plus side, you got a peel!
19,3,1,It's just a confidence issue Doc, in social circles I feel like I'm always being stepped on, and you know with my history that I can't afford another slip-up.
22,6,1,What can I say, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
21,7,1,So you have the mind of a mango, but the body of a banana?
20,0,1,Stop hiding behind your excoriations and rise up to your expectations!
21,5,1,I’m afraid that spending yet another session focusing on your abandonment issues may prove fruitless.
18,0,1,I told you I was a witch, doctor -- what do you have to say now?
25,7,2,You say your mother loved apples, pears and peaches but not you?
29,9,2,I seem to have lost my inner self.
44,7,2,I'm sorry to hear about the decline of your appearance in comedy acts, but you should know that political correctness is killing your genre.
49,11,7,Do you consider yourself to be low, average or high in potassium?
20,4,0,You feel unjustly neglected in the history of the Freudian Slip. Tell me more.
26,8,2,Let's keep this professional. You're in no way appealing to me.
16,2,0,No, you can't peel me!
33,19,4,And after you "went soft," then what?
48,30,14,You need to stop cereal dating.
23,7,1,Then she got all nuts, so I split.
26,7,2,I have this empty feeling inside.
16,0,0,You are literally the first banana to have marital issues. Also what day is it?
36,19,6,I would say you have a 'split personality'.
22,4,1,You are suffering from P.T.S.D. You witnessed him being cut up and put into a cereal bowl.
26,2,2,Blaming someone else for your own emptiness is a slippery slope.
21,3,2,I think it's time you stopped trying to understand you're a peel, and just accept it.
21,6,0,Another slip up?
23,7,1,I said, "Reveal your INNER self!
18,2,0,I can assure you you're not the cause of any Freudian Slip
18,3,0,And that's why we split.
37,5,2,How long have you been feeling you life's a joke?
18,2,0,You seem confused why some people find you appealing and then just toss you away. When did these feelings first slip up on you?
20,1,0,And they told me a minor in Animal Behavior would be pointless.
21,6,1,How long have you felt that you were more of a plantain?
28,11,3,50% of all bananas split.
21,5,1,Keep hanging out with that bunch and you'll lose your core value.
26,6,3,I just don't find myself appealing anymore.
16,1,0,Maybe ED is not the best term for this sense of loss you're feeling.
17,4,0,So Mr. Dole, what do you mean by "going bananas"?
27,9,3,So, when did you first realize that you were an orange in a banana's body?"
28,8,3,So why do you think your whole family is bananas?
28,7,4,When did you start going bananas?
16,1,0,You call that trauma?
21,7,1,No, you haven't slipped--it's your friends who keep walking all over you.
16,1,0,I've poured my insides out to you.
16,1,0,Viagra might help me stay up longer.
18,3,0,So she says, "No, I don't like you. You're thin-skinned and slippery." Frankly, Doc, I was hurt. You find me appealing, don't you, Doc?
19,1,1,How many lawyers did you say you are working with?
26,5,1,Why do you think people don't find you appealing ?
47,6,2,So what I hear you saying, is that you feel on a personal and professional level you're slipping.
25,5,1,Don't worry. I've concealed your identity. I called you The Orange Peel Man.
18,3,1,I think you're starting down a slippery slope.
25,5,1,What do you mean by, "profound emptiness"?
25,12,1,I can assure you that I will not fall for you!!!
19,3,0,I always said he was a slippery character!
21,5,1,I think you may be suffering from a split personality.
24,8,2,I'm tired of being the fall guy.
18,2,1,I never really wanted to be Bananas Foster.
22,9,1,Can you say more about what is inside you?
26,7,3,Actually, you ARE the butt of a lot of jokes.
34,13,4,What makes you think it was a Freudian slip?
21,4,1,My advice is you can't let the world eat your insides out.
17,2,0,My husband is driving me bananas! I have tried everything to make him happy. I have even tried to make myself more a peeling.
15,0,0,Hurry up. You're starting to fade.
32,17,4,So you lost your entire family to vegans?
31,15,4,Don't give up, someone will fall for you.
18,3,0,That's it for today. Please show yourself out.
18,1,0,His other foot could have been in Boca.
26,0,1,I feel your pain. I know Beyonce is no Carmen Miranda.
21,2,0,It appears you have commitment issues.
15,0,0,I just have this fear that I'm going to cause her to slip, you know?
18,3,0,Stepping on a banana peel isn't the same as a Freudian slip.
25,7,3,In our last session, Mr. Banana, you were confused as to whether you were appealing, or just a peeling. It looks like you resolved that issue.
23,5,2,How are you feeling about the split now?
18,3,0,When the fault is clearly not yours, you must let it slide. So to speak.
19,2,1,You've even got me baffled!
21,2,1,Banane, there was no need to strip for this session.
26,1,0,You've come out of your shell and have an antipasto phobia ?
15,1,0,I've come to say - I can't handle it anymore - I just can not watch another teacher go flying out the door!
19,2,1,Sorry, Freudian split. I meant to say feel.
16,1,0,And that's when I realised it was over between my Mother and me, I mean my lover and me...sorry - Freudian slip...
26,7,3,I think you may be unclear about the meaning of a 'Freudian slip'
35,12,7,Let's go back to the time when your parents put you in the refrigerator.
15,0,0,You gotta stop beating yourself up for the slip and fall.
23,4,2,I feel like there's something missing.
27,5,0,Now, I know that you and your ex split...
20,2,1,I am not appealing. You are!
20,3,1,Can we hurry this along, I've gotta split?
19,1,0,You are not appealing to me you are just a peel!
16,1,0,Enough with the "me, me, me", everyone slips at one time or other!
34,13,7,And in this recurring nightmare, are you always the cause of the accident?
18,1,1,I keep slipping through the main stream in society/
25,6,4,After what happened at brunch on Sunday, I don't feel that it would be ethical for me to continue as your therapist.
19,2,0,We are going to try and "appeal" to your sudden feelings of being worthless.
29,10,6,The thing is, I've always felt like a vegetable.
19,0,2,Not all bananas are destined to be top.
18,4,0,I suspect you are going bananas.
27,11,2,Maybe people are laughing "with" you.
17,2,0,Lets peel back some of your layers and discuss your parents. Did their split cause you a bunch of pain?
17,1,0,Don't blame yourself...It's not always your fault every time she slips up.
27,13,3,I mean, I just feel like the fall guy all the time.
34,13,7,And you've been involved in how many of these accidents?
25,11,1,It seems a bit late to be worrying about size.
14,1,0,Failing to be accepted for artisan salad mix doesn't have to mean you're just rabbit food.
22,7,1,Still feeling empty inside?
15,0,0,What am I looking at here?
25,7,2,Well you're no Clooney, but you do have a peel.
21,3,1,Tell me again why you find your mother so un-appealing?
30,7,5,You seem to me to have somewhat of a split personality.
24,8,3,And was it then that you went bananas?
16,1,0,No, I said we'd peel back the onion layers.
21,7,0,Have you ever lost anything that meant a lot to you?
19,2,1,When did you first start feeling that people are laughing at you?
20,1,1,And when did your sex peel begin to slip?
18,2,1,I will not accept that "it was just a Freudian slip."
20,3,0,How do you peel now?
39,20,8,So when did you start feeling you weren't one of the bunch?
29,14,3,I'm tired of being blamed for other people's slip-ups.
19,1,1,No one ever finds me appealing.
22,5,2,When did you start feeling your life was a joke?
19,3,0,Whenever I get close to someone they split
20,1,0,Look, you just need to understand that slip-ups happen and that you shouldn't be caught up in a bunch about it.
27,3,4,That’s a slippery slope.
23,11,0,This is not about my shoes.
18,3,0,So, tell me exactly when your banana split.
22,10,0,As I'm sure you know, it's a slippery slope.
26,4,1,I don't feel complete, as if something's missing.
23,6,1,What do you mean you're tired of tripping people up?
20,1,1,The first peel is the deepest.
20,2,1,Split personality? Self-diagnosis is not usually a good idea.
29,3,1,i'm sorry i ever introduced you to cheetah
26,6,3,Tell me how you're feeling about the split.
22,3,2,How did it make you feel when he peeled you?
24,8,3,Being second is also valuable.
26,16,1,Is that when you started bruising yourself?
31,4,1,Tell me more about how you feel like people walk all over you....
35,18,6,I think that underneath that tough exterior, you’re actually rather sweet.
27,3,1,So, in your mind, some part of you is still trying to appeal to your father.
25,4,3,So you feel your chimp was just using you, is that correct?
28,8,4,As a Freudian, I’m intrigued, but as a feminist, you disgust me.
33,13,5,They weren't laughing at you, they were laughing at the guy who fell.
21,4,1,Freudian slip?
15,0,0,It's good to know you are letting yourself peel again.
14,1,0,What were you expecting, a National Day of Morning?
18,4,0,I had a dream last night that I slipped on Freud.
23,10,0,Only you can say if it was really an accident.
16,1,0,I'm trying to figure out if you need to go to the rest room or rest home.
27,9,4,I'm afraid it may be too late for Viagra.
32,7,6,Tell me about the Foster home.
33,2,0,Last session you said you felt like you were going bananas with energy, and now you feel you are slipping into an internal emptiness?
30,4,1,You 'peeled away' before our session ended?!
20,5,1,Tell me when you first realized that you were´t a couch potato?
22,0,1,You have absolutely no sex appeal. And NO, I'm not falling for you. Top banana indeed.
19,4,4,So, tell me about your split.
31,6,1,So, you say no one finds you appealing? That's bananas.
21,3,0,So, you feel empty, walked on and as if everyone is laughing at you?
60,8,1,I'm just saying that describing this as mean-spirited belittling language may be a bit of an overreaction. Some people may choose, depending upon the circumstances, to see you simply as a piece of fruit, and refer to you as such.
25,8,0,Doctor, I think I'm slipping.
18,3,0,I'm just tired of being stepped on, Doc.
56,28,19,And how long have you felt like people on the street are avoiding you?
26,5,4,You say that you were abruptly separated from your siblings?
38,4,10,I'm a plantain, dammit!
22,7,1,Why do you think people step all over you?
46,6,0,My couch is not 'clothing optional'!
16,0,0,So tell me how does that make your Republic feel?
31,8,4,So what makes you think you're not appealing?
39,28,7,When you say he "fell for you,' you're speaking metaphorically, I assume?
27,8,3,I, I just feel like there's something missing. Like I'm empty inside.
26,6,3,So what makes you think every cute guy is going to just fall over you?
22,6,0,You need to get out and mingle; maybe enter a nut-loaf.
26,11,3,I see. So it was a banana in your pocket.
68,42,20,You don't need a therapist; you need a good attorney.
25,9,2,Perhaps the term 'fruit' was descriptive, not derogatory.
16,1,0,LSD? Find a shrink in Hollywood.
16,2,0,Tell me about your peeler.
20,2,1,I'm just trying to stay relevant.
25,3,1,You seem consumed by your emptiness.
18,2,1,The therapy requires more than skin.
36,16,3,You've got to rid yourself of the illusion that everyone is always falling for you.
11,3,0,Sometimes I feel myself slipping back into my old ways.
35,11,2,Tell me about the time your parents split.
28,5,1,Don't worry, you won't slip off.
18,1,1,No, Mr. Bananafuco, Viagra won't help. It's a clear case of banana ennui.
19,2,0,So your're angry about slipping on an Orange peel and can't let it go.
29,14,3,Stop calling me Chiquita!
24,5,2,I want to make sure I'm understanding...what I'm hearing you say is that you feel people are avoiding you when they walk into a room and they see you?
20,7,0,So, he slipped. We all slip.
20,6,0,Now tell me why you and your other half split?
25,7,3,Don't blame the monkey.
25,8,2,You grew up in a poor country, came here against your will in a cardboard box, and are routinely criticized for not being as good as your peers. Of course you'd want revenge.
17,1,1,Exactly when and where did you slip up?
19,4,0,Tell me; why do you feel discarded?
18,4,0,The term ‘going bananas’ seems an especially harsh self-criticism. How can we rephrase that in a way that expresses less judgment?
20,7,0,Is it possible she might just be clumsy?
25,3,3,I'm loaded with potassium, high in fibre and very popular as an up and go snack, so why am I here...? Well the truth is, I've always wanted to be a couch potato...
20,2,1,I think you'd be better off just admitting you're slippery
50,22,16,When did you first start fearing monkeys?
16,0,0,It's okay to backslide every so often.
24,8,2,I really think we are making progress in peeling back your emotional layers.
90,58,44,You may have a split personality.
23,7,1,I don't know if she slipped away because I'm empty or if I'm empty because she slipped away.
32,8,5,You're experiencing survivor's guilt.
19,2,1,And why do you say that you think you lack substance?
22,3,2,How about we get in touch with your inner fruit?
23,10,1,You blame yourself for everyone else's slip ups.
29,13,3,If you are Chiquita banana, what have you come to say?
27,12,2,It's clear we need to achieve some closure.
19,4,0,'Torn apart...empty...discarded', let's explore what might lie behind that self-image.
24,10,1,Why is it you feel everyone around you keeps getting hurt?
73,104,58,You're right; some of us bruise easier than others.
27,9,3,Tell me again why it was an accident?
25,3,3,You are experiencing a kind of penis envy...
22,3,2,And so this reckless impulse to make people slip and fall, this started after the smoothie incident?
20,1,2,So in your dream, my little Chiquita, the pedestrian steps on you and falls backward into a vat of ice cream. You shout "Cherry." This, I'm afraid, is a classic case of Banana Split Personality.
14,0,0,Counselor: "So you're saying you were attacked by banana poachers?" Banana peal: " Yeah, those merciless jackals! They take the banana and leave the peal. I can never go back to the jungle like this!"
38,17,8,I'm glad you finally decided to open up...
23,3,2,All things considered, I'd say thinking about bananas all the time is not a sexual thing in your case.
32,8,5,Being part of a bunch lost its appeal?
17,1,0,Can you remember when it was, exactly, that you started feeling this... "lack of humor?"
41,15,10,I think we can rule out a potassium deficiency.
18,3,0,I feel like something is missing from this relationship.
25,7,3,No, you do not have split personality disorder
18,4,0,First thing that comes to you when I say "Split".
20,2,1,Oh my, are you sure you're not really a plantain?
22,4,2,Another split personality issue flare up, huh?
19,4,0,Oh no, the man with the yellow hat did it again!
22,6,0,Well, I can certainly see how you would feel that way. However, I don't feel your entire life is a joke.
17,2,0,When did you first start having these feelings of rejection?
20,1,1,It's quite normal that sometimes you're just a banana.
16,1,0,A study on self-treating bananaphobia
31,26,2,I think you may have a split personality.
30,9,2,So you think your life is on the skids, do you?
49,20,3,If the clown has forgiven you, don't you think it's time to let it go?
16,1,0,I'm too lazy to pick up after my husband. He can pick up after himself.
28,12,3,Tell me more about your hostility toward monkeys.
26,3,0,How long have you felt you are a Freudian slip?
23,5,2,when did this sense of emptiness begin and how do you feel about it?
28,9,4,Lately I've just been feeling empty inside...
28,5,2,Emotionally, this is a slippery slope.
18,3,0,"It's a slippery slope".
20,2,1,Following the split-up, it's important for you not to slip into a bad place.
22,10,1,How old were you when your parents split?
25,3,2,So, how was week's experiment with oral sex?
22,10,1,So tell me, doc . . . am I bananas?
17,4,0,Together we can help you rediscover your inner strength.
18,3,0,OK, so then she said she wanted a banana split?
22,7,0,Doc, I can't take the Freudian banana jokes anymore.
62,10,0,Those Cialis commercials are wearing me out.
15,0,0,I understand your concern, but not every slip is necessarily Freudian.
16,1,0,I slipped into a comma.
19,4,0,More than has been the case with my other patients, a Freudian slip from you is understandable.
24,10,1,When did you realize you were starting to slip?
18,3,0,Now tell me about your mum.
18,3,0,Caution: Extra-slippery puns at play.
30,16,3,How did you feel when she fell for you?
16,1,0,Yes, I stood on you, but it wasn't a Freudian slip.
30,15,3,But our attempts to probe your innermost self have been fruitless.
19,3,0,So you feel others don't find you appealing?
22,8,2,Talk to me about your split.
26,7,2,When people sing "Day-o" at you, initiate your calming strategy.
14,0,0,Often, the transition from fruit to lumpin peel generates feelings of great loss.
24,6,2,Why do you think you keep attracting the wrong people?
21,3,2,I'm afraid I need to peel myself away--our time has slipped.
19,3,0,So what you seem to be saying is you have never been the same since your parents split.
30,8,5,You're not ready to start dating again. In my view, in your current state you're just an accident waiting to happen!
14,0,0,I have this recurring, uneasy dream that I've turned into a giant insect.
18,2,0,Can you describe these pratfalls in more detail?
17,2,0,There is not a banana in your pants, so are you sad to see me?
26,10,2,I'm sick of being the fall guy.
22,4,1,...and then he said I was smothering him with all my peelings
21,9,0,That's not exactly what I meant when I said we would start to peel away some layers.
18,2,0,It is true, you aren't The Fruit that everyone gets excited about.
47,36,12,Well, I'm glad you've opened up.
25,10,4,I had no choice, you were going bad!
19,0,0,I tried to help, but he called me a mirage, so I let him be.
23,10,1,People slip on all kinds of things - don't feel so guilty.
19,3,0,No, I will not slip on you !
16,1,0,You can't blame your mother because you're a fruit.
32,11,6,So you feel like an apple trapped in a banana's body?
21,6,1,It seems you need others to fall to feel good about yourself.
29,3,0,Your answer puts you on the slippery slope.
22,3,2,Yes, I think we'd all have to agree that your life has been one big stupid joke. So let's move on.
18,3,0,I think we should explore further this experience of losing yourself.
22,2,0,I feel split whenever somebody slips on me.
29,9,3,What makes you think you have a split personality?
22,4,0,I won't be able to help you until we peel back some of that thick skin of yours.
44,20,10,Perhaps we need to put you in bunch therapy
25,4,2,Looks like someone made my job easier.
16,1,0,Who slipped that peel in here?
22,7,1,I keep dreaming I'm an orange peel. Am I crazy?
34,1,1,When did you begin to experience friction?
51,44,14,We both know there's no such thing as an accident.
30,7,0,That, Mr. Cavendish, is what we psychoanalysts refer to as a Freudian slip.
16,1,0," SO TELL ME HOW YOU FELT LOSING MR. STEED?.
21,3,2,I'm glad to see you open up a little about your sex life.
18,1,1,It seems you have peeled back your surface persona. Perhaps now we can get to the real issues.
19,1,1,I thought you said you were "appeallng," not "a-peeling".
25,11,2,My diagnosis, is a "Split Personality".
25,8,2,Tell me how you feel about being eaten by a monkey?
19,3,0,Try to think of yourself as a peeling.
22,6,1,Take me back to your parents' split.
21,3,2,donkey kong ate my wife and children
17,2,0,My wife is always telling me I'm nothing but a synecdoche.
19,1,1,Even though your inner core is missing, you still have appeal.
15,0,0,Why do YOU think you others find you unappealing?
18,3,0,I'm not delusional. I AM responsible for the first Freudian Slip!
16,2,0,Tell me about your slip-and-fall.
20,2,0,With body language like that, no wonder you've been stalked.
18,3,0,You're a top banana that feels empty inside.
17,2,0,Well, yes, his new girlfriend is young, but remember, you have inner beauty.
21,7,1,So, how long have you been experiencing these peelings?
27,9,3,'Empty inside?' Elaborate.
26,10,2,She tossed me for a plantain. And they say size doesn't matter!
26,5,4,Just because your father was a plantain, it doesn't mean you're not bananas.
19,5,1,You feel like everything around you is slipping into chaos?
34,16,7,So, your father always wanted an apple?
21,4,1,No. Just leave it there or you'll give him all the power.
18,2,0,I can't. I see your appeal, but you're a patient....
15,0,0,I just wanted to let you know you are HOT!
19,2,1,I told her of course I'm happy to see you. And then she slapped me.
16,1,0,You have expressed how you love her a bunch...
18,1,0,Your transference, not mine.
23,3,0,With the loss you suffered ... it's only natural to feel inadequate.
17,4,0,So tell me, when did you first notice you had this so called slip and fall complex?
19,2,1,I find you a peeling too
22,6,1,Well, split personality is considered an outdated diagnosis.
27,7,3,So how long have you had this fear of being stepped on?
14,1,0,Why are you using such slippery words?
24,8,1,It seems you have become just a shell of your former self
24,7,1,I'd say you have a slippery personality.
22,3,2,You can't escape responsibility by calling it a Freudian slip.
29,15,3,It's like no one ever sees me.
30,6,6,Ok, let's begin. Tell me how you peel.
15,0,0,As we peel back the layers let me know how you feel.
17,2,0,Before I knew it there was chocolate syrup, whipped cream and not one, not two... but three types of ice cream." "I am diagnosing you with Post Traumatic Split Disorder. Keep journaling and we will meet next week.
16,1,0,Can you repeat that? It must have slipped my mind
29,7,0,Split. Your time is up.
18,4,0,I am a Jungian, why do you ask?
21,2,1,So you want to talk about your mood swings?
15,0,0,No, it's not my turn.
46,32,12,Now, tell me what's eating you?
19,7,1,Your problem is not unusual, it's banana envy.
22,3,2,Why do you feel you have no appeal?
22,5,1,So, she stepped on you. How do you feel about that?
18,4,0,After they ripped me apart, I felt so empty !
18,3,0,It's like every man I attract turns out to be a total monkey.
34,4,0,It was a joke, now I'm being sued for a slip and fall!
59,12,3,Sometimes I feel like a fruit; sometimes I don't.
16,0,0,You aren't bananas. Actually you are quite appealing.
19,1,1,I can't explain it, I'm just going bananas!
17,2,0,Your progress has been undermined by an oral fixation.
16,1,0,This isn't what I had in mind when I told you to have a little more skin in the game.
20,4,2,She literally tore me open and devoured my flesh. I don't know if I can go on.
18,0,0,I’d rather slip on something other than you.
23,3,2,Do you often make a Freudian slip?
19,0,1,So, you find yourself over appealing? I can see why your wife says she can't talk to you.
20,7,2,You're telling me it was a Freudian slip?
18,3,0,Let me get this straight: you’re tired of being appealing?
23,8,2,You caused a Freudian slip.
34,3,1,Since when did therapy have such a broad, a peel?
25,7,3,Ever consider a career in comedy?
38,8,10,I didn't mean to offend you, I use 'fruit' as an umbrella term.
22,6,1,You aren't going to tell me that Freudian slip joke again, are you?
27,14,2,Don't torture yourself. We all have separation anxiety.
31,6,6,Tell me why the banana split.
18,3,0,So you're blaming Ben & Jerry for the split...is that right?
21,5,1,If you want to you can be as funny as pie in the face
23,6,2,it's not your fault people keep slipping
22,1,1,You've had one too many daiquiris.
27,9,3,i know you feel empty inside since your husband split, but you still have appeal
16,1,0,Frankly, I find you less than appealing.
24,3,3,Do you often have these urges to expose yourself?
16,4,0,Well you are society's garbage. Get over it!
25,10,2,Did you consider the possibility that it's not you people are laughing at when you get stepped on?
22,3,1,It's time you channeled that emptiness...say, into a career in slapstick.
18,2,0,So tell me about this Freudian slip.
19,1,1,So tell me more about this 'first banana'...
23,11,0,Shall we explore why you're feeling "easily bruised"?
19,2,1,I just feel like I've lost myself.
12,0,0,How often do you have this dream about hungry monkeys?
19,5,0,And when did you begin feeling this sense of, well, emptiness?
26,9,1,She mentioned your appeal? Or you're a peel.
21,4,1,Peeling, splitting and bruising? Your issues have ripened since I've last seen you, where should we start?
20,0,2,First they smile and tease me about being appealing. Then the eat me!
21,5,1,So just when did you split
35,1,2,Your girlfriend is a fern?
16,2,0,Don't feel guilty about the rise in insurance premiums in slip-and-fall accidents.
33,12,5,It's good to see you opening up.
21,5,1,Let's discuss your fear of fruit-based puns. What do you find so unappealing about them? Is it just that you've heard them a bunch? Sorry, I'm going to split.
30,8,1,Obviously, you aren't as excited to see me any more.
22,9,0,And what makes you think they're not laughing with you?
18,3,0,Yes, it's true, life is short. But then, so are you.
26,6,3,And how did that make you peel?
23,5,2,I can see how that moment left you empty inside.
15,0,0,Your sarcastic tone is probably the reason people don’t find you “a peeling.”
25,8,3,Well, why do you think everyone seems to avoid you?
14,0,0,How does it make you feel being called a Latundan banana?
19,3,1,You're slipping.
21,4,1,How long have you felt empty inside?
35,7,1,Fixing your low self-esteem will be a slippery slope.
18,3,0,When did you first start feeling like a wallflower?
22,3,2,So for once, you feel that you slipped up?
25,2,2,There are other slips besides Freudian
20,3,0,In the larger context of my life it was just a little slip.
23,5,2,Let’s circle back to your comment about feeling empty inside.
28,2,0,Your problems stem from the fact that you have no a-peel .
32,11,5,So he left you for a sundae?
56,16,1,Have you ever thought that maybe other people are afraid of walking all over you?
18,3,0,You feel I slipped when peeling back your layers?
19,2,1,Mister Jones, erectile dysfunction is not uncommon at your age and I can prescribe something for it. You'll just have to pull yourself together.
21,7,1,This isn't always a fruitless exercise.
35,21,6,I'm glad that you finally opened up.
17,1,0,Well, Mr. Trump, you may have lost the election but you have certainly kept your coiffure and your dishwater pheromones.
28,12,3,And this feeling of emptiness?
32,4,6,Maybe you're just bananas
21,4,1,We've finally stripped off your peel and reached the core of your problems.
19,5,0,Why do you feel you are on the skids?
15,0,0,That sounds like a classic case of transference.
19,1,1,Tell me more about how you feel empty inside....
20,4,1,And you said you feel that people don't find you appealing?
18,2,1,I've been feeling kinda empty.
20,1,1,Was that a Freudian slip just now?
19,4,2,When did you first realize you were going bananas?
18,1,1,I was just used and dumped. And it hurts.
29,8,5,Now that I've opened up, I feel vulnerable.
21,7,0,Perhaps they're laughing with you?
14,0,0,No one take me seriously, always the fall guy...makes me feel like a heel.
16,1,0,Barry the Banana thought he was opening up to her, but his therapist decided he should split.
20,2,1,"Tell me more about this 'slippery slope'".
18,3,0,People may toss you away but always remember it's what's inside that counts.
25,7,2,And it's never your fault?
29,2,0,Tell me more about your infatuation with hammocks.
31,11,4,And when he said that, how did that make you peel?
17,3,0,They put you where?
22,3,2,I've never felt tallied.
31,6,7,So, you thought that the ice cream shop wanted you as an employee?
16,2,0,You feel nobody finds you a peeling?
17,2,0,Would you describe your relationship with your father as slippery?
21,2,1,That's very interesting, Mr. Peel. I am interested in whether you think that there was something you did to make your banana split?
21,2,1,Ok, give me the spiel...
26,7,3,So I said let's split and she laughed.
24,2,3,Could there be any way you're contributing to how all these relationships end?
19,1,1,Your wife, Orange Peel, says you won't help with the kids.
18,4,0,Well, The Banana Republic isn’t exactly welcoming if you’re a foreigner.
19,2,1,We don't use the term "split personality" any more.
46,19,3,Not your fault. He should have looked where he was walking.
48,26,15,So, you don't feel like one of the bunch?
32,8,4,I loved my mother and father, but I did feel hostility toward the rest of the bunch.
28,12,3,A split personality doesn’t mean you're nuts.
23,8,2,Well, we can all agree that you aren't completely bananas.
17,2,0,How do you feel, being an ecdysiast?
20,1,1,So tell me, how long have you felt that you're not a peeling?
19,0,0,It's a lot of pressure, you know, to be the son of the guy who caused the Freudian slip.
20,3,1,Daylight comes, sure, but the truth is you can't go home...
36,18,6,So when did you first start feeling like you're "an accident waiting to happen"?
18,3,0,I am having trouble slipping because I peel guilty...
23,1,1,And why do you think you always act like a coward?
47,6,0,I was the top banana before I slipped...could I lie on the floor I'm more comfortable there.
17,3,0,I think if we peel back your facade, we will find your authentic self.
21,4,1,No, they don't have a name yet for fear of causing others to fall.
24,9,3,Every time someone gets close to me Doc, I feel like they just slip away.
21,5,1,And she said i was to blame for her freudian slips!
26,6,0,so how do YOU feel about being stepped on all the time?
32,22,3,My life's been an accident waiting to happen.
31,6,6,Stop staring at my legs!
16,0,0,What do you suppose is the cause of your guilt feelings?
23,4,2,How does it make you feel when you can't get approval from the top banana ?
38,4,2,So you say she slipped on you and it's been downhill ever since.
21,8,0,So, tell me more about this feeling of emptiness you say you've been experiencing.
19,0,1,As your therapist, I have to tell you that you're not a-peeling.
36,4,5,My life has been on a slippery slope lately
21,6,1,I'll be charging you double because of the split personality.
16,1,0,Why do you feel you have a propensity to cause Freudian slips?
20,1,1,Next week work on crossing your left leg over your right leg.
24,2,3,Technically you have one foot on a naugahyde.
34,10,8,I witnessed my brother get peeled alive and turned into a smoothie when I was 3.
26,4,3,Tell me about this human in your pocket.
43,13,4,Doctor, I haven't been feeling comfortable in my own skin lately.
16,1,0,Not even you my therapist finds me "apeeling".
31,5,5,Who knew "going bananas" was a real thing?
17,3,0,I'd say you're at the bottom of a slippery slope.
22,8,2,So, do you think you lost your appeal after the banana split?
22,2,2,Trump's rhetoric about imports concerns me too.
31,2,0,What do you want me to tell Romney?
16,4,0,You're just experiencing common feelings of separation anxiety.
17,5,0,You'll just have to come to terms with your role as comic relief.
29,4,3,I was recommended by your friend the Orange?
22,2,2,I am glad you are able to peel back your feelings.
15,0,1,Being top banana wasn't quite what I expected
18,7,0,And what makes you think that people find you dangerous?
39,9,1,I wouldn't say the need to be slipped on is masochistic, per se, but you may be playing into society's expectations a teeny bit.
18,0,1,And it was after I lost my full ride to UVA, for tripping a kid in my ante-bellum south class for calling me "bananas," again, and he broke his nose, that I first started peeling depressed.
101,62,57,And you blame yourself for the split?
27,3,1,Our time is up, but I want to continue exploring the incident at the smoothie shop when we meet next week.
21,1,1,You're feelings of worthlessness seem to be well founded.
18,1,1,It's a slippery slope when a patient tries to appeal to his therapist.
16,0,0,You are not some placeholder for some inner banana’s feelings.
19,7,0,Really now? You think you're opening up?
19,5,0,I'd expect that kind of remark from a cucumber.
10,3,0,You've been through a horrible trauma. It's okay to feel empty inside.
17,3,0,"Peeling away the layers is difficult for me".
18,1,1,A clear case of tentacle-envy.
23,1,3,Yes, I see many cases of banana split personality disorder.
17,2,0,So, you've never been the same since she left, Mr. Miranda?
31,13,4,I’m not falling for that one again.
18,4,0,How have you been peeling lately?
16,4,0,You feel in your heart your a watermelon, is that it?
16,0,0,this is the first time I've taken dictation from an alien being so please speak slowly
30,1,1,Well then, tell them you feel like you were born an herb and you refuse to be put in the fruit section.
26,11,2,So your grandfather was in vaudeville ?
26,11,2,I really feel like she got me to open up and then she just took out my insides and threw me away.
24,2,3,Last week you were a cockroach
46,12,3,Good news and bad news: You are not delusional
41,15,9,You're just spoiled.
21,9,0,Why do you say you´ve lost your inner self?
20,6,0,It's clear you have some abandonment issues.
23,9,1,It seems like you feel empty inside.
23,5,2,You're not top banana anymore and that's got you depressed.
18,2,1,We call that a Freudian Slip, Mike.
16,2,1,So, Ms. Chiquita, have you read Kafka's Metamorphosis?
42,19,11,Are we Mr. Plantain or Mr. Banana today?
17,2,0,I hate that I always slip away from people.
18,3,0,It matters not what I think you are. Do you identify as a banana peel without the elongated edible fruit, or a lily blossom with a short stem?
18,3,0,I mean, who's to say I'm not an apple?
18,3,0,I'm having an existential crisis.
31,3,0,You need to remind them that sometimes a banana is just a banana.
16,2,0,So you don't feel very appealing now?
22,5,1,This guy you've been dating sounds like a real MONKEY!
20,3,1,To be clear...when you refer to "the slip" are we talking bedroom or sidewalk?
21,3,1,I understand you feel disconnected from your inner core.
17,1,0,Yes, I am wearing a slip!
38,21,8,The monkey nightmares are back.
19,0,0,Why can't you accept the fact that you're a very appealing banana peel?
21,7,1,Tell me more about this split.
16,1,0,Schadenfreude and Masochist What can I say, I enjoy slapstick humor and being stepped on.
28,10,2,How long have you felt like trash?
33,10,7,Mhm. Classic signs of an Edible Complex.
49,26,13,Why do you think people are avoiding you?
19,3,0,He said I'm no longer appealing.
19,5,0,Let's focus on how you're feeling on the outside.
24,5,1,Why do YOU think you keep trying to give people the slip?
17,4,0,So you think you lost your self confidence after being replaced by a zucchini?
26,12,1,So how did you FEEL when he took what he wanted, then just discarded you?
17,2,0,My girlfriend says I don't appeal to her.
30,3,0,How old were you when you first started feeling that no one takes you seriously?
29,6,5,Do you have composting thoughts?
27,13,2,You have plenty of skin in the game. You just need the guts to see it through.
19,6,0,I think it is narcissistic of you to think that everyone falls for you.
24,3,3,So tell me. When exactly did you start feeling things slipping away?
24,7,3,It's not you fault. They should look where they're stepping.
14,0,0,I just think nobody finds me appealing.
21,1,2,I think you just made a banana slip.
16,1,0,I guess I crossed the line when I told him I thought he was going bananas.
63,52,25,So you caused a Freudian slip?
22,4,1,Frankly, I don't find this session that appealing.
17,3,1,But what about MY peelings!
22,1,3,No I won't get back over there and finish my lunch, I am a real therapist, I am a real therapist
26,6,3,So you are saying you don't feel our sessions are bearing any fruit?
23,5,2,You suffer from a split personality.
18,2,1,Stop blaming yourself. It was just a Freudian slip.
19,1,0,So that is when you started to lose your grip?
21,6,0,Let's go back to the first time someone slipped on you. How did that make you feel?
21,4,1,This could be a slippery slope to your old ways.
26,12,2,I think I know why you feel impotent.
18,6,3,So you have feelings of emptiness, like something is eating at you from the inside...
21,4,1,You don't seem happy to see me.
20,4,1,Can you tell me more about the man that ate you?
20,7,0,While you do have appeal, your wife is asking, "What's on the inside?"
26,1,0,Where's the rest of the banana?
29,3,0,Let's examine the origins of your hostility toward silent comedians.
29,3,5,Now, perhaps, we can get in touch with your feminine side.
34,9,0,Yes, I understand you think those slipups were your doing, but there are wider forces in the universe you don't understand....
22,3,2,Lately I just feel like I am slipping.
34,7,2,I just feel like everybody keeps stepping on me.
26,6,3,So how did you feel after you split?
16,0,0,Tell me again, Peel, how you felt parting with your banana and watching it be eaten right in front of you as you were tossed to rot. Quickly though, you don't have much time before you decompose.
22,2,1,But surely there are some positives you can find in being 'just a slapstick trope'?
30,10,5,We all get stepped on from time to time.
16,1,0,Let's not let our time slip away again.
15,0,0,I said you are a peel. I did not say you have appeal.
23,1,0,When someone steps on me, I make them slip and fall as revenge." "Sir, I think you've gone bananas.
24,11,1,You need to quit being a fall guy.
21,5,1,Your mother was a soda jerk?
19,2,1,Being unpeeled and discarded has caused me to become a serious risk to others.
18,3,0,I just don't know, Doc. Feels like I'm going down a slippery slope.
31,10,5,Tell me more about why you think life is fruitless.
32,20,4,My initial diagnosis is separation anxiety.
17,3,0,Maybe you should see someone more Freudian.
22,2,2,So when people step all over you, you lash out and make them fall?
17,3,0,My life has been all slip-ups.
47,11,3,I just don't understand your appeal.
21,1,2,Professionally speaking, you are one banana short of a full load.
32,8,3,After we peel back the layers, sometimes what we find is underwhelming.
17,2,0,Yes, tentacle envy is a real condition.
24,11,1,Just because it's cliche doesn't mean it isn't painful.
45,27,10,Do you recall when these feelings of emptiness began?
22,0,1,It sounds like it was a classic case of a Freudian slip-and-fall.
20,3,1,It's not all about you. Some are just Freudian.
24,3,2,We need to peel back your memories so hopefully you won't slip up again.
18,3,0,So you feel like your husband is slipping away.
18,1,1,Why did your lover treat you like a pratfall?
19,1,1,You do understand you're only proverbial, right?
25,4,3,I hear that you feel cold and empty since the split.
17,4,0,I thought this was ripe crisis counseling.
23,4,2,Doc, you don't get it! People are always try to avoid me in the streets.
22,10,0,Tell me how you imagine that you would act out your foot fetish?
27,6,0,Well, this has been a fruitful session
33,12,6,And how long have you self-identified as an avocado?
21,5,0,Perhaps they were laughing with (italics) you, and not at (italics) you.
35,3,0,Someone Slipped on me Yesterday and Died!
26,13,1,Forgive and accept. People slip.
21,7,1,Hmmm... It's clear you have a split personality.
9,4,0,You no longer have appeal?
15,1,0,It's not how society sees you, but how you see yourself, Chiquito.
27,13,5,So, tell me when you first had the feeling people were avoiding you?
21,9,0,Let's talk about why you think you have a split personality.
22,6,1,In spite of your brown spots, the clowns in your past, and your innate slipperiness, you still seem to have a certain appeal.
35,13,7,Well, you're not nuts, I can tell you that much.
15,0,0,So, your loss of self-confidence was triggered by diminished firmness or fear of being peeled in public?
25,8,2,But please, tell me why you want to be an eggplant.
28,10,0,I thought I was pure banana. Then, I found out my mother was a plantain.
20,1,1,And which Freudian did you make slip?
21,5,1,Yes, most peels go through separation anxiety.
21,5,1,Just keep telling yourself "It's not my fault. It's not my fault".
30,6,6,Was it more than a Freudian Slip?
21,1,1,(When your married to David Copper field.) "Honey, can you hurry up and say "Abra-ca-dabra" because your body is sweating fruit juice on my sofa."
22,4,1,So you feel you're losing appeal...
18,4,0,You have to acknowledge why you feel so hollow inside
31,11,5,Tell me about your bunch.
53,15,17,This is why I don't schedule appointments on my lunch break.
16,1,0,Would describe your emotional state as peeled right now?
15,0,0,Let's talk about your Mother. That can be a slippery slope.
65,53,27,I think this results from an edible complex.
17,2,0,Ah, I hear you saying, you were in it just for the humor.
18,4,0,How did it make you feel when he left you for the Genetically Modified Organism?
20,5,1,You need to become more comfortable in your own skin.
23,4,2,You splay, I cross, that's why it's not gonna happen.
16,1,0,Your father's tulip shade? Your mother's favorite flower?? Your life devoured from the inside out???
30,8,5,It's just that I've never fell for a client before.
34,15,7,He just uses me for potassium.
19,2,1,A Jungian?" No wonder you don't see the problem!
27,4,4,Knock, Knock
21,5,1,I don't peel too well.
18,0,1,I'm sorry, this session is not covered by Obamacare
20,6,0,Never call yourself 'trash' when you are undeniably compostable.
34,4,3,I'm putting you on 10mg of Producezac.
15,0,0,I FIND YOUR THERAPY APPALL-ING. NO WAIT.
19,5,0,Tell me how you feel now that you are no longer top banana.
30,11,3,So how long have you been feeling all empty inside?
34,10,6,Tell me about your "foster" parents.
25,11,1,Let's talk about what's getting under your skin.
16,1,0,Sounds like a Freudian slip
21,8,0,I don't know what it is. I just have this empty feeling.
22,6,1,Subject complains of not peeling well and trouble with slipping.
34,7,3,Freudian slip jokes? You're right. Not funny.
15,0,0,So, tell me exactly what you mean, 'I feel like I'm not in my own skin.'
25,11,2,You're really beginning to open up.
17,1,0,You misunderstand. I didn't say you're appealing, I said you're a peeling.
36,8,5,Worthless piece of trash or compost?
19,1,1,I keep wondering, "Why me? Why did she need to slip on me?"
16,0,0,I SEE YOU ARE SHORT SIGHTED AND SMALL MINDED
41,16,10,I think you’ll do better in bunch therapy.
32,4,7,Please come out from under the couch, Bongo.
37,2,1,But it doesn't have to be funny . . .
18,2,0,I think we're making great progress about your physical insecurities despite the other bananas in the basket showing off.
15,0,0,Marischino cherry and whipped cream?
16,0,0,It is and it isn't what it is.
21,5,1,Peel back the layers of denial, and what're we left with?
26,8,2,And what was her reaction to you calling her a "monkey" ?
30,11,4,When did you two split?
19,7,0,Don't feel so guilty. Tell them it was just a Freudian slip.
21,6,1,Court appointed psych evaluation for a slip and fall offender
28,6,3,I have this dream that I am no longer appealing.
29,7,1,You need to stop this monkey business before it's too late.
20,0,0,So that's what you meant by "riding shotgun!"
29,8,4,Do you sometimes peel all alone?
18,4,0,So you went "bananas"…and that's when you think you lost your a peel?
16,1,0,I'm Chaquita Banana, and I was very sexy until I offered my delicious taste and nutrition to everyone.
18,2,1,So your saying you feel empty inside.
20,3,1,And, how long have you felt like a banana peel?
19,1,1,Obviously, your fruit was not comfortable in its own skin.
22,2,2,I know it's wrong, but I think I'm falling for you.
21,2,1,According to the new kitchen law, you're still produce.
16,1,0,When did you first feel you sanity slipping.
17,2,0,I'm not even a Freudian, so stop worrying about slips.
16,1,0,So, how long these feelings of being the cause of downfalls?
34,1,1,o Mr. B. tell me how you peel about your visit to the yogurt factory.
17,0,0,I will thank the nuts for the referral, but I don't think food-related, psychological stigmatism is really the issue. I think it's more like separation anxiety.
41,15,11,So you only feel fulfilled when someone steps on you?
21,7,2,Technically speaking, it's dissociative personality disorder. But in your case, we'll just go with split personality.
21,1,1,Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
33,13,6,Do not let one slip up define who you are.
18,3,0,And why exactly do you feel that you're unappealing?
29,4,4,I don't know why, but I am just feeling so empty on the inside.
15,0,0,It's a real breakthrough that you feel sorry for causing pain to others. Now we have to work on you taking responsibility for your actions instead of blaming the cartoons.
21,1,2,I ask you, am I wrong to be angry that Freud stole my punchline?
22,7,1,What I'm gathering from our conversation is that you feel empty inside.
23,4,2,I told you I was going bananas.
46,5,2,He's the one who lost appeal, not you!
24,5,1,He always said I'm nothing without him...
24,7,3,People are simply more cautious now.
17,2,0,Tell me more about these dreams you have been having about oblong objects.
28,10,3,Animal, vegetable, or mineral. My rates are all the same.
19,4,0,We've all slipped up, the key is to stop enabling others to slip up as well.
30,8,4,So, why don't you think you have appeal?
22,8,2,I'm sure that was a Freudian slip.
28,4,4,I understand you feel she was eating you alive.
17,2,0,So why did your better half split-up with you?
16,4,0,Today we're going to talk about why you think you're a joke to everyone.
16,1,0,I've been speaking to your better half - and she told me the whole thing was YOUR fault.
18,3,0,So we both have body language issues.
45,12,6,I feel like my life is just some big joke.
45,2,0,You really take that whole., 'eat at my inner feelings' thing to heart, huh?
27,9,3,Slip? No that's Freudian. I'm a Jungian.
19,2,0,I caught my wife with another banana and she told me to peel out.
21,3,1,Let's talk about your split personality.
23,1,3,When did you first feel like your life was just slipping away?
16,1,0,I find you very appealing also.
17,2,0,I know I said it's a slippery slope but I didn't mean it literally
19,5,0,Freud likened psychoanalysis to peeling an onion, not a banana.
22,5,2,It takes time to recover from any life-changing episode, and it must be so painful that your banana split.
22,3,2,"You keep saying 'slippery slope,' doctor. It's a little offensive, really.
26,14,2,Slippery is one thing, but now you're being evasive.
19,3,0,I only booed once and then I was smashed into a cleshay.
23,6,2,I disagree. Not everything's a Freudian slip.
28,12,3,Let's call them experiences rather than slip-ups.
19,3,1,Why do you think you give people the slip?
29,5,3,Maybe you should embrace the fact that you can be funny and scary at the same instant.
21,5,1,So you're depressed because your banana split, is that correct?
44,20,9,You're neurotic, NOT bananas.
23,2,2,So, how do you fell after the split?
20,3,1,I suggest that you wear an outfit less provocative to work...
15,0,0,Penis envy should (underlined or italicizes) be expected at your stage of development.
15,0,0,So, I see you've kept letting the wolves out there eat you for lunch.
23,5,2,I come from a blended family.
18,2,0,AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO AVOID YOU?
19,4,0,You are a danger to others.
17,2,0,Broad, a peel.
14,0,0,How did it make you feel when Apple said that you had, 'gone bananas'?
28,8,4,I feel like I've served my purpose in life
20,7,0,. . . so then I said "Orange you glad I didn't say banana?" and he peeled me.
30,4,3,Yeah, I get it Mr. Dole, 'spilt' personalities are 'apeeling'. Clever. Now can we talk more about what the health teacher did to you?
21,3,2,No, an onion! We're trying to peel an onion here!
15,0,0,What's eating you is up inside?
21,1,2,You know there is no such thing as an 'Accidental slip'."
28,15,3,But not everyone can be top banana.
46,21,12,You want people to like you for who you are on the outside as well as the inside.
18,7,0,Still having that nightmare where everyone watches where they’re going?
37,2,0,Seems I've raised your attention.
36,20,6,What do you mean, exactly, by uncomfortable in your own skin?
22,8,1,So tell me, why do you think everyone considers you a joke?
15,0,0,You say you Slip Sliding away
19,4,0,Well now, that was an interesting slip.
24,9,2,So tell me how the split affected your childhood.
18,3,0,You say you feel empty?
21,3,1,I give up. How DID the banana cause a Freudian slip?
24,6,2,Well yes, technically that WOULD be a Freudian slip.
20,5,1,I am going to say some words, and you just say the first fruit that comes to your mind.
33,6,4,Personally, when choosing a partner I look more for substance than a peel.
34,15,6,Sounds like you're afraid of hurting people.
28,11,3,What makes you think people are always falling for you?
24,3,3,No, your lack of tears doesn't surprise me. Most banana peels take two years to break down.
25,7,3,I'd like to suggest our Fruit Salad group therapy for you.
20,3,0,It's okay Mr. Peele, we all slip-up sometimes.
18,0,0,Okay, so you left him because you no longer find him...uh...appealing?
15,1,0,Why do you think others find you unappealing?
18,1,1,Lets peel back the layers on your split personalities today
22,2,2,And just why do you feel Donald Trump's hair is making fun of you?
19,1,0,So your angst is about sharing appeal with Donald Trump?
25,4,2,Comparing my childhood to my sister's is like apples and oranges, she said...
24,7,2,Many of us feel empty at times.
18,0,1,Listen Doc, I'm fallen apart.
15,0,0,everything has problems
21,5,1,He blames you?
33,15,6,Yes, you have told me that your banana was really big
22,3,2,How do you think I peel?
19,3,0,I'm peeling very depressed. My girlfriend wanted to split.
42,22,10,And you feel responsible for the split?
27,4,1,So tell me, when did you start feeling so empty inside.
18,3,0,It's very common--many discarded banana peels develop abandonment issues.
20,7,0,...I know, Rachael, but I assure you--you're genetically modified to NOT become your mother.
26,5,3,He hollowed me out then treated me like garbage.
23,8,1,That's all very nice, but where do you keep your wallet?
25,1,4,And how long has it been since you landed a dramatic role?
20,7,0,Lately, I feel so empty.
21,2,1,So you say you keep slip sliding away?
18,3,0,We've peeled away some of the issues that cause you to keep slipping.
18,4,0,I would never call you a 'fruit cake,' a 'banana nut' maybe.
16,3,1,I'm afraid you have split personality disorder.
25,7,2,Yes...I'd say you probably have gone bananas
22,5,1,What I hear you saying is that being the subject of lame, slap-stick humor can lead to feelings of emptiness.
26,12,1,When did you notice something was missing?
23,3,1,I just can;t deal with the guilt anymore.
17,2,0,You can't blame your wife for calling you 'slippery'."
29,10,4,I think you are ready for group sessions with the rest of the bunch.
19,3,0,And I really resent when she accuses me of slipping up.
18,3,0,Well, someone might slip on you and break their neck. So, you CAN still be relevant.
18,4,0,You're suffering from separation anxiety.
25,8,1,I agree. It's definitely hate speech to use the term "Going bananas".
31,6,0,We call that a banana slip.
26,7,3,So, you're feeling empty?
44,9,4,It doesn't matter what anyone says, you do have appeal.
20,3,1,My divorce? What can I say? She peeled off and gave me the slip.
29,8,4,So,when did you start identifying as a plantain?
17,3,0,I agree, I do think she was just using you.
17,4,0,So, you say you've been villainized in the media. Can you expound on that?
24,7,1,Can you say more about why you feel discarded?
27,8,2,Is it comedy or tragedy when someone slips on you?
17,5,1,If I understand your phobia correctly, you have a fear of monkeys?
23,6,2,I'm tired of being called the "fall guy".
20,8,0,What do you mean "jump right out of your skin"?
18,4,0,You're right, I sabotaged that relationship by trying to make him fall too hard, too fast.
28,9,3,Why has no one ever fallen for me?
31,11,4,Your ex married a plantain. How does that make you feel?
32,5,2,Let's not talk about the split; let's talk about the bruises.
31,11,4,I admit it. I slipped up.
19,5,0,Do you feel you may be losing your sex appeal?
21,6,2,We all sometimes feel like second banana.
26,7,5,It's not your fault.
16,2,0,You are not going to make any progress if you keep worrying about how people pronounce your name.
28,4,4,When they slip think of it as laughing with you and not at you.
58,17,26,I was going to be a world famous computer logo....until that damn apple showed up.
17,0,1,So, you said. "You have one foot in the grave, and the other one is a banana peel".
36,2,1,So, you feel used by the clown?
27,10,4,In psychoanalysis we take slips seriously.
41,6,2,I guess in a smoothie it doesn't count as cannibalism.
21,8,0,Explain what you mean by "slipped up."
18,0,1,I'm suffering from a guilt complex.
19,7,0,I'm sorry, I suppose food chain is an inappropriate analogy, but you didn't like slippery slope either.
25,8,2,It is called seperation anxiety.
16,1,0,I feel so old...yesterday someone called me a Bananagram.
21,5,1,I don't know... people just walk all over me and I find myself slipping into depression.
33,7,9,I've felt so empty since the split.
15,0,0,If you promise to not slip away from the bill payments, I promise not to stereotype.
17,2,0,So, try though you do, you're unable to get anyone to fall for you? Is that it?
26,6,3,And you say he stepped on you?
21,3,1,This only works if you start the conversation.
39,16,11,So, how long have you thought you were a plantain?
36,4,1,And you've grown tired of being the butt of that joke!
24,11,1,What do you think she meant by Second Banana?
55,31,17,I understand you lost nearly everything after the split.
17,0,0,Are you saying your father is Harry Bellafonte and your grandmother is Gypsy Rose Lee?
19,1,1,Why do you feel like you're at the bottom of every joke?
19,2,1,I don't know, Bob. It could be a slippery slope.
20,2,1,Stop pouting, Cheeta, and come back to the couch. We have ten minutes left.
32,11,6,Close your eyes and imagine you're on a tropical island...
22,7,1,So you have a phobia about being stepped on for laughs?
14,0,0,FREUDIAN SLIP. "I meant mucus, not musaceous. This is NOT about my family"
21,2,1,"Trust me; sometimes a banana is just a banana".
20,2,1,Number one, I need to get back to my professional code Number two, I think my boyfriend's on to us.
15,2,3,I'm willing to make an exception and charge you on a sliding scale
15,1,0,I no longer find you attractive. You are just skin to me now.
22,9,0,So you're saying that these feelings of unworthiness, of inadequacy, came just after you were named Top Banana?
35,7,7,so he left you feeling empty
26,3,4,First, we need to peel away the outer layer.
22,3,2,You're depressed because no one finds you appealing?
16,1,0,Is this your 'ego' talking, or is it just your squid 'id'?
18,4,0,Why do you think you slipped up again?
18,3,0,I meant naked in the emotional sense but this works.
17,1,0,So Tell Me,Why Are You Not Peeling Very Well ?
37,5,2,...and future sessions will be prepaid.
19,3,0,I don't think you're crazy.
17,2,1,Why don't you begin by telling me how you managed to break away from the bunch. Did you just "slip" out of sight?
26,9,1,What do you mean you life's a joke?
21,11,0,The accident wasn't your fault.
20,1,1,No, I'm not "a slip of a thing."
27,3,1,After you say you "slipped-up," then what happened.
21,4,1,Or...could the reason you feel empty inside stem back to your childhood?
29,13,3,Are you still feeling empty inside?
28,7,4,Five more minutes, and you have to split.
14,0,0,So what your telling me is that YOU... coined the phrase "The bigger they are the harder they fall"
19,3,0,Be easy on yourself. You're not the cause of people's Freudian slips.
25,4,3,It sounds like the anxiety issues actually started before you were separated from the bunch.
25,3,1,I had the weirdest dream last night that I turned into a phalluc symbol
27,8,3,Nothing personal, buy you're heading down a slippery slope.
17,1,0,The correct expression is sex appeal. And no, I wouldn't care to.
19,6,0,I need you to open up more.
16,0,0,How can I help you stay on that divan?
27,10,3,How does that make you peel—sorry, feel...feel?
18,4,0,Your going through separation anxiety since your banana split.
28,13,3,Causing harm to others may be morally indefensible, but when I picture it, it still makes me laugh.
20,1,1,Tell me why you feel like a punchline.
30,6,6,You can't just hurt everyone that walks all over you.
16,1,0,You are on a slippery slope if you are suggesting that I used you for personal pleasure.
29,12,5,Your ego is so easily bruised. You need to develop a thicker skin.
19,5,0,So, when we left off, you were talking about the emptiness you feel and how life seems to be slipping away.
20,5,1,And why do you think it's eating you up inside?
16,1,0,Don't internalize blame -- it is his own fault he slipped on you.
19,2,0,I'm sorry, but Prozac isn't approved for Starfish.
15,0,0,Potassium absolutely will not make you disappear.
18,0,1,You're slipping again.
16,0,0,Have you considered taking a break from social media?
16,1,0,You're much more appealing than I am.
37,24,6,I understand your fears, Barry, but comedy changes and so must you.
19,2,1,I can't help you - I thought you said you'd gone bananas, not that your banana's gone.
21,1,2,I think you have a conversion disorder
23,11,1,I feel like a part of me is missing.
16,1,0,So tell me again how you gave him the slip.
20,3,1,"Ice-cream sundae" confirms my diagnosis . . . Split Personality!
42,2,0,Tell me, did you always find it amusing when you felt yourself starting to slip?
20,2,1,Why do you say you feel worthless?
25,7,4,Why do you feel like a cliche?
17,4,0,When did you first become aware you had lost Chicqita?
18,1,0,Not to worry....everyone has a slip now and then in therapy.
35,11,8,Lets try focusing on the chimp.
18,4,0,I have these urges to go out and slip side away.
30,4,1,What I am hearing, is what was on the inside is no longer appealing.
19,1,1,I was kicked out of the Berries restroom and they demanded I show them my seeds.
31,12,5,Liking chocolate, vanilla , and strawberry are signs of a split personality.
19,7,0,Mine is an inclusive practice--all gender identities, fauna, and flora.
19,3,1,Have you always had a fear of sidewalks?
16,2,0,Put yourself first; let everything else fall as it may.
26,5,3,So... after he fell for you how did you feel?
18,3,0,I also didn't think the New Yorker could come up with another cartoon about psychotherapy.
21,4,1,And did you feel this way before you were peeled?
39,17,9,Seriously, you can't let people step all over you and then tell you it's your fault.
17,2,0,Doc, am I too thin-skinned in feeling that I've been stripped and discarded...?
18,0,1,I see you've gone bananas but we need to talk!
24,3,2,I feel so empty inside. This session has been fruitless.
25,6,3,And when did you feel you were slipping?
21,3,0,I didn't mean to literally make like a banana and split.
19,2,1,"You should feel much better about yourself, you have great appeal".
59,34,21,I'm afraid you suffer from an Edible Complex.
20,3,1,What makes you think I find you a peeling?
16,1,0,And how does it feel to be the instrument of everyone's jokes?
24,1,0,Aren't you going to do a split, too? Oh. This isn't yoga?
27,12,3,You say you're always "the fall guy." How does that make you feel?
16,1,0,So, how long have you felt picked on?
25,8,2,Well, we start by peeling back all the layers.
39,24,8,How long would you say you've felt empty inside?
24,9,1,I think you have a split personality.
25,7,2,Don't define yourself as accident prone; they don't have to step on you.
19,5,0,When did you first get this feeling of emptiness?
38,23,5,Hmmn...........sounds like you're playing the fall guy again
30,2,1,Sorry, I did not intend to unpeel you!
19,3,0,Tell me again why you find a peel appalling.
19,3,0,"And to think, after all of these years, it was me who was slipping".
20,1,2,You're co-dependent.
23,4,2,How does that make you feel when you're called a fruit?
15,1,0,I feel like a shell of my former self. Does that make me sound bananas?
21,4,1,So tell me how you felt the first time someone slipped on you.
16,1,0,So, she said your split left her with a bitter after taste?
29,13,3,Don't be embarassed-it's important to open up.
20,3,1,She doesn't laugh at your jokes?
24,6,2,Yes, you have no banana. No banana today.
19,2,0,'You came to this country and everyone liked you, so what made you feel like trash?'
15,0,0,No, my name is not Miss Muffet.
53,48,17,We don’t use the term “going bananas” here.
15,0,0,Very gratifying. Onions can take years of work before they will peel the layers.
34,7,1,You feel like you are just one of the bunch?
50,7,0,Did you have any issues on the tree?
27,6,4,Lying on a sidewalk may be your most rewarding career option!
21,3,1,So how did you feel when the banana split?
16,1,0,This is called "survivor's guilt". You could not have prevented that slip and fall accident.
24,3,3,It's perfectly natural to feel empty at a time like this.
18,4,0,You said opening up to me would become a slippery slope, but I had no idea.
35,3,8,I'm just a joke.
15,2,0,How do you feel about causing the first Freudian slip?
26,2,0,And why do you think I would be interested in dating a patient?
16,0,0,Note to self: Tell Macy’s they sent the wrong slip cover.
21,7,0,Actually, you're my first post-op banana.
19,2,1,I understand you're slippery but you sure aren't nuts
29,8,4,You've peeled back a lot of layers in today's session.
27,6,2,Why do you feel like your emptiness is inherently comic?
21,6,1,Tell me why you think you're not appealing?
