21,5,0,You know what they say, big umbrella, big....
23,5,1,Sorry, there's only room for me and my ego.
41,25,6,I'm in risk management.
20,1,0,I guess it's going ti rain cats and dogs today.
25,7,1,Hey, just because Shark Tank wasn't interested doesn't mean it's not a great product.
19,0,0,Do you resist spending money on advertising your business?
18,1,0,Did you bring the rainboots?
32,7,4,"They're predicting cats and dogs by this afternoon.

25,6,1,I got it used from Mary Poppins after she quit as nanny for Octomom.
21,5,0,It's a large umbrella policy.
19,3,0,I got it as a souvenir at the Republican convention 20 years ago.
32,12,3,You said to increase the coverage of our umbrella policy.
20,3,1,You would not believe how selfish I was in the past.
56,31,14,I was expecting cats and dogs.
26,9,2,Excuse me, umbrellas are really only for one person.
22,3,0,Shall We Dance?
27,4,1,It's my own weather system.
31,9,3,My financial adviser suggested increasing my coverage.
19,3,0,It's really more for meteorites.
28,3,3,It's a problem getting into a cab.
22,5,0,I used to be the umbrella dude for my car-pool!
21,3,0,Its from when I used to need a village.
30,9,2,It's really only a problem at ballgames
26,2,2,I borrowed it from Donald.

58,20,14,Wait till you see the mai tai.
30,11,3,It's got nothing to do with rain. I just like my space.
30,11,2,I think we're covered.
17,1,0,Isn't this overcompensating a bit?
23,3,1,I still can't attract more friends.
23,3,1,I firmly believe that you can't have too much protection.
29,6,3,It's from my trip to Easter Island.
33,4,3,I apologize for being too overprotective.
17,0,0,It's our new umbrella to get support from crowdsourcing.
27,7,2,Don't ask what I'm overcompensating for.
20,0,1,Hi, I'm Reinheit Priebus. I've suddenly got plenty of space.
24,6,0,Yes, it's big. But still not big enough for Trump.

26,6,2,I bought it in Texas.

20,2,1,Theres an old Chineese saying : You can never have an umbrella that is too large...
20,0,1,I'm sure no one will care! It's definitely not obnoxious to carry a golf umbrella in the city
23,3,1,I beg to differ, honey. Less is not more. Less umbrella equals more of a chance for the rain to mess up my hair.
43,4,1,I'd like to give the world a Coke.
22,2,1,From the TRUMP collection for Big Hair & inflated ego!!!
18,3,0,When my insurance agent sold me an umbrella policy, I didn't expect this.
20,2,0,No more lonely rainy days, this is a chick magnet,
35,13,3,It's great for avenues, but cross streets are going to be a problem.
23,4,1,For the last time, it's from the Trump Collection, and size is properly called Yuuuuge.
23,3,1,Ever since the lay-offs, we've had a lot more room.
26,2,3,Let's have some people over!
26,8,0,Sorry, this is only big enough for me and my ego.

19,2,0,My feet are still wet.
34,8,5,I heard Donald Trump has a small umbrella to make his hands look bigger.

25,2,1,If you think this is big, you should see my dildo.
18,2,0,When it gets really bad, I can turn it upside down and use it as a boat.
24,3,1,Just in case it gets sunny!
25,3,2,I also own the largest SUV in its class.
20,0,1,Who knew Singing In The Rain was a duet?
28,4,3,Whaddaya mean, I always overdo it.
26,4,2,I'm overcompensating because I don't smile that much.
34,13,6,No, it's not a policy but it will cover the car.

18,1,0,Why didn't you tell me to watch the puddle?
34,13,4,What do you mean I'm risk adverse ?
30,7,4,Does it look like I'm compensating?
26,6,2,I told you Ms. Poppins gained a little weight as she aged. Still, it was nice of her to remember me in her will.

32,7,4,It folds up into a Tesla.
26,5,2,I'm having a great hair day.
22,5,1,With all the stress going on in the top floors you can never be too careful
20,3,0,It's a prop from 'ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT POPPINS!!'
19,2,0,When the weather man said cover yourself for a huge rain storm, he didn't mean with a patio umbrella!
29,5,3,Would you mind holding this?
17,2,0,Yes. It costs as much as a car. What's your point?
26,7,1,I'm waiting for the flash mob.
19,3,0,I thought it was a cool idea...

22,2,1,Actually, I am sugar.
41,14,8,It was specially designed for the plain in Spain.
54,18,13,It's just a metaphor.

19,1,1,I'd like to talk to you about umbrella insurance.

22,8,1,Mary Poppins could have taken this one to Mars.
20,5,0,So.....Where do you stand on polygamy?
27,10,1,What?! It cost the same.
26,6,0,I'm in insurance. Flood and water damage. Why?

17,0,0,I usually travel with a larger contingent.
25,4,1,Yes, you too can have all your insurance under one umbrella

34,3,6,Trumpella
23,5,0,It's a large overhead but protection is guaranteed.
19,3,0,I call this my 'pre-diet umbrella'.
26,7,1,It's the global warming model. It doubles as a boat when sea levels rise too high.
20,0,1,That's the biggest stick I've ever seen. Wow, Karen.
35,8,1,But it's STILL always me that ends up getting wet.
40,16,7,In New York this would go for $3,500/mo.

66,30,19,However, I have never lost it.
70,34,23,The small was only like 20 cents less.
30,9,3,If it gets windy, we can sail home.
26,7,1,They said it was raining cats and dogs.
45,15,9,New Yorker cartoon caption contests prefer dry humor.

30,7,3,Look, this what happens when you send all your manufacturing to China.
17,0,0,Frankly, my dear, this gentle rain from heaven will also become extinct.
22,1,1,An umbrella we can grow into.
19,3,0,I didn't want you to risk getting wet and melting, dear.
19,3,0,It's organic. When it rains, it grows.
54,27,12,The saleswoman said it made me look thinner.
31,9,3,They were all out of the big ones.
19,2,0,Like most New Yorkers, I hate golf umbrellas.

33,15,3,It's also a WiFi hotspot.
21,2,0,It also distracts people from noticing the size of my hands.
25,5,1,This ought to give us some sidewalk space.
19,2,0,I was told the expanded version included tickets to Noah's Ark.
25,3,2,I call it "Godbrella"
19,2,0,If you build it, they will come.
20,2,0,See darling I told you so. Holding your own umbrella does make you feel more like the 99%.
31,9,2,This is my place. Where's yours?
38,8,7,Excuse me miss. I can't help but notice that you are also 3 inches tall.
41,12,8,We've covered a lot of ground today!

23,5,1,My name is Noah.

23,6,0,It's the one good product Trump sells.
21,3,1,Honey, now that we're empty nesters, we've got to do something about our old umbrella.

35,19,3,I can still sing in the rain, but dancing is out of the question.
23,3,1,I have a Mary Poppins death wish
27,3,3,Sorry there is only room for one
19,3,0,It also helps clear the way in a crowd.
36,9,6,It's simple really. This is my apartment.

24,6,1,My taxman says I have to reduce my overhead.
81,63,24,If the wind picks up we won't need a taxi.
14,1,0,I should have bought the big one.
23,5,1,Yes, this is our full coverage umbrella policy.
28,8,2,And it's really convenient when I'm out walking the dogs, but on a windy day.... just forget about it.
22,3,0,Its impossible on 5th Avenue
21,4,0,Betty, I don't think this is what our insurance agent meant when he said we need more umbrella coverage.
18,2,0,Cleveland delegates
15,0,0,Droplets from a cloud,...the sun's sparkling beams----we're geared up to repel all-around.

27,7,0,The coming Uber is a convertible.
25,6,1,Do you think it strikes the right note of middle aged whimsy?
22,8,1,This improved model lets me poke many, many more people in the eye.

30,12,1,And this is just my umbrella...
39,11,7,I sublet it on week ends through Airbnb.
30,11,2,I feel responsible for too many people.
29,10,2,It's fine, as long as there is no wind.
18,2,0,I have tiny hands so...
22,3,0,Forecast is calling for a big thunderstorm.
27,7,2,It's from the folks who brought us the Urban Sombrero.

21,3,0,It's useful for cocktail glasses too.
21,1,0,We don't need that umbrella........just SMILE
16,0,0,Oh didn't I tell you my surname is Snow?
25,3,2,First, our insurance agent suggested we get wider coverage on our umbrella policy. That got me thinking...
22,1,1,It used to be Marie Osmond's

19,2,0,I got it at an RNC yard sale.
23,5,1,I finally found a way to repurpose some of our patio furniture since moving to the city.

23,4,0,It's supposed to protect you from Global Warming.
21,2,1,It's a climate shield
28,4,4,Obviously, I do plan to have a family someday.
45,23,9,The salesman assured me it would be too big to fail.
52,33,11,I think I've been working in risk assessment too long.
28,11,1,It's a brand new model. They call it 'Noah's Revenge'.
36,15,4,Does it make my hands look small?

20,1,1,Wait until you see the soft drink at the movie theater.
37,16,5,What's "manspreading"?

29,11,1,And I figured, it's a really good way to meet new people.
53,24,14,It's just my dry sense of humor.
25,5,1,Into my life a LOT of rain falls.
35,14,5,You're a lot skinnier than my last girlfriend.
24,5,1,You don't know how many pollutants each raindrop has.
23,2,3,The mug was really too big
37,9,4,I wondered why my patio umbrella seemed so tiny.
43,26,7,In case of cats and dogs.
18,3,0,You're welcome to queue if the rain picks up.
24,5,1,I told you, I'm not saying you're fat!

26,7,1,All us actuaries carry these risk-reducer models.
24,7,1,I crowd funded it.
27,9,1,I guess size does matter.
35,6,6,It was in my briefcase. Why do you ask?
28,11,1,Great on a rainy day. Somewhat problematic on a rainy windy day.
33,10,4,They forecast widespread rain.
26,4,1,I'm starting to think that the salesman lied to me
26,9,1,I emptied out the rainy day account.
39,19,4,What makes you think that I am compensating for something else?
40,11,7,It covers my ego.
26,5,4,Mary Poppins can kiss my ass.
27,2,0,I had hoped my smile would protect us, but I guess it wasn't broad enough.
27,5,2,Small hands.
33,12,4,I've lost weight.
18,3,0,I negotiated a great deal on this at Donald Trump's garage sale.
29,9,2,Want to see my Mary Poppins impression?
23,3,2,I just want to be sure I'm ready if this shower is part of climate change.
19,2,0,It was on sale at Sam's!
18,0,0,Well, we need more close friends, right?
27,10,1,Yes, I have many friends. Why do you ask?
21,5,0,My insurer recommended a large umbrella policy.
21,2,0,May I interest you in our umbrella policy?
22,2,0,When I went solo, my agent said I would need a bigger umbrella.
22,12,0,It's the Uber model and we'll be picking up three passengers on the walk to the office.
32,9,4,I think my insurance guy misunderstood when I told him I wanted the largest umbrella coverage they had.
32,4,3,WOW! You do have a big one!
22,2,1,My mom was a wicked witch.
25,4,1,Does it handle well when the wind picks up?
32,2,0,I hate to rain on your parade but, as a canopy taxonomist, I am telling you, in science, no one calls an umbrella a parasol.
26,1,2,You go first, I'll catch up.
35,6,6,You know what they say about men with big umbrellas, don't you?
26,8,1,Do you suppose "Tavern on the Green" knows this is missing?
23,5,1,The weather report says there's a big storm on the way.
20,3,0,Still more practical than any of your purchases.

37,19,2,We've reached the limits of my umbrella policy.
30,11,2,Although I have to keep the brief case filled with rocks ...in case of wind gusts.
31,7,4,Upside down, it makes a pretty decent life raft if we get any flooding.
27,5,2,My insurance agent suggested I purchase an umbrella policy that would cover most anything.
30,8,5,It works great against Google maps and drones too!
31,12,0,It's really great for widespread rain.
33,14,5,I don't think it makes you look fat.
30,8,2,My shrink says we're suffering from empty nest syndrome. I think we ought to put our umbrella on the market and buy something smaller

22,1,1,Actually, it's a cone of silence.
26,4,1,Before we go to visit my mom, I want you to know that I wasn’t always that slim.
48,31,8,I was hoping for a larger turnout.
24,5,1,I only promised it wouldn't rain on you; I never said anything about a parade...
25,6,1,This must be what they meant by 'shrink-resistant'.
26,10,1,I'm allergic to both cats and dogs.

21,5,0,It's a DIY patio furniture hack.

32,7,4,I work for a crowdsourcing company.
26,2,2,Sweetheart I know you think you are over weight, but perhaps the XXL umbrella was a bit much.
34,12,4,Now that the kids are out of college, I think we should downsize.
44,14,7,You walk ahead, I'll catch up.
20,1,0,I'm a dissolver!
19,2,0,I thought this was the day I was finally going to meet your family.
25,4,2,This umbrella isn't big enough for the two of us.
21,4,0,Oh this is nothing, you should see the size of my slicker.
40,16,7," I have to stop saying "Super-size Me".
40,19,6,The forecast called for widespread rain.
28,8,2,I'm calling the concept "UBERella".
19,2,0,It's a grower.
23,5,1,You see, I know this guy named Noah...

39,20,5,They call it the Poppins 3000.

22,2,1,I ran an orphanage in a Brazilian rain forest.
30,11,3,I combined my auto and home insurance and my agent sent me this
32,11,3,RNC garage sale.
30,11,2,It was really quite reasonable. Where they get you is $400 custom-made stand.
18,1,0,It is a little heavy, but it doubles as a beach umbrella.
20,0,0,Thats a big ol umbrella hahaha
41,18,6,Sure, it keeps us dry, but it's not making it any easier to get a cab.
24,4,0,It only came in this one color.
22,3,1,Yes, I know. But the street names are blank in this cartoon, so it doesn’t matter.
76,59,19,The other ones made me look fat.
32,9,3,My insurance guy said I needed more Umbrella Coverage!"
20,4,0,Cats AND dogs?
38,11,6,It came with the drink.

24,6,0,Do I need to put my coat down for you.
21,1,1,I'm going to protect you bigly. Believe me.
23,6,0,.... and it doubles as a raft in typhoons.
30,4,4,Why, yes, I did buy it at Costco.
23,3,1,There are some things I don't like, but I don't have any phobias.
29,12,1,Would it surprise you to know that I wear a belt AND suspenders?
29,6,3,No, this is all that's left of the Republican big tent.
16,2,0,This is literally our corporate umbrella.
26,3,2,I picked this up on Kickstarter.
19,2,0,So this is what the salesman meant by comprehensive coverage.
31,5,4,This is about the size of our New York apartment.
24,3,1,What? I got free shipping!
32,10,4,Tracing my genealogy back to Noah was transformative.
15,0,0,Now we wait to see who Trump can bring into the Party.
24,1,2,My broker said I needed an umbrella fund.
19,2,0,Well it had best-in-class under-umbrella headroom.
18,1,0,Because my insurance broker said I absolutely needed a bigger umbrella to cover me.
22,4,0,For some reason, people always call me too cautious!!

20,4,1,A smile just wasn't doing it for me
24,3,1,I picked it up at an estate sale for the Wicked Witch of the West.
19,1,0,I have a small smile.
27,6,1,One thing you need to know about me... I've never been someone who likes to draw attention to himself.
86,44,34,Poppins. James Poppins.
28,8,2,I need some space.
29,11,1,It's great, until a big wind comes.
34,7,3,It'll change a man, twenty years in Risk Management.
33,12,4,They were out of large.
38,18,6,When you said "Don't rain on my parade" I assumed you had a parade.
35,8,5,My therapist thought it'd be a good way to meet people.
23,5,0,Do I look like I could work for the KGB?
40,15,8,Compensating for what?
19,5,0,The circus will never be the same without you!
32,4,5,"Cloudy with a chance of go f#@* yourself!" said Mr Trump.
19,2,0,I know....overcompensating. I can't swim.
33,14,3,You should see the size of the chocolates they left on my pillow
27,3,2,So much for a golden parachute, eh?
27,7,2,Then I asked myself, what would The Donald do?
22,5,0,In case it really does rain cats and dogs.
24,6,1,Teddy Roosevelt actually said, "Walk softly and carry a big umbrella".
43,17,8,Sure, it's great now, but the last time we had a strong wind I ended up in Cleveland.
23,3,2,Sorry babe, I know I can be overprotective.
23,3,1,What happened to the sister wives?
18,1,0,This had belonged to my great aunt Sarah Gamp.

19,2,0,It's good up to a Cat 2 Hurricane.
52,43,14,If there's a gust, I'll just meet you there.
19,2,0,But Noah said this was the least we could do.
42,15,8,Nancy was hoping a strong gust of wind would finally bring an end to an awkward first date.
22,5,0,I was always in favor of dry humor...
26,5,2,It came with my martini Venti.
38,10,7,I get a buck apiece at the bus stop.
27,6,2,Be careful! There's a puddle up ahead!
22,5,0,Well, dear, you can't say you married a risk taker.
21,1,1,Under my umbrella
22,2,1,It's an invention I call a Dumbrella. You'll see why as soon as there's the slightest breeze.
22,2,1,Haircut? What haircut?
20,2,1,Go back there and tell them you'll take the golden parachute!
40,9,8,It's not going to rain on my parade.
24,6,1,Given what might happen to us in the future, I thought it would be a good investment.
18,0,0,a lot of penguins died to make this umbrella, but nothing is to good for you.
21,2,1,Did I tell you I served in the Airborne Division?

19,0,1,I identify as Mary Poppins.
31,10,3,The new diet is really working.
25,3,1,How big do you think I am?
17,0,0,I had to take umbrella insurance into my own hands.
26,5,2,Well--I couldn't afford a golden parachute.
24,4,1,This isn't just any big umbrella, this is the El Niño 700!
24,5,1,They say it's not size that matters, but I've always been an over-compensator anyway
31,7,3,We'll just wait here till that puddle dries. '
18,1,0,Directions say, Don't open in windy conditions.
19,2,0,But, it protects us from the Acid Rain.

24,5,2,Yeah, it's the platinum plan, the bronze one fit in my drink
35,10,5,It's one of the few perks that comes with managing an umbrella fund.
25,5,0,I couldn't afford my insurance premium, so my Travelers Insurance Agent gave me this umbrella.
41,21,6,I figured, why not? We rarely use the patio anyway.
23,5,0,It comes with a carrying pouch and its own zip code.
20,3,0,Splash away – it won't make me feel too foolish.
25,4,1,Step on a crack and you break your mother's back!
30,10,2,We must look for an SUV cab

23,5,1,I super-sized it at Brooks Brothers.
27,10,1,If this catches on, we'll need bigger sidewalks.
28,11,1,''I work for a certain insurance company, It's mandatory.''

72,29,26,This is the Republican solution for climate change.
42,27,5,This umbrella is specially made for widely scattered showers.
28,4,3,I received it from PBS. I suspect I needn't tell you that it was a sizable donation.
24,5,0,I feel like the Rihanna of middle-aged insurance salesmen.
21,1,0,Well, I heard there was a big rain coming.
23,6,0,My hands are full, dear; sorry...
20,4,0,After the deluge, a flotation device.
20,4,1,...... a guy named Noah handed it to me and said, "Take this......... you'll need it."
35,15,7,now that you've finally lost all that weight, can we please get a new umbrella
29,4,4,Sting was wrong.
18,1,0,A reliable source told me this is "some other day."

28,8,2,Why yes! It does cover everything.
31,12,2,See, our umbrella insurance policy covers you no matter what.
25,4,2,My advisor keeps telling me to increase our umbrella coverage. Just this month we went from parasol to patio.
32,5,5,It looked smaller in the package.
25,5,1,It sure comes in handy but, the mini storage bill is a bitch.
36,12,5,It's all this Purple Rain talk... it has me terrified.

21,3,0,My wife got this for me she said I have a big head
23,7,0,You know, I hate to admit this, but sometimes being an eternal pessimist has its upside
18,0,0,The campaign is focused on inclusion, especially of wet minorities.
28,8,2,The best part is that it fits into my briefcase.
32,9,5,See all those pigeons?

29,6,3,I heard “El Nino” was coming, so I got Mexico to pay for this. The biggest, hugest…”
31,4,3,I also where suspenders and a belt.
27,2,2,I didn't want you to melt.

24,3,1,I've got a really big smile!
18,1,0,No bad luck with this one.
29,9,2,I wanted to buy an umbrella policy for my very large family.
18,0,1,I've stopped using it in the snow since the avalanche and dog tragedy.
32,9,4,My insurance agent suggested That I increase my umbrella coverage.
22,2,1,I think the rain has growth hormones too.
32,7,5,I got it from the old Republican Party.
72,63,21,It's less about staying dry and more about annoying other people.
22,2,1,And you said the additional umbrella coverage was a waste of money.
18,1,0,Well, just a bit, maybe.
34,8,6,Yes, I was on the Biggest Loser. Why do you ask?
29,14,2,I invited a few friends to join us.
28,7,2,Yes, but it's also a beach umbrella that folds to fit in my briefcase.
20,3,0,The Agency felt this would be there best use of my undercover skills.
16,1,0,This is our umbrella insurance policy.
49,26,10,The forecast calls for widespread showers.
23,3,1,It's for a CIA mission...deep undercover.
26,7,1,It's a golf thing, you wouldn't understand.
29,6,3,I've never tried folding it.
23,4,1,I finally have a reason to tell people why my left arm is so muscular that doesn't shed light on my frequent masturbating.
26,12,0,My therapist mentioned something about a 'Noah Complex'. What do you suppose that means?
36,16,7,You should see my umbrella stand.
22,7,0,Sorry, there's just enough room for me and my ego.
32,12,3,I bought it at the big umbrella sale.
26,6,3,I want my ego to stay dry.
28,8,2,Why? Because who would steal it?
26,6,3,Yeah, nothing is big enough for you
26,4,2,I've always thought you were a Republican...
27,5,3,That was my biggest drink ever.
25,5,2,I used to be very close to Chris Christie.
39,9,7,This is bigger than both of us.
18,1,0,Global warming is true, but that umbrella is a bit much.
24,5,1,I saved up for a raining day.
46,25,12,Here, let me overprotect you.

22,2,1,Don't you have a Donald Trump joke for this one?
19,2,0,Hey Eleanor this looks like us when it rains
39,24,6,I saved for a rainy day.
18,2,1,My mother wanted to be sure.
18,1,0,I'd prefer if you walked three steps behind me.
24,4,1,Must have packed my wives' umbrella by mistake.
24,7,0,No, I don't work in insurance. Why would you think that?
32,11,3,It's a metaphor.
18,1,1,The new guy doesn't believe in a big tent. Big umbrella is as far as he'll go.
28,2,3,It's called the 'Trumprella.'
19,3,0,There were a lot of good deals at Tiger Woods' garage sale.
18,4,0,It takes a village
70,25,23,Of course it's 'over the top' . . . where else would I put it?
27,9,1,I answered an ad: "Free upgrade for your hand-held portable device".
19,2,0,Your crowding my space and my dryness.
22,5,0,I bought it at the Ten Gallon Hat & Umbrella store.
19,2,0,It's never rude when you're UNDER it.

21,4,0,I'm thinking our patio table may be getting wet.
22,1,0,Sweetie, being made of sugar sure makes this umbrella a life saver.
16,0,0,This was a business venture. I thought I'd rent it out for private parties.
22,2,1,You agreed to three kids so I prepared.
23,1,1,I hate little umbrellas !
27,5,1,Why yes, I am for universal health coverage.
23,3,1,Is this big enough for you?
25,7,1,'Meteor shower tonight'
17,0,0,it was only a couple hundred dollars.
22,2,1,You know what they say about people who have large umbrellas . . .
25,9,2,I picked it up at a Texas Costco.

37,15,5,We're lucky you ordered the Mai Tai
33,10,4,I'm staying at the Trump Plaza and they provide huuuuuge umbrellas.
47,26,8,They were predicting widely-scattered showers.
22,2,1,It was a gift from my bartender after an embarrassing weekend of ... well, I'd rather not say.
24,4,1,Just imagine the size of my insurance coverage.
20,3,0,I am big. It's the umbrellas that got small.
18,0,1,Big hands, big umbrella.
22,2,1,Let me guess-you think it's yuge?
30,19,1,Overcompensating? What are you suggesting?

21,4,0,Careful honey -- that's just outside of our insurance's umbrella policy.
20,3,0,Uber will be delivering the food and chairs soon, let's enjoy the view and smells in the meantime.
22,9,0,Global warming means heavier rain, right?
29,6,3,What do you mean by over-compensating?
30,6,3,I'm expecting a flash mob.
24,8,0,I 'm going to the beach later...
24,5,1,It's the smallest model that qualifies for Uber Umbrella.
22,2,1,Did I really knock over six people when I opened this?
25,9,0,If the wind starts to blow I will have to give you a very quick good by kiss.
18,1,0,It works particularly well when the violets start to fall.
20,0,1,I'm a Democrat.
17,0,0,It's about time they stopped the Ringling Bros. Circus use of elephants.
50,18,13,If it weren't raining, I'd feel like an idiot carrying this thing.
19,1,0,Why don't we find a bigger umbrella?
42,22,8,This one should be a bit harder to lose.

39,8,1,I'm an English man,living in New York
19,2,0,Mobile office space is the new thing, I got a pretty good deal on this one.
