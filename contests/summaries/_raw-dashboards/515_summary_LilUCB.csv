4,0,0,Welp. . . time for another insurance claim.
4,1,0,The D stands for Dummy.
4,1,0,Let's give it one more try and then we can go looking for the platform.

4,0,0,That movie seemed so realistic
5,0,0,It's the last one on our bucket list!
6,0,0,Ok, it was a bad idea to let the railroad arrange our rehab, but that doesn't make me crazy!
4,0,0,So, Mr. Train, Please describe your fear of metro's.
4,0,0,Can you scratch my left shoulder?
5,3,0,Sounds like your inner critic again.
3,1,0,Sticking my thumb out doesn't seem to be working either.
5,0,0,It's always best to face your fears head-on.
4,1,0,Same time next week, Mr. Karenina?
4,0,0,This might be a little late, but does our insurance policy have an expected or intended injury exclusion?
4,0,0,Our new nurses better be single
5,2,1,Well, you know what they say, "Third time's the charm".
4,0,0,You promise that getting in front of this train will pay off even bigger than the car thing, right?
6,3,1,Wasn't I fortunate to find a shrink with a similar Death Wish?!
4,0,0,Ever read 'Anna Karenina'?
6,1,1,I can't help but feel sooner or later our luck is going to run out.
5,2,0,Trust me. It'll stop this time.
4,1,0,This is the last time we use Airbnb.

4,0,0,I hate reruns.
5,2,0,Break time!
4,0,0,Your "sure-fire free ride" idea isn't going to pan out.
4,0,0,Hopefully this is less painful than D plane!
4,0,0,As my therapist, do you think my dreams are a tad too realistic?
4,0,0,Just stay clear of the third rail, you'll be fine.
4,0,0,I know I've said it before, but "Good-bye, Lenny."
4,1,0,The listing said that it was very close to public transportation.
4,1,0,That long recovery time they talked about doesn't sound so bad right now!
4,0,0,OK, so maybe it is too close for comfort.
4,0,0,Next time we gotta bring the outdoor furniture.
4,0,0,Let's delve deeper into your dreams involving trains

4,1,0,It's the 3rd rail that'll kill ya.
5,3,0,Let's move past the trust issues.
4,0,0,It's not a great job, but somebody's gotta do it.
4,0,0,As crash dummies go, I think we went above and beyond the call of duty.
6,0,1,We can't continue these sessions if you refuse to discuss your fear of trains.
4,1,0,By my reckoning, we've got about five minutes to get through rehab before the next one comes by.
4,0,0,This is much nicer than our last place
4,1,0,I''ll take my chances with the jury.
4,0,0,The things we go through for a little Oxycontin.
3,0,0,I am grateful for a union that is always there to give us a break and not leave us behind.
4,0,0,Do you think this will hurt?
4,1,0,This is great live t.v. I love it. We should come here more often.
5,3,0,They say three's the charm.
5,1,0,Next stop: Tell me about your mother.
4,0,0,I'm beginning to think this isn't the best spot to keep taking our rest break.
6,2,0,Fatal a-track-tion...
5,1,0,I don't know, doc. It just feels like I'm on track for disaster.
6,0,1,I miss the days when we used to catch ambulances.
4,1,0,First a wheel, then the caboose.
4,0,0,Think ya used enough dynamite there, Butch?
4,0,0,We can't afford to go anywhere this year, so we are taking this railroad holiday.
4,0,0,Don't worry - this time we're gonna D-rail that guy.
4,0,0,My lawyer should be on the 10:37.
4,0,0,They told us free healthcare would be a trainwreck.
4,0,0,Sure, break testing can be fatal, but how about that incredible retirement package!
3,0,0,Is this what you call my 'repetition compulsion'?
4,0,0,Broke down area waiting for repairs!
4,0,0,I've always been attracted to the wrong side of the tracks
4,0,0,Whatever happened to cabooses?
6,1,1,You know, I'm not totally sold on this online therapy.
4,0,0,The first attempt didn't help my suicidal tendencies, but I respect your diligence.
4,1,0,Next time we go to the HIGH line!
4,0,0,Next time let's not ask for the Club Car.
4,1,0,Boy this brings back fond memories.
4,0,0,Healthcare sure is confusing.
3,0,0,Don't worry the D Train is never on time.
4,0,0,So we're making our way down from the "A" Train, Duke?
5,2,0,-There you go, I just lost my train of thought.
4,1,0,The one time we come prepared to wait for the train...
4,0,0,This way, your fear of my methods will eclipse your fear of the D train.
5,3,1,We're gonna have to move soon.
4,0,0,Is this hallucination as bad as the 2 line to the Bronx?
6,2,1,Don't Move !
4,0,0,I just remembered ... the D Train doesn't stop here anymore.
4,0,0,I make a motion that we quickly close this session of the Broken-Appendage-Barcolounger-Trainspotting Club. Can I get a second . . . ?
5,3,0,I distinctly remember you telling me to stay on track.
5,0,0,If the the insurance company doesn't pay this time,it'll be my last time!
5,0,0,Your life is literally going to go off the rails .
4,1,0,Get ready...make it look like an accident.
4,0,0,How many times do I need to tell you? Just don't touch the third rail and you'll be fine!
4,0,0,Didn't the doc say tracktion?
4,1,0,Finally—these delays are killing me.
4,0,0,Maybe this time we should just touch the third rail.
4,0,0,As long as we're not on that dangerous third rail, we should be fine.
4,0,0,They call it trainspotting, up close and personal.
4,0,0,Now this better get us into 'Hamilton.'
4,0,0,Don't worry, it's about to tip over.
4,0,0,This time stay put!
4,0,0,This one smells like stale ketchup.
4,1,0,Now remember, Sean ... 'no pain, no gain'
4,1,0,Maybe this time, our Social Security Disability claims will be 'Approved.'
7,4,3,I'm having second thoughts about this train phobia therapy.
4,1,0,Oh no, not another express!
5,3,1,I didn't realize how painful it would be to confront my fears head-on.
4,0,0,I like him too, but just because Bob Dylan sang Slow Train Coming doesn't mean it's always going to be true.
4,0,0,Roger, when are we going to stop fighting that imminent domain law suite?
5,2,0,Trust me. I've had excellent results with this kind of trauma re-enactment therapy.
6,1,1,We ought to think about homesteading somewhere else.
4,1,0,What seems to be the trouble?
6,2,1,Honestly, I didn't think living in the subway would be this hard.
4,0,0,So much for getting our lives back on track.
5,2,0,This might be a case of rapid transference.
4,1,0,I've decided to work on my bacterial flora.
4,1,0,Now if my calculations are correct the backing up of this train should reverse our injuries that we suffered yesterday.
4,0,0,I think we should have paid more attention to the "Medicare D" clause
4,0,0,We're sure lucky, we missed that Third Rail !
3,1,0,Sometimes, a train is just a train.
6,1,1,I'm beginning to feel as if living on the edge IS our comfort zone
3,0,0,Well, they now say the threat of death is the greatest recuperating factor.
4,0,0,The real cause of rising healthcare costs
4,1,0,Forget the sidelines, we're sitting on the line.
5,2,0,How much do you think we'll get in the wrongful death lawsuit?
4,0,0,Our transportation has arrived......
6,0,0,I guess it wasn't our time.
4,1,0,I believe some dreams should be repressed.
4,0,0,I guess the party side tracked us, eh Bernie?
4,0,0,Biff, this is the best sanitarium our health care can afford.
5,1,0,So, you have seen Double Indemnity.
8,0,0,It's not the most glamorous job, but somebody's gotta do it.
6,1,3,Do you ever get the feeling your life is just one giant metaphor?
4,0,0,I told you, even if we are on the right track, we will get run over !
4,0,0,Love this proactive stance
5,3,1,People complain therapy lasts a lifetime, but with my method we're done in just a few sessions.
5,2,0,Yes, doc said our recovery is on 'D,' right track.
6,1,1,As Freud might have said, Seymour, sometimes a train plunging through a tunnel is just a train plunging through a tunnel.
5,2,0,Watch that third rail!
4,0,0,So after that base jump incident, she asks me, "If Ernie sat on the tracks would I?
5,1,0,They say you need to get back on track for a full recovery.
4,0,0,Well then, what is YOUR definition of crazy?
5,2,0,We should probably get goin'.
4,1,0,I know you are trying to cure me from my phobia of trains, but this just isn't working.
4,0,0,Next vacation we're spending more than $2.75 each
4,0,0,Time's up. Let me check my timetable for next week.
6,1,2,Are you sure that's the way exposure therapy is supposed to work?
4,0,0,I told you the locals don't go here anymore.
4,0,0,Yes, it’s difficult, but exposure therapy can cure your subway phobia only if you stick with it.
5,4,0,We've really got to get better at reading these train schedules, Don.
4,0,0,You said we would end up owning the railroad
4,0,0,I thought alternate side parking regulations were suspended today.
6,0,1,Are you having that dream again right now?
4,0,0,So you see, soderodromophobia isn't just a type of paranoia.
5,2,0,Cheaper than moving to Oregon...
4,1,0,Still, it's less crowded than the Highline.
3,0,0,It is a boo-boo choo-choo.
4,1,0,Thank heavens we're Canadian. That would have taken six months in the States
4,0,0,I'm getting a bit bored with this Close Call® Time Travel, Jim. After the asteroid impact and that drowning islands scenario isn't this one kind of anticlimactic?
5,0,0,The Doctor told us how lucky we were ...
4,1,0,Don't worry, it's the D train. We still have an eternity.
3,0,0,Fine but if we don't make it on this time lets just go ahead and pay the fare like everyone else.
6,1,1,Let's go, Uber just came
6,0,1,It doesn't look like they are going to go around us this time either!
4,1,0,I knew your travel Web site would somehow end up costing us an arm and a leg.
4,0,0,I guess living on the other side of the tracks isn't any better
4,0,0,After surviving what we've survived, OF COURSE we're indestructible!
5,3,0,I have these crazy thoughts, Doctor--even right now, I feel like we're tied up under Penn Station.
4,1,0,Isn't this a little extreme doc...couldn't we just move from America to get away from Trump?
5,2,0,... and not only that, it makes really weird tan lines.
4,1,0,We're safe until someone adds the wheels
4,1,0,You just HAD to try the little red button, huh? Feel better?
4,0,0,I can connect the dots from A to C but not to D.
4,0,0,Okay I'm convinced, you are not just paranoid.
4,0,0,Nothing like being prepared for the worst.
7,1,3,Ah! the 3:42! This will be our last session!.
4,0,0,It's as if I was on the subway tracks with a train coming right at me. So, how does that make you feel? Don't worry doc, it'll all be over soon.
4,0,0,Next time, mind the gap.
6,0,1,It's supposed to encourage quicker mobility...
6,0,1,5th time's the charm.
5,2,0,Perhaps we’re using an old timetable.
6,0,0,It's the same dream doc, it's Opening Day and the Yanks will win the Series if they don't get hit with injuries.
4,1,0,Tell me what the "D" stands for again.
6,2,1,How many times a week do you have this dream?
4,0,0,Here we go again.
4,0,0,I think we would be happier if we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
4,1,0,D service was rerouted due to trauma on the tracks.
6,2,2,Sure, living here has its drawbacks, but you've got to love the raised ceilings.
4,0,0,Whose bright idea was this?
4,0,0,I wouldn't call it an existential threat...
4,0,0,This will surely get our minds on track
4,0,0,Our health insurance does not cover ambulance service to take us out of here!
4,0,0,How far to the handicapped ramp?
4,1,0,This is what we should have tried to begin with.
4,0,0,Just seize the moment! Short lives matter.
2,0,0,The Grim Reaper always rides the D train - it's an express.
4,0,0,These one-side wheeled trains from New Zealand just don't run anymore.
4,0,0,I am confident our pre-bandaging techniques will finally make us rich.
5,1,0,The F train hits with sharp, steely chutzpah, but I prefer the mellow crunchiness of the D.
4,0,0,Call this a track to recovery? I need better insurance plan.
9,5,7,I think that’s all the time we have for today.
6,0,1,You know, it's not that we're all obsolete so much as that we are all the victims of deferred maintenance.
4,1,0,All things considered, though, you can't beat the $800 a month rent.
6,4,2,You're not insane if you're not expecting a different result.
4,1,0,Are you sure were covered for this?
6,2,1,Mass transit is the way to go!
4,0,0,My hearing's coming back...finally!!
4,1,0,Look! If we dive forward, we're saved! No wheels of the left side!
4,0,0,No wonder my insurance doesn't cover this therapist.
6,1,1,On a scale of 0 to 10, how content are you with your life?
4,0,0,Not enough punch. I give it a D-.
6,2,1,This should get us over the deductible.
4,1,0,Well, look on the bright side. The train didn't come off unscathed.
4,0,0,See, I told you, NYC's subway is safer than the DC metro.
4,0,0,Do you suppose our fascination with Madam Caboose here is anything like the feelings Ahab had for Moby Dick?
6,2,1,Looks like this is the end of the line.
4,1,0,Providing we eschew rats and the third rail, the place is quite commodious.
4,0,0,Last time we did this the train went the wrong way
4,0,0,Are you sure the D Line stops here?
4,5,1,The good news is, you're about to meet your deductible.
5,3,0,This "occupy" thing has gotten way off track.
4,0,0,These protests are taking their toll...
4,0,0,It's okay, I have insurance.
4,3,1,You were right. The chaise was better over there.
4,0,0,They put us on the wrong side of the tracks again.
4,0,0,They say this upholstery will stand up to anything.
5,0,0,The light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train.
5,0,0,Ah, I’ve always wanted to try indoor trainspotting.
4,0,0,Are you feeling run down?
4,0,0,Its the last train to Clarksville
5,2,0,The ad said great light and easy commute.
5,2,0,Man vs. Train: The Final Episode
5,3,0,Not nearly as innovative as your last business, "Third Rail Cupcakes".
4,1,0,I'm starting to understand why the rent is so good.
7,0,2,Yes, I do have violent dreams.
5,0,0,Front row - third baseline at the subway series. Are you kidding, what could be better?
4,5,0,At least this time we can say we saw it coming.
4,0,0,This particular painting best represents his blank canvas phase.
4,2,0,You see, Mr. Smith, I meant it when I said I'd rid you of your fear of the D train even if it's the last thing I do.
4,0,0,I told you that if you took the wheels off the subway it would fall on us...
4,0,0,It turned out that our insurance claim is invalid unless we get a statement from the driver.
4,1,0,Looks like the train is going dangerously fast again.
4,1,0,finally, an end to our suffering.
4,1,0,You gotta cigarette?
5,2,0,If I was able, I'd have on clean underwear.
5,1,0,I didn't know it was that kind of crash course.
5,3,0,Do you ever feel like you are an accident waiting to happen?
4,0,0,I'm having a few doubts about our staycation.
6,1,2,The final meeting of the Death Wish Club is now called to order
4,0,0,If they ever approve a budget, this may become a problem.
4,0,0,And we thought there'd be nothing to worry about once we got on to the tenure track.
6,2,2,The one time it's on time.
8,3,5,So this is the part of the dream where you wake up?
4,0,0,Wow, this is the best 3D movie the I have ever seen
4,0,0,This train will never leave the station.
4,1,0,(Sound of train screeching to a halt) "Previously on Subway Post-Op..."
4,1,0,We should've waited for the express.
4,1,0,As Dorothy Parker said, 'The Bronx, no thonx.'
4,0,0,Taking this Nietzsche thing too far this time don't you think?
5,2,0,Trust me - with insurance scams it's third time's the charm.
4,1,0,You would think it had learned by now
4,1,0,Looks like we're out of time again.
4,0,0,I told you it wasn't a local.
4,0,0,move the engine back a bit Fred,you can see it in the frame!!!
3,0,0,We should'a taken the A Train.
6,1,1,It's probably a bad time to tell you that I lost the video of us jumping.
6,0,1,I feel like I've been run over by a train.
2,0,0,This time the settlement should be six figures!
4,0,0,You're transferring again!
4,0,0,Uber is sending the biggest thing they have.
4,0,0,I don't care how low the rent is, the medical bills are eating us alive.
5,4,0,Are you sure we've met our deductible?
4,0,0,still better than flying.
4,1,0,You should see what happened with Dave and the 4 train last week. Damn near paid off his house.
6,3,1,I told you. The look on the enginer's face makes it all worthwhile!
5,0,0,I think this only worked in "Inception."
5,4,0,Tell me again Doc. How is this going to cure my fear of trains?
4,0,0,What does "a hair of the dog that bit you" mean anyway?
6,2,1,I think we're about to make another connection.
5,3,0,Feelings of anxiety are expected during exposure therapy.
4,0,0,Mmm, I'm feeling a little run down too.
4,0,0,Yeah, I asked for my insurance claim to be fast-tracked, too.
6,0,1,Quite frankly, it is the noise that bothers me the most.
4,0,0,o.k. now, this time its foolproof. I guarantee we'll get a good lawsuit out of this.
4,0,0,deja vu... ikr
6,2,1,Well, Jim, the nightmare's almost over.
6,1,0,Just once more-we can cure you of this irrational fear of trains.
4,0,0,Let's hope the self-driving feature works better this time.
4,0,0,Look, training is SUPPOSED to be hard.
5,0,0,I refuse to go back on Dr. Phil's just to have him tell me that I don't see things through.
8,1,0,I'm seriously beginning to doubt this whole 'no pain, no gain' philosophy.
4,0,0,Be careful not to touch the third rail.
6,0,0,This really brings me back to our hitchhiking days....
6,0,1,If at first you don't succeed try again.
4,0,0,We'll be okay as long as we don't touch the third rail.
4,0,0,I'm telling you, Frank! The voice on the phone said "Trump Protesters' Meeting, ten o'clock sharp."
5,5,1,But the most hurtful part was being accused of lacking judgment.
4,0,0,I think that we are doing couch surfing incorrectly.
4,1,0,Sure the furniture is nice, but still I'm a little uncomfortable.
4,0,0,The modern day version of an old classic.
4,0,0,we must find a new meeting area
4,1,0,Third time will be the charm.
3,0,0,If you hum that tune one more time I think we can figure this out.
4,1,0,That ride cost us some arms and some legs.
6,0,1,I hate accident recreation.
4,1,0,We'll be at the ER in 15 minutes or less, I betcha!

4,0,0,So how long until you can get back on the bike?
5,3,0,But besides this, how are you?
5,1,0,Well, they did say that the lounge was at the back of the train.

4,0,0,I think our last gig was too risky
5,0,0,We have to stop meeting like this.
4,1,0,What makes you think we've been railroaded?
4,0,0,At least the primaries are over. The general election shouldn't be as bad.
5,0,0,They never talk about the dangers of "staycations."

4,0,0,they don't call it the "track lounge" for nothing
6,0,1,Uh oh. If the "B" train stood for broken bones...
6,2,1,I feel your rat anxiety has subsided.
4,1,0,I know that I was wrong about the freeway, but we should be safe here.
6,0,1,I live on the other side of the tracks
4,0,0,Talk about being ignored!
4,0,0,I think that lawyer sent us to the wrong track.
4,0,0,I know it's tough. But it's the best way to treat your train-phobia!
6,1,0,Looks like the New Yorker is insensitive to the innocent lives lost in the subway to terrorism in Brussels.
7,0,0,1. Watch out for the third rail. 2. This commute is killing me.
4,0,0,Thanks Obama.
4,0,0,Sometimes you just need to kick back, relax, and let the D come to you.

5,3,0,When is something interesting gonna happen?
7,5,2,I hope this is the end of the line.

4,0,0,Remember the phrase, "first come, first serve?"
4,0,0,Obamacare works!
4,0,0,It's the only place in the city where I feel completely safe.
4,1,0,So you really think your life is a train wreck?

5,0,0,Instant cast removal coming up!
4,1,0,Sorry, my last session ran a little over.
6,0,1,And here I thought we were finally on the right track...
4,2,0,You say 'it felt like being hit by a train' too often.
5,1,0,I just think we make the same mistakes over and over again.
4,0,0,Next time, don't forget the TRAINING wheels!
6,1,2,And how will this make you feel?
5,2,0,Fourth time's a charm.
5,0,0,Who knew the Bronx was up and the Battery down

4,0,0,Big Apple ingenuity--not owning a car doesn't mean you can't play Chicken.
4,0,0,Affordable Housing
4,0,0,Well, I'm glad that's over!
5,2,0,I think we need a better personal injury lawyer for these insurance scams.
4,0,0,So once again, I think it's time to stop.
4,0,0,When Trump is presidente he'll make it all beautiful and great again!

4,0,0,"Relax.. It can't happen again till the express comes by.
4,0,0,Oh nothing, I thought you said something.
4,0,0,This should cure your fear of trains. Or kill us.
4,1,0,Once we meet the deductible it won't be so bad
5,0,0,The train says "D"! Don't worry bro. It means "Don't move".
4,0,0,Who knew that staying of track is so dangerous.
5,0,0,they must really think that D will me on time if there are no sick passengers onboard.
4,0,0,Hang-on! Wouldn't this be a total "tunnel-vision" on things?!?
4,0,0,Kinda sad how they sidetrack their broken-down equipment and working stiffs.
4,1,0,This time appears to be more than just an error in judgment.
4,0,0,Whatever happened to 'if you see something, say something'?

5,4,1,Now, where were we?
4,0,0,I know we botched the first attempt but this should put the naysayers to shame!
4,1,0,Of course I support him, he knows what this country was found on - only the strong survive.

4,0,0,I've always been accident-prone. I can't explain it
4,0,0,Dang it, Slim. This posse rocks!
5,0,0,So Superman vs. Batman has come down to this?
6,2,0,Maybe we should just meet at a coffee shop, like everyone else?
4,0,0,It's right on time!
4,0,0,sometimes i feel like the D is always coming at me
4,0,0,agreed, the last track did have impact, but let's skip this one!
4,1,0,Doc, the price of convenience for our session's location costs an arm and a leg.
4,0,0,That may stand for deja vu--and what's gonna happen this time to us.
4,0,0,Tis only a flesh wound!
4,3,0,They warned me not to see a shrink below 81st.
4,0,0,He knows us now.
4,0,0,Are you sure that this is the best way to overcome my fear of the D train?
5,2,0,Are you sure this is what the therapist meant when he said: "Get back on track."
4,0,0,Hun, are you sure this is the High Line?
6,0,1,Oh busses are a piece of cake.
4,1,0,These walk in clinics are popping up everywhere.
6,1,1,It’s normal for a patient to resist termination.
5,2,0,Now you know why the D train never runs on time.
4,0,0,It's my job as your therapist to help you address all your fears.
5,2,0,If it doesn't kill you...it'll make you stronger.
4,1,0,I'm sure glad the doctor told us to relax and not train so much.
4,0,0,Some people just have bad luck, is that what you said?
6,0,1,So much for 'third-time-lucky'.
4,1,0,If at first you don't su--
3,0,0,What a painful vacation.
4,0,0,You're sure he said our recovery needs to get back on 'tracks'--with an 's'?
3,0,0,No, I don't think you're on the right track yet.
4,0,0,Now would be a good time for a breakthrough.
4,0,0,I sure hope collision avoidance works better this time.
5,2,0,It looks like our hour is up.
4,1,0,...aaaand here we go again...
4,1,0,I know you think I'm crazy, but I have this déjà vu sensation again...
5,0,0,See? I told you. If we had taken the LIRR we still won't be home by now, and we'd be outdoors in the snow. That's how it could "get any worse."
4,0,0,Double Jeopardy starts...now!
5,2,0,Are you sure pre-existing conditions are covered?
4,1,0,2nd time is a charm
4,0,0,"Easy come,easy go".
4,0,0,Is this where Trump, going to rail us ????with the D????
5,2,0,Knowing what kind of a temper Cheney has, you still had to mention the missing wheels.
4,0,0,I don’t think this is reducing my fear of tunnels.
4,1,0,Best seats in the house, trust me.
4,0,0,You're my shrink, you should appreciate an unnatural fear of the D train.
4,0,0,I see you took the early retirement package for crash test dummies as well
4,0,0,From now on we're playing it safe. No more selfies!
4,1,0,I don't think we are on track to fully recover.
4,0,0,What do you suppose will happen if we touch that third rail?
5,4,0,Are you sure we couldn't just work through this with toy trains and a little imagination?
3,0,0,I think the train is a metaphor for your divorce, Sam. Or, you're just scared to get hit by another train.
4,0,0,I'm beginning to think this is not what is meant by "train-spotting"
4,0,0,Wonder what that "D" stands for?
4,0,0,I feel like our country is on the wrong track.
5,2,0,This might be my last psychology experiment.
4,1,0,Watch your foot -- you're near the third rail.
4,3,0,Oh look my four o'clock is early again.
4,1,0,I'm telling you for the last time, no more double dares!
5,2,0,This probably isn't covered either.
4,1,0,Sometimes a dream is NOT just a dream.
6,0,0,Maybe next week we can confront your fear of The Vagina.
5,3,0,Are you sure this trains going to stop this time?
4,1,0,They give me Medicare on line
2,1,0,I think I got my lines wrong.
6,1,2,Now we'll see if 'train' is as reliable a signifier as 'cliff.'
4,1,0,Stranger Under A Train
4,0,0,I don't know why people think we're so accident prone.
5,5,1,Let's hold that thought for next week.
5,2,0,Yes, nightmare recreation therapy always works. Why do you ask?
4,1,0,Once again, I feel as though we are on the wrong track
4,0,0,How much time do we have, this time? " "It's worse than the Presidency this year, but better than our health insurance.
5,0,0,If it doesn't work this time, next week we'll proclaim Sanders at a Trump rally.
4,0,0,Look! A train!
4,0,0,Relax, another one will be along soon.
4,1,0,Sometimes I just feel like we're at the end of the line
5,0,0,beep beep, move over roadrunner.
4,1,0,I think it's time we had another break.
4,0,0,Bad Karma!
3,1,0,I prefer the express.
5,4,0,Here it comes again!
5,2,0,Sometimes immersion therapy can be a tad intense.
4,1,0,yeah... under my new PPO this is the best room I can get
5,0,0,I told you, the policy says there's no deductible with the 'D' train.
4,1,0,Ya' can't beat the rent!
4,0,0,This time they won't be able to cover their tracks.
5,3,0,One more round of desensitization should do it.
4,0,0,I'm out out of here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,0,0,Finally! Trump's health care plan.
6,1,1,The Airbnb listing did say 'close to transportation.'
4,0,0,And you said that rail is a thing of the past...
5,1,0,Yes, sometimes transference can be very painful.
3,1,0,This never gets old.
4,0,0,I laugh in the face of D...
4,0,0,We're getting our money's worth before our health insurance runs out
4,0,0,A quick trip from here to eternity.
4,0,0,This time it will be different. This is the D train express.
4,1,0,File it under the, "Lightning don't strike twice rule." We're good.
4,0,0,Before Obama Care Dr. D had a nicer office
4,0,0,We'll show them March Madness.
6,0,1,What we really need is a platform bed.
4,0,0,How do you think we got here? I don't know! You went to it he same party I went to.
5,0,0,I still can't figure out what I did wrong.
4,0,0,when we last met, we were discussing Danny from work and certain... emasculating... comments he'd made about... your wife's... corn hole
7,1,2,Do you hear something?
4,0,0,I think we have taken this adventure tourism idea too far....
5,4,0,We're an accident that's gotta happen!
5,1,0,Look! We just gotta get a room.
6,0,0,What? The drain's humming?
8,1,1,Don't worry, this will get you closer to your mother.
5,1,0,And we're going to keep coming back until you have some closure.
4,1,0,Relax, we're taking the 'A' train.
5,3,1,Now you're on the right track for a big breakthrough.
4,1,0,I'm glad we signed up for the Dr. Kevorkian plan.
4,1,0,"D" as in "Deja vu".
6,0,0,I think we are making progress. I'll see you next week.
4,0,0,Thanks Obamacare.
4,0,0,Get ready for the mother of all repetitive motion injuries.
4,1,0,Maybe we'll catch a break.
4,0,0,Hey, WATCH IT! I'm laying here.
4,0,0,In retrospect, maybe we shouldn't have faced our fears head on . . .
5,4,0,Well yes, your dreams certainly are realistic
4,1,0,Well, I guess we won't make the sale at Ikea.
4,0,0,So, how's your lawsuit going?
4,1,0,See, train watching isn't safer than bungee jumping.
5,3,0,How would you describe your divorce in less vivid terms?
4,0,0,...a hair better than blackjack, Frank. 50/50.
4,0,0,Funnily enough Jung postulated a possible link between Deja Vu and dissociative identity disorder
6,0,1,Remember the good old days when we used to ride this train high on cocaine.
5,2,0,This one track conversation is going nowhere quickly!
6,0,1,You can never admit you're wrong, can you?
5,3,2,After this, we transfer to the B at West 4th.
3,0,0,Regardless of the circumstances it's Obama's fault.
4,0,0,Fool us twice....
6,1,2,Your happy place is quite evocative, Richard.
4,0,0,Feels like deja vu all over again.
4,1,0,Have you overcome your fear of train tracks yet?
5,2,0,I think we're on the right track now.
5,0,0,Are you absolutely sure this ain't the last train to Clarksville?
4,0,0,We shouldn't have signed up for the discount health insurance plan.
4,0,0,Do you think one of the train's conductors will recognize us from last week?
4,2,0,Perhaps we should try a different approach
4,0,0,Ralph, why do you always get me in these situations?
4,0,0,"The good thing is there's no third rail".
4,0,0,I was warned the upper west side would cost me an arm and a leg
4,0,0,I told you leading from behind was a much better idea.
4,0,0,A coffee table might be nice.
5,4,0,That must have been painful for you.
5,2,0,I'm feeling good vibrations here.
5,2,0,I'll remind you that I HAD a nice office until your last aversion therapy session!
4,0,0,So you said that you were a therapist in "train-ing"?
4,0,0,Are you sure about this? I thought it was suppose to be a railroad bed not a couch.
5,4,0,Look, aversion therapy is not meant to be easy.
4,0,0,I don't care how much it costs - next time we're riding on the inside.
4,0,0,I think life was better on the wrong side of the tracks.
3,0,0,Did you ever think we really stink at this suicide pack thing?
4,0,0,I think we're doing this 'riding the rails' thing wrong.
4,0,0,The view is worse.
4,0,0,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Yeah, that's a bit of a stretch.
4,0,0,Something about therapy with you makes my life seem like a train wreck.
3,1,0,It only hurts when they pass.
6,3,1,I had no idea this is what the ad meant by a railroad flat.
7,5,3,Just how much stronger do you think it'll make us this time?
4,0,0,No lost time accidents with this railroad.
4,0,0,Absolutely nothing can spoil my afternoon nap!
4,0,0,As your therapist, I have a legal obligation to be here.
4,1,0,Next time we occupy Wall Street, I vote we work the main level.
4,0,0,I'm not paying you for this session
6,0,1,Don't use your pain as a crutch
6,2,0,Let's try one more time to revisit your subway-phobia.
4,0,0,We like to die in comfort
4,1,0,We're covered, as long as this is a local.
4,0,0,The real estate agent told me we moved to the right side of the tracks this time...
4,1,0,Don't worry, if you don't survive I won't bill.
5,3,1,So, Dr. Siegfried, how much aversion therapy before I conquer my subway fear?
4,0,0,What I'm trying to figure out is why we have to pose for this "investigation" picture. The perils of homelessness have no bounds.
6,2,2,Siderodromophobia is a tough nut to crack, Mr. Jenkins.
4,1,0,I don't think this therapy is working on my fear of trains.
6,1,1,Maybe we should have started with your abstract problems.
4,1,0,Can't afford to move. We're broke.
6,3,1,I keep on having this recurring dream...
4,1,0,Well, as Einstein said, 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.'
5,4,0,Why do you think that these sessions make you anxious?
4,0,0,I just can't catch a break here.
5,0,0,Didn't I tell you this wasn't such a good idea?
4,0,0,Can you read the top line?
6,3,1,The claims adjuster asked if our accident could be reenacted.
4,0,0,Third rail's a charm!
5,0,0,I think he has interesting ideas but I doubt he will be elected.
4,0,0,I forgot the chips again.
4,1,0,Is this the train waiting for the wrecks that have already happened?
6,0,1,SAY "LITERALLY" AGAIN.
5,0,0,We will keep at it until you get over your fear of being run over by a train.
6,0,1,They'll stop? That's what you said last time!
4,0,0,Let's hope we are so lucky this time!
4,1,0,Just stay away from the third rail. That's really dangerous.
6,0,1,We are here to pay our respects to Johnie, his last words were watch out for D train.
4,0,0,You're right doctor. This is helping me overcome my fear of death.
4,0,0,Is the "D" train going to make "us" great again?
5,0,0,It's a local, and I have a local anesthetic.
5,3,1,Maybe this immersive psychiatry thing wasn't such a good idea after all.
4,0,0,For the last time, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
6,1,1,Don't you find the sound of air brakes comforting?
4,1,0,Did you leave a note for the therapist?
6,2,2,Time's up.
6,0,0,"Relax, the "Mobile Hospital' is just as good".
4,0,0,I regret nothing!
5,2,0,How's your arm?
4,0,0,I think we're poised for another breakthrough.
5,4,1,Alright, last one, you have one second to live, what do you do?
4,1,0,I mean, what are the chances?
5,0,0,Next reunion's on the #2 line!
4,1,0,This will be a quickie.
4,0,0,You're right. Train Squatting was a silly idea
6,1,1,I want to thank you for sticking with me through this office move.
4,0,0,Yeah, D is for disabled, but we'll be back on track in afew weeks.
4,1,0,This should resolve your trust issues once and for all.
4,0,0,Has The New Yorker come around to dick jokes?
4,1,0,This isn't bad...you should see how workman's comp works in my country.
6,2,0,You're positive Guinness has a record for this?!
4,0,0,I had a tough life but passing those turnstiles was way over the top.
4,0,0,My last shrink complained that I keep reliving the accident.
5,2,1,BOB MANKOFF
6,0,1,Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
4,1,0,This form of euthanasia takes a lot longer than I thought!
6,0,1,This is the second case of crash test dummy delusion that I've seen today!
5,3,1,You're repeating the same mistake.
6,1,2,I like the exposed brick
3,1,0,This is the only thing that alleviates my depression.
4,1,0,I always feel worse going to Brooklyn than arriving from it.
6,1,1,And another thing--I'm voting for Trump!
4,0,0,You and your outside dineing request.
4,1,0,See you on the other side, Frank.
4,1,0,Don't worry. I've got malpractice insurance up the ying yang.
4,0,0,This exposure therapy is really dangerous.
4,0,0,huh, what? You sure now how to pick to noisiest places to spend time at
4,1,0,These local trains are going to be the death of me.
6,2,1,Whenever you think it can't get much worse, there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
4,0,0,I told you we should have read the fine print before signing up for Obamacare!
4,0,0,He was asking for it, marshall. Cheats play with weighted marbles.
4,0,0,Did you notice there are no wheels on the far side of the coach?
6,4,2,Looks like we're out of time.
4,0,0,Chillin on the Railroad!
4,0,0,Well, Tom, I think we agree there is no better way to destroy a train of thought."
4,0,0,Tea will be served at 4 o'clock on the upper deck .
6,1,1,After that last fiasco, I never thought that we'd get back on track.
4,0,0,Me? YOU'RE the one who told the doc you felt derailed.
4,1,0,You're always getting off on the wrong track!
3,0,0,Featherbeding can be crippling.
4,1,0,I thought you said—
4,0,0,So, how do you like my new mantransit cave?
6,0,1,My lawyer is in the caboose.
4,0,0,Republican health care!
4,0,0,This session is over at 4:17pm.
4,1,0,I prefer the sex dreams.
4,0,0,I've been living on the other side of the tracks too long.
4,0,0,I am sure train therapy is killing me!
4,1,0,The only people who care about us are geeks who read the New Yorker Magazine jokes.
4,1,0,Our ongoing investigation of Zeno's Paradox may be about to reach its--
3,1,0,I think it's time you approach your therapy with a little more urgency.
6,2,1,I'm afraid we've run over again.
6,2,1,Just one more good insurance settlement and I'll be all set for retirement.
4,0,0,So glad we got off the D train, Harry. Who, exactly, told you to add spontaneity to our marriage?!
4,0,0,Double Indemnity Cast Party
4,0,0,I swear, those Obamacare deductibles will be the death of us!
4,0,0,I never realized how dangerous streaming could be.
5,2,0,Putting "learning to be fearless" on our bucket lists was not a very good idea.
4,2,0,This train almost never backs up. In fact, I've only seen it do that once.
4,0,0,This time I'm betting on Zeno's paradox.
4,1,0,I like to imagine that it could have been worse.
6,1,1,I feel like you're avoiding the larger issues here.
6,1,1,Well, the doctor recommended traction.
4,0,0,Then after refusing to pay, my insurer said they'd fast track my appeal.
4,0,0,If we miss the D, the B is eight minutes out.
5,3,1,It pains me to say it, but this is the end of D line.
6,0,1,Watch that third rail. You could get hurt.
5,0,0,You ever get the feeling you've been cheated?
6,1,2,Let's pick up where we left off last time, shall we?
4,0,0,Our jaywalking binge got boring, maybe this will be more of a thrill
4,0,0,Relax! This one leaves for Georgia around midnight.
5,2,0,Remember: don't touch the third rail.
4,0,0,Through this whole Batman v Superman argument, what have we gained?
4,1,0,For our next session I'd prefer going back to the Niagara Falls barrel.
4,1,0,Don't worry Quantum Mechanics says we are here.
5,2,0,And how does my new office make you feel?
5,2,0,I told you not to sign that timeshare contract.
5,2,0,Trust me, I'm a doctor.
4,0,0,You thought Obamacare was bad? Well welcome to Trumpcare!
4,1,0,Shouldn't we have set up over there?
4,0,0,The Broken Boneyard
6,1,1,I thought that was the end of it.
4,0,0,Push.
5,0,0,Has it never dawned on you that maybe we're both crazy?
7,0,2,Sorry Doc, I lost my train of thought...wait no, there it is
4,1,0,Okay honey, third time's a charm.
5,1,0,I understand - It looks a lot worse than it appears, but you are on track for a speedy recovery.
4,0,0,This is the only traction covered by my insurance too...

6,0,1,I think we represent the other candidates in this tortured metaphor of the Republican primaries.
4,0,0,I'm afraid that's all we have time for today...the "D" will be back in service before our session ends. Let's pick-up next week at the bottom of the Brooklyn Bridge. --Thanks, Doc. I sure appreciate the sliding scale.
4,0,0,This is ok but I'm not going to Brussels!
4,0,0,I think we were better off "off the rails".

4,1,0,Did you call the trial lawyers?
6,0,0,hold your breath now, pumpkin, the train will remove the cast quicker than you can say Jack Robinson
6,1,1,So when you said you have an irrational fear of subways B, L and T you were talking about a sandwich?

4,0,0,Now that we are comfortable, tell me about your dog.
5,2,0,Do you think we're taking this insurance scam too far?

5,0,0,I feel your pain, Charlie.

4,0,0,This isn't working.

4,0,0,Sit back. Relax. La Donald will come to you!
5,3,1,Well, I'd say we have a 50/50 chance.
5,1,0,I hear you saying the train is coming. Can we unpack that?
4,0,0,It's hard to die.
5,2,0,Next time, lets fly!
8,3,2,After this, we should get complete disability.
5,3,1,I'm afraid this will be our last session, Mr. Smith.
4,3,0,Call me an optimist.
5,0,0,We might want to reconsider the detriments of catastrophic thinking.
6,1,1,So how is your peripheral vision coming along?
4,0,0,When we're at work, we train with no breaks.
4,0,0,It an arm and a leg from Brooklyn to the Bronx!

4,0,0,Prepare to make the jump to lightspeed!
5,1,0,"Getting through the alphabet is going to be tougher than we thought".
4,0,0,It's only my 3rd acupunkture session but it feels revolutionary.
4,0,0,I think we need to the the R recovery line !
4,1,0,I thought you said the 'A' Train was going to finish us off!
4,0,0,I think it's time our therapy changed track.
4,0,0,Parallel universes merging? Never thought about it. Why?
7,2,1,Nothing is inevitable.
4,0,0,How about we get a cabin this time?
4,0,0,Are you sure ObamaCare will cover this?
4,0,0,Wait! I THINK I remembered the air brakes this time.....
4,1,0,Let's continue to explore this sense of impending doom you have.
4,0,0,I understand the metaphor, but next time, maybe we stay on the RIGHT side of the tracks?
7,0,0,Then you heard screaming. So how did that make you feel?
4,0,0,Always reppin'.

4,1,0,I spy with my little eye...
7,0,0,Oh Magoo, how come this roller coaster isn't moving?
5,2,0,You up for some ping pong?
5,0,0,Yesiree, we're the lucky ones. You should see where my cousin, Bob, the bridge painter, is recouping after HIS worker's comp accident, on the Verrazano.
4,1,0,Maybe next time you won't use your cellphone in the quiet car.
4,1,0,Maybe I should try skydiving.
4,1,0,The good news is, after years of therapy, I think we are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel!
6,1,1,There's a reason the rent is cheap here.
6,3,2,And that's a wrap
4,0,0,I think I bought the wrong tickets to "Crash Test Dummies."
5,1,0,And you were worried about the third rail
3,0,0,Worth it. Just love trains.
4,0,0,I'm not thrilled with your timing.
4,0,0,'D-Train was my nickname in college.'
4,1,0,What kind of screw-up is this???
6,1,0,They ran us over once and I thought that would be the end of it.
6,2,1,It's time we finished, my 3:10 is here.
4,0,0,It's the perfect plan - what could possibly go wrong?
5,2,0,So now that Scalia's gone, how's the Supreme Court gonna rule in Idiots vs MTA?

4,0,0,As usual, we're right on track.
4,0,0,We're past third time lucky. What now?

4,0,0,So much for our banjo strumming days!
5,3,0,Our doctor-patient relationship is on the wrong track.
4,0,0,Again we are on the right track now for a disaster.
4,0,0,Do you think the train knew where it was going?
4,1,0,That train of thought won't help you out.
4,0,0,This time, by God, they will let us on the train!
4,0,0,I'm seriously thinking of taking your therapy on a different track.
5,3,1,D Train! I win again!
5,0,0,Does hitchhiking work as well on the tracks as it does on the road ???

5,3,1,Looks like our time's up for the week, Jerry.
4,0,0,And how did you feel toward the train when it hit you?

4,0,0,Whose idea was it to rob FAO Schwarz?
5,0,0,Did I hear someone say, "All Aboard!"?
4,0,0,All I said was that neither of us would vote for Trump.
4,1,0,Do you think the D stands for detrimental?
3,0,0,It figures. The one time the D train is on schedule.
4,0,0,First, waterboarding. Now this.
4,0,0,I told you there's no Superman!
4,0,0,I think we need to analyze why I'm the first victim being hit in your speeding train dream
7,1,1,What are the odds it will happen again in exactly the same place?
6,0,2,It’s obviously moot at this point, but in therapy we must learn that there is a very important difference between an aphorism and a metaphor.
4,0,0,I think we finally have your therapy on the right track.
4,0,0,How many entrances does the afterlife have again?
4,1,0,Is it me, or has it been a while since I laughed at a New Yorker cartoon?

5,2,0,I find the vibrations extremely relaxing.
4,0,0,I never liked commuting anyway.
7,1,1,We really should be getting back
5,2,0,We'll continue next week.
5,1,0,Good news, Sam. The C train took care of our annual deductible.
4,0,0,Why did they get rid of the caboose
6,1,1,Which way do you think it's going?
4,0,0,Why does it matter Donald, they already blew up the Train?
4,0,0,Don't you think we've had enough training already?

4,0,0,I warned you about putting the TV in a high-traffic area.
4,1,0,I told you it wasn't safe to steal those wheels.
5,4,0,So the other day, my boss threw me under the bus.
4,0,0,This is not a caption, it is a comment: I am sorry, but being French, and after what happened in Brussels yesterday, nothing can be funny about that. PLEASE REMOVE this week's drawing contest.
4,0,0,Look Sid, This is the 'D' train, you've had the chaise-lounge for 'A', 'B' and 'C' already. I get it for 'E' through 'H'. Beyond that, the good Lord willing, we can discuss who gets what chair for the remainder.
4,0,0,Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten us into.
4,0,0,Now hold that train of thought.
4,1,0,''I feel like things are finally moving in the right direction.''
4,0,0,Is it comming or going
4,0,0,Don't worry, we're covered for pre-existence injury.
4,0,0,I think it went, "Take the A-Train."
3,1,0,We're testing the dummies on board.
5,2,0,Just waiting for the Malbec Train.
6,1,1,Can't we find another way to get me in touch with my feelings?
4,0,0,Johnny? What does deja vu mean again?

5,0,1,Again? C'mon, what're the odds?
4,1,0,You said there'd be wheels.
6,0,1,Could be worse.
5,0,0,What was I saying? I lost my train of thought.
4,0,0,I think we're just accident prone.
5,3,1,Now in this dream, you say you always wake up before the train hits?
4,1,0,Trust me. This is the way to cure your fear of subways.
3,0,0,Where did we leave off last session?
5,2,0,Wrong side of the tracks again!
7,0,0,At least the co-pay got us this far.
4,0,0,Just worry about the third rail, okay?
4,0,0,So if i'm hearing you right, you feel like your life is a train wreck.
4,0,0,Do you get the feeling we live on the wrong side of the tracks?

4,0,0,You are really certain that it is going the other way!!?
4,1,0,Can you believe this weather we're having?
4,1,0,Does 'lightening doesn't strike the same place twice' apply to us?
4,1,0,I told you we should take the A train.
5,0,0,Lenny, go ahead and wake me up when you hear it coming
3,0,0,Don't worry, if you don't make it this time I won't bill you.
6,1,0,I’d say belly-boarding trains have seen their heyday.

4,1,0,Hair of the dog, Smythe. Do I have to explain everything?
4,1,0,Relax; it's only an Escher drawing.
4,0,0,I think we seriously misjudged your disability scam!
4,0,0,My agent assured me this is our new health provider office.
10,0,0,Jezz, those wheels look less painful.
6,0,0,That’s the last time I’m going to fight those jam-packed crowds on the 5:06 out of Grand Central.
4,0,0,Are you sure we have the right train THIS time? Yeah, you're gonna love spring break in a Miami hospital dude!
5,3,0,Waiting for a late train is like adding insult to injury.
5,2,0,Bob, our relationship is really going off the rails.
4,0,0,We worked through the base jumping and rock climbing phobias. I think i can live with the train thing.

5,2,0,This is nothing. You should've seen my last VA hospital.

4,0,0,We'll be fine this time with the chairs.
4,0,0,The third rail of therapy is fear of the known.
4,0,0,In my nightmares, they put the other wheels on and we really get creamed...

6,1,1,Eminent domain? Nonsense, this will always be our home.
5,2,0,At least it's quieter than my last apartment.
4,1,0,And in your dream, what happened to us after you saw this on-coming train?
4,0,0,He said that the D will take us to Coney Island
4,1,0,Never thought we'd derail like this
5,2,0,whoa.
4,1,0,This will help me get rid of my itchy cast. What's your excuse?
4,0,0,I think we're on the right track.
6,1,1,I thought you said this was going to be the A Train...
6,0,1,Sue for a million? That train just left.
4,0,0,I will bet you another $1 that it won't back up.
4,1,0,Relax, we've already met our deductible.
4,0,0,Trust me, this time it'll work.
4,0,0,When ya gonna get your license back?
6,1,0,Have you considered a visit to your happy place?
6,0,0,Perhaps next time we should try the High Line.
6,0,1,Chair men of the bored.
5,4,0,It's not the office visit, it's the commute that's killing me.
4,0,0,What else do we have to lose?
4,0,0,I told you he'd come back to apologize.
4,0,0,Oh, it's just D train.
4,0,0,And what do you think is the cause of this fear?
4,1,0,I'm sensing a breakthrough.
4,1,0,That sign says D train. You told me we were here for the Punch Line.
4,0,0,It's not piracy if it's 'Tracks of My Tears,' pronounced like 'chairs...'
3,1,0,You call this progress?
6,1,1,What pre-existing conditions?
4,1,0,You're right. It's right on time this morning.
4,0,0,So, in your dream, you say the light at the end of the tunnel turned out to be what?
4,1,0,Who said there's no affordable housing.
4,0,0,Schedule said it was a local.
5,2,0,I can't look to the left, is that train coming or going?
6,0,1,As far back as I can remember, my mom would always say "Tommy, you just never learn, do you?"
7,0,0,When we get there, I'll take you to Nathan's.
5,4,0,I feel your pain.
6,1,2,Quick question, remember how we got here?
6,0,1,I hope the light at the end of the tunnel is on my left
6,0,0,Aah...it's good to be a Teamster.
5,3,0,Doc said I'm right on track.
4,0,0,Do you think maybe the realtor was recommending tract housing?
4,0,0,All the hospitals were out of network. And you?
4,1,0,I wonder what's keeping Superman?
4,1,0,I think its time we should move.
5,2,0,I have a new appreciation for riding the rails.
4,0,0,We call it method psychiatry.
5,0,0,Déjà vu. I remember now, it means...
4,1,0,If you miss the "A" train You'll find you've missed the quickest way to Harlem.
7,0,1,Can we please just fake a slip in a supermarket next time?
5,0,0,Be very careful not to touch the third rail.
4,0,0,My, is the 2 o'clock early again?
4,0,0,Rehab's Rehab. Besides, it's covered, minus the co-pay.
4,1,0,Second time lucky.
4,1,0,Doc, this is the perfect location to talk about my past!
5,3,0,I really think we're on the verge of a breakthrough.
5,3,0,I think one more session and your fear of the subways will be gone.
4,0,0,My wife says train spotting isn't a real man's hobby. I'm here to tel.....
4,1,0,I'm thinking sky diving next.
4,0,0,This is going to cost an arm and a leg" "Maybe two
4,0,0,I'm having a hard time adjusting to these ultra-modern physical therapy protocols.
4,1,0,We should have given that Red Cap a tip.
4,0,0,Yeah, the most fun part of Munchausen's.
4,1,0,But people always said we had tunnel vision.
4,0,0,Oh no, not the D train again!
6,6,3,Wait for it. Wait for it...
6,1,1,I keep telling you, my methods are unorthodox.
5,4,0,I vote we abandon this whole bucket list concept.
4,0,0,I told you it was the 'quiet ride' car!
4,1,0,I really hate reenacting my dreams.
4,0,0,Brace yourself??? Not funny, Sid.
5,3,0,I usually take the A train.
4,1,0,'I'm pretty sure we're on the right side of the tracks now.'
4,1,0,Learning to face your fears sounds so good on paper.
4,1,0,If this train left the station 20 minutes ago, how long will it take the ambulance to meet us at the next one?
4,5,0,I'm afraid this may be our last session.
4,0,0,Next year I say we upgrade our room to the station platform.
5,2,0,This is not a healthy addiction.
4,1,0,You know what? A low deductible is not the be-all and end-all of insurance.
4,0,0,I don't think is what they had in mind when they said "Sit back and relax!"
5,2,0,That's nice, but we're here for catharsis, not deja vu.
6,0,1,Trainspotting becomes as a contact sport.
6,0,1,I thought you said the D didn't run on Easter.
4,0,0,Don't tell me you forgot to change the signal to red.
5,0,0,It's getting late but can you raise your good arm higher?
4,0,0,I don't think that this is our stop.
4,0,0,We have to stop playing chicken with this train
6,0,1,I told you we shouldn't have mentioned that we're Republicans.
4,1,0,That was unexpected. Have you seen the movie Ghost?
4,0,0,Our Godot will be tomorrow's Hamilton.
4,1,0,In spite of the occasional intrusions, it's a decent place.
4,0,0,This lounge set really is comfortable.
4,0,0,Tomorrow I am definitely lowering my deductible.
7,1,1,How many rounds is a game of chicken supposed to last?
4,0,0,You only think you hate me, actually you are experiencing "trainference".
4,0,0,This is gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you.
6,0,1,Surely there's got to be an easier way to proof the kid's algebra homework, Terry?
4,0,0,Say what you will but the GOP replacement for Obamacare costs less and cuts down on red tape and wait times!
5,0,0,The A train is quicker.
4,5,0,Ten bucks says it goes forward this time.
4,1,0,It could always be worse.
4,0,0,Nobody said exposure therapy was quick or easy, but trust me -- it works.
4,0,0,Life's ten percent training and eighty percent toughness.
4,0,0,The D train is much, much faster than the A train, trust me.
3,1,0,So if we live we'll finally be covered by our insurance plan? Cool.
4,0,0,Rest in "pieces." - Thomas the train
5,3,0,This should cement our disability case.
4,0,0,I wonder what the boss meant by "Re-Training".
6,2,1,Be careful...don't touch the third rail
4,1,0,We'll have to change at 145th street to the "A" to get to Presbyterian Medical Center on 168th street.
4,0,0,Oh man, I wanted to get struck by the E train this time.
4,0,0,Living on the D line has its drawbacks.
4,0,0,Look harder - there IS a face there . . .
4,0,0,I admit that I didn't really investigate the Pullman Health Insurance facilities before I signed up.
7,0,0,There’s no better way to conquer your fear of injuries.
5,3,1,I think we're on the wrong track.
6,2,0,I hate waiting for trains, don't you?
4,0,0,Some wrap party, where is everyone?
4,0,0,I would have lost that bet.
4,1,0,You won't have to worry about the bill.
4,0,0,Don't worry. This time I know we've got it right.
4,0,0,I told you, the Drumpf train would be worse.
4,0,0,This is the High Line, isn't it?
5,4,1,I never said your fear of trains was irrational.
5,1,0,As they say: try, try again.
4,1,0,Dr. Mortimer's dream theory suffers a major setback.
5,2,0,If this doesn't work, we'll try a Trump rally again.
5,2,0,It would be the last time either of them said "What could possibly go wrong?"
4,1,0,Today I'm going to have to cut you off early.
4,0,0,I've named my penis Mr. Bates.
4,5,0,Why don't you just buy a watch?
6,0,1,If it doesn’t work this time, I’m moving to Oregon.
6,2,1,Your mother hated you.
4,1,0,This is us.
4,1,0,This is not what I meant when I said that we should downsize and travel more.
5,3,0,Are you sure we're on the side track this time?
4,1,0,This time we'll show that the Affordable Care Act is a scam!!!
4,0,0,The way our lucks been going lately, I can't believe it missed us.
5,1,0,It's early.
4,1,0,Well, Gary, let's hope the third time's the charm for these life insurance policies.
5,1,0,We are the 99%!
6,3,2,Frank, I'm starting to doubt that homeopathy is supposed to work this way.
6,2,1,This re-enactment may help the jury, but where will it land us?
6,2,1,Since our last session, I've come to the conclusion your paranoia is justified.
6,0,1,Psychologically, we're making progress. But physically...
5,2,0,Doctor, seems we're not on the right track this session.
5,0,1,Noise ?? What noise ??
5,0,0,We'll cure your self-destruction tendency for real this time. My bad on the Trump rally.
5,2,0,At least he's in-network.
6,1,1,I said ‘Uber’ not ‘unter’!
4,0,0,I hope you pulled the hand break this time......
4,0,0,I hope your ex was right, when she said, "third time's a charm!"
4,1,0,It's painful for me too, but this won't work unless we stay on track.
4,1,0,i think i can-in confidence-confirm, mr egglesby- that yours is an authentic case of 'one-track-mind'
6,1,1,If facing your train phobia head-on fails again, we'll try some drugs.
5,2,0,I'm not moving again. You?
4,0,0,This commute is murder!
4,1,0,Man, I wish I knew how to quit you!
4,0,0,I have been through this before; and you?
5,3,1,Does "the end of the line" mean anything to you metaphorically?
4,0,0,Maybe we’re using an outdated timetable.
4,0,0,Solidarity, my foot...no sit-down strike was meant to go this far.
3,1,0,OK, so I was wrong last time...but this is definitely the High Line.
3,0,0,Is that what he meant by escapade?
4,0,0,Nobody said couch surfing would be easy.
4,0,0,The doctor said to stay on track and we should heal just fine
5,3,1,I know it will stop this time!
4,1,0,They did say that trainees would be taking care of us.
4,1,0,Do you think SPF 50 is enough for now?
4,2,0,See? It's not really about Kate. Sometimes a train in a tunnel is just a train in a tunnel.
4,2,0,They pay more if you have a pre-existing condition.
4,0,0,Our Die is Cast
4,1,0,Maybe now we'll meet our deductible.
6,2,0,I get that your childhood was a trainwreck but I'm not sure reconstructing the memory is helping.
4,0,0,I think our therapy session have been on the wrong track
5,4,1,After our last session nothing would surprise me.
4,0,0,Visiting hours are every 12 minutes.
5,0,0,This Obamacare has gone way too far
4,1,0,I think the D Train is more reliable
4,1,0,Do you think the "D" takes us to the hospital?
4,0,0,Some people never learn...doing the same over and over, but expecting different results!
5,2,0,Looks like the D is the only thing that's not broken.
6,2,1,I've been feeling so run down lately.
6,4,2,This isn't what I meant by back on track
4,0,0,Once again, I am the doctor you are the patient, I know this will eventually cure your Siderodromophobia.
4,2,0,Don't you just love the look on the Engineer's face?
4,0,0,So I guess that that light at the end of the tunnel was not your missing flashlight?
5,1,0,Maybe we should call it The Breaking of Pelham 1 2 3
6,1,1,Trust me, immersion therapy is the only cure for siderodromophob…
4,0,0,Your recurring dreams are having a profound effect on both of us. I am beginning to have doubts about your insistence that we live in a different dimension.
5,2,0,Of course this is the proper way to do exposure therapy.
6,2,1,I'm Jake. From State Farm.
4,0,0,You sure doing this again is a good idea?
5,3,0,What more could possibly happen to us here?
4,0,0,How does the train stay on the tracks? There are no wheels on the right side.
6,1,1,Tom's new therapist was a train wreck.
4,0,0,Well, yes, there are methods of addressing your fears other than facing them head on. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,I wish something would happen to impact my recovery time.
7,1,1,So in that dream...did the train back up?
5,2,0,I feel so lucky to have found someone with similar interests.
6,1,1,And why do you think our sessions are doing more harm than good?
4,0,0,Yes, Fred, I know. "We were here first."
4,0,0,I keep telling you this isn't the luge run.
4,0,0,I would give my right arm for that chair.
5,2,0,They're not going to pull that eminent domain thing on us.
4,0,0,Not again!
5,3,0,Ready to try again?
4,0,0,D is for Destiny man!
4,1,0,They never give us a full 15 minute break anymore.
4,1,0,Hey, Uber didn't work so great in the beginning either.
5,2,0,How many times do we have to go over this, Chuck? If a train leaves the station at 9:15 AM and there are...
4,1,0,This is the last time I play Chicken with you.
6,0,0,This last treatment should finally put and end to your fear of trains
4,1,0,I feel that the train hallucination is becoming more real
3,0,0,Projection: Not fast enough. Will only break my glasses.
4,1,0,This was the cheapest office that I could afford.
4,0,0,Whew! It's on time.
4,1,0,Do you still advise me to live in the moment and not worry about the future?
5,2,0,The D is so unreliable.
5,2,0,Doc, sorry to drag you into this recurring nightmare of mine.
6,1,0,We don't sweat the small stuff.
5,2,0,Do you think our YouTube video of this will get one million hits?
4,0,0,The 'limited' transportation option had a lower deductible.
7,0,2,I thought you said reliving the experience would take the fear away.
7,6,5,Let's not forget what happened the last time our session ran late.
5,3,0,I'd welcome the other side of the tracks.
5,0,0,We have to keep working on your fear of trains.
4,1,0,The D train is the fastest way to Yankee Stadium.
6,2,1,"I'd like to revise my paranoia diagnosis.
4,1,0,Okay, today's exercise should clear up your siderodromophobia
5,2,1,Think it is too late to sign up for Obamacare?
4,0,0,Did you hear? We are on track to a full recovery...
4,0,0,What's he grinning about?
4,1,0,It's the price you pay for living life in the fast lane.
5,3,1,Didn't he say, "Stay on track for a full recovery"?
4,1,0,Hombre , it's not the speed , it' the direction ...
4,1,0,But as we established last week, the Subway DOES exist.
4,0,0,I'm still not over my fear of trains.
6,2,1,It's what you take away from the experience that counts.
7,0,2,Relax. They announced a sick passenger.
4,0,0,Tell me again, Fred, what's that word for "calm after the storm'?
5,0,0,Maybe 4 a day somewhere. Why?
4,2,0,Don't you think we need a break?
6,1,1,Who was it again who said, "the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results?"
5,3,1,When the agent said the listing was a tad rustic but very convenient to the D Train, we should have asked, "How rustic and how convenient?"
4,0,0,Well you're definitely not subwayphobic.
6,0,1,It never occurred to me that the judge would award us the subway car as punitive damages.
4,0,0,What are the odds it could happen twice?!
5,0,0,Be careful not to touch the third rail, I heard it could be fatal
4,0,0,Who the hell booked this re-match?
4,1,0,Looks like they fixed that switch
4,0,0,I still say the exposed brick walls are worth it.
4,0,0,We're on track for recovery.
4,0,0,Well... At least we found out our final stop.
2,0,0,I think we've covered this issue enough.
4,0,0,For the next visit, let's focus on reducing stress.
7,7,4,Now I want you to pay attention to how this makes you feel.
4,1,0,Still less painful then going through our insurance.
4,1,0,...and the insurance company won't suspect a thing!!!
5,2,0,But, it's like I told you last time: What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
6,0,1,We probably shouldn't have signed up for the fast-track coverage.
4,0,0,Now I know what the light at the end of the tunnel really was.
4,1,0,Wow this television is really realistic!
4,0,0,I'm starting to wish you'd responded to guided image therapy
4,1,0,I am not sure the insurance company is going to buy this.
6,0,1,And remember: Don't touch the third rail.
4,0,0,I still say if we didn't take enough Vicodin; this will really hurt.
5,2,0,Imagine where we'd be without Obamacare!
5,0,0,This doctor is in training!
4,0,0,Can't let them get to the Trump rally.
4,0,0,Are you sure that lightening never strikes the same place twice?
6,2,1,"How many times must I prove to you that MASS times ACCELERATION equals FORCE?
4,0,0,On the bright side, this rental is close to everything.
4,0,0,I have a big beautiful plot reserved on cloud nine.
4,1,0,I heard that.
4,0,0,Doc, I think I am getting over my train fetish.
5,1,0,This time my lawyer says they will have no basis to claim they did not know we were this crazy.
4,0,0,Don't touch that third rail.
5,1,0,I SAID, "I THINK THE TRAIN IS COMING!"
5,3,0,Life is about putting your best foot forward and then seeing where things lead
4,0,0,I'm pretty sure we are at the end of our sessions.
4,0,0,Sometimes a train going through a tunnel is just a train going through a tunnel, you know.
4,0,0,We got railroaded.
5,0,0,Looks like they boarded the hobos instead.
5,0,0,It's known as vibrational rehab - you'll see......
6,2,2,So I thought, "Why am I in such pain?" Then, it hit me.
3,0,0,I heard of traveling psychologists, but this takes it to a new level.
4,0,0,Not to worry, they're missing half their wheels
5,0,0,I'm telling you, we have to get the demo tape for Survivor just right.
3,1,1,This is the point where I usually wake up.
4,0,0,I really should have sent you to a hypnotist
3,1,0,This isn't what I meant by 'see you on the other side.'
5,2,0,If you're not committed to the therapeutic relationship, there's not much I can do to help you.
4,0,0,I'm telling you, this is it. The VA never makes a mistake.
6,2,1,The payout should be better this time
6,0,1,Damn! I was really hoping it would be the F train.
4,2,0,Relax, you've met your annual deductible. From here on it's just a simple co-pay.
4,0,0,I don't care what they do, I'm still not voting for Trump.
4,1,0,My lawyer says if I can keep faking it I am on track for a big settlement.
5,0,0,I'm beginning to think the new product durability standards are a little extreme.
5,0,0,I told you to find a place near the D Line, not on the D Line!
6,1,1,I wouldn't swear to it but I think we were in front last time.
4,1,0,I have come to the unexpected conclusion that your anxieties are well founded.
5,2,0,But we still have two days on our Metrocards.
5,3,1,Looks like our time is up for today Gary
4,0,0,Well, hopefully this is the last time we get hit by the D
4,2,0,This ought to help with your insomnia.
4,0,0,This is why I always sit upright. All I have to do is tilt back and I'm safe.
7,3,1,Relax. What are the odds of it happening again?
4,0,0,On second thought, I don't find your fear of trains unhealthy
4,0,0,I think our recovery is right on track.
6,1,2,Most of my patients have trust issues.
4,0,0,Yep, it's all about being mindful and noticing.
4,0,0,Not many couples showed up for the Double-Double Indemity party.
6,0,1,Are you sure this is the best way to get train watching into the X Games?
4,0,0,Forget trolleys and streetcars. It's all about trains.
4,0,0,I still don't think this qualifies as an extreme sport.
4,0,0,I still miss Johnny Carson.
5,0,0,The Doctor just said, 'Stay out of harm's way from now on and you'll be all right.'
4,0,0,Why do we keep testing our luck?
6,0,0,Perhaps we should reconsider exposure therapy.
4,1,0,I love living at the last stop. You don't have to rush to catch the train. It always travels in your direction.
4,1,0,With this we should be able to meet our deductible.
4,1,0,The air down here is going to kill us one of these days.
4,0,0,Those Trump people really hold a grudge.
4,0,0,You know, this exposure therapy is really working!
4,0,0,Don't sweat the delay, Phil. This time we're the sick ones.
4,1,0,I've always wanted track lighting
5,3,0,As I've said before, the only way to deal with a phobia is to confront it head on.
4,0,0,If train D leaves the Chicago at 8:00 and train B leaves Boston at 10:00 which one will reach us first? Didn't we get this one wrong last time????
4,0,0,Nobody can eavesdrop here.
4,1,0,I dunno Bob, I just feel like Trump speaks for me.
5,3,1,So you feel like sometimes you're simply on the wrong track?
4,0,0,This will be easy compared to your fear of Trump rallies.
5,0,0,My big shot brother is into extreme sports so I thought for once I'd outdo him.
4,1,0,Second time is the charm.
4,0,0,When you said we should jump under the D train, I thought you meant Trump.
4,0,0,Say what you want about the ACA - that was the fastest medical care ever.
4,0,0,Cast for "Murder on the Orient Express", you say?
4,0,0,Us jumping off the roof helped with your vertigo.
4,1,0,This is what we get for enrolling in Medicare Part D?
4,0,0,You think we should duck
4,0,0,Well, you were late Bob - it's Spring forward. The good seats in front of the train were taken.
5,0,0,See Tracks? Think Train!
6,1,1,You say you are experiencing a case of "D" ja vu?
5,0,0,what's he going to do, hit us?
4,0,0,Can't say we didn't try.
4,0,0,You brought I D...right?
4,0,0,Yeah, I support euthanasia. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,True, 'breezy' was a little misleading. But you have to admit the rent is cheap.
6,0,1,Sorry, I lost my train of thought.
5,3,1,I gotta say, Bill, I'm starting to feel really run down lately.
4,0,0,wow-it sure was lucky we were hit by the train on the way to the orthopedic surgery conference
4,1,0,Next week, can I confront my fear of the B train?
5,4,0,And how long have you had this fear of the letter"D"?
4,0,0,We were rehabing until the D train passed by us!
4,0,0,A few more broken ribs, and those season tickets are ours.
7,0,2,This time? Jennifer's tuition.
4,1,0,Where'd you say Verna got the name of that ambulance chaser?
6,3,0,Hold on to that train of thought again.
4,1,0,I don't know Doc'... I'm beginning to suspect that this isn't the best way for me to get over my fear of trains...
4,0,0,Next stop: that Grand Concourse in the sky.
4,0,0,How is this any better than your last idea?
4,1,0,We should have taken the A train.
8,1,4,I see our time is up.
6,0,1,How did that make you feel?
6,3,2,Perhaps exposure therapy wasn't the best way to go in your case...
4,0,0,So I dreamt that your office was on the subway tracks, and we were both wearing large casts, and we were about to be obliterated by a D train car with wheels on only one side. And right now, I'm feeling a strong sense of deja vu.
4,0,0,It's a living...
4,0,0,Is it on time?
4,0,0,Wait, is it coming or going?
5,3,0,This airbnb is definitely better than last week's.
7,1,3,The menu on this train is offers duck or squash. Your choice.
4,1,0,The "D" stand for we're dead man and don't be late!
5,2,0,Well, we dodged a bullet there!
5,0,0,When the doctor said we were lucky, let's see how lucky.
4,0,0,I hear they're hiring at the airport.
4,0,0,When did you hear this line was out of service?
5,1,0,Look on the bright side, we no longer put up with these bandages.
4,0,0,Doctor, my nightmares are getting more & more realistic.
4,1,0,We'll get it right this time.
5,1,0,I'd rather be at a trump rally
4,1,0,I'm finally getting my life on track.
7,0,2,Trainspotting isn't much fun.
4,1,0,Lightning never strikes twice.
6,3,1,It's really best to face these fears head on...
4,1,0,It still beats than the crowds at the High Line.
4,0,0,Now that we have Obamacare we can live where we want.
2,0,0,In an overreaching effort to fully empathize, Bob's therapist bandaged up and relocated their session to the scene of the accident.
5,5,0,I warned you I was a train wreck waiting to happen.
5,0,0,Brighto! Brighto! It makes old bodies new. We'll sell a million bottles.
4,0,0,You go ahead. I'm waiting for the "A" train.
5,2,0,Doc said if we stay on track we'll get better faster.
4,0,0,Don't worry; we're on the E train track.
7,1,1,I thought Rx stood for Railroad crossing!
5,3,1,Let's talk some more about this reoccurring dream of yours.
4,0,0,Bob, do you feel like play bowling tomorrow?
4,4,0,Is it lightning or transit trains you can only be hit by once? I always get confused.
4,0,0,Life was easier before PETA.
5,1,0,This is the only way I can get Fentanyl.
4,1,0,Unfortunately it looks like our time is just about up.
5,1,0,Now in this particular role play, you simply remember not to touch the third rail.
4,3,0,Aversion therapy is always a little unpleasant.
6,0,1,I say, "Let's give it another 30 minutes, then we'll do the numbers"
6,1,2,Wait, so...daylight savings already started?
6,2,1,Oh, you're just a glass half empty guy.
5,2,0,Well this time I'm not moving until I see a really good reason to!
4,1,0,Practice makes perfect
4,0,0,I haven't quite reached my annual deductible yet, how 'bout you?
4,1,0,After this, our health insurance will finally pay for everything.
4,0,0,And they told me I couldn't even kill myself properly.
4,1,0,Again, sometimes a train is just a train.
4,0,0,The morpheme's wearing off.
4,0,0,Do you think it is time to switch tracks?
5,2,0,Well, it can't get any worse...
4,0,0,I sat us here because the other side has the third rail.
4,1,0,No way this train arrives on time twice in a row.
4,1,0,What doesn't kill you...
4,0,0,So, I said, pay a little more and get the lower deductible, but no... she says the rates are too high as it is.
6,0,0,That damn train is sawing us to pieces - back and forth, back and forth!
3,0,0,"If you see something, say something." Submitted by Douglas Monaghan, Floral Park, NY
4,0,0,This should be your final phase of therapy.
4,0,0,Trust me, by now we should be immune to collisions.
3,0,0,This is stupid, Rex. Assisted suicide is legal in this state.
4,1,0,The MTA is gonna strike again
4,0,0,We're finally on the fast track.
5,2,0,Now that's a fast HMO Express!
4,0,0,And I thought we Republicans would be safe when all the wheels came completely off one side of Donald Trump's GOP train wreck - I guess not.
4,0,0,...You derailed and we are right on track.
5,2,0,I know, it's never quite like the first time.
4,0,0,I'd like to discuss with you a better way of dealing with your nightmares
6,2,2,Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
5,3,0,So let's talk about your irrational fear of trains.
4,0,0,You said you think you see the light at the end of the tunnel. How does that make you feel?
6,2,1,Looks like we're on the wrong side of the tracks again
7,1,1,It's on time! This is the best luck I've had in 2 months,
4,0,0,Cast-offs
6,0,1,When does disability kick in?
5,1,0,Never let a suicidal patient pick the meeting places.
4,0,0,I got this one tangling with a rickshaw in Calcutta
5,1,0,Don't worry , it's just the deductible .
6,0,0,Stop complaing. They're always late.
4,1,0,We might not like it, but Pres. Trump's made the trains run on time.
4,0,0,I hope these sessions are helping overcome your fear of pain.
4,1,0,Now, I think we're all feeling a little hurt after last week's session.
4,0,0,Let's continue working on overcoming my mental block to learning schedules.
4,1,0,Maybe we'll finally meet our deductible.
4,0,0,You and I, we're gonna keep trying to lick this subway phobia of yours, if it's the last thing we do!
5,1,0,Deja vu?
5,2,0,Are you sure this is how exposure therapy works doctor?
4,0,0,I now own six of these. It's worth it.
4,0,0,This better work this time.
4,0,0,... and you will feel no more pain at the count of three ... 1... 2...
4,1,0,Sometimes, I just feel accident-prone.
4,0,0,I kind of liked the park bench.
4,1,0,The 'Subway Fixer Upper' is right on time.
6,2,1,I told you the express would be quicker!
5,1,0,They provide great benefits, don't they?
4,0,0,Do I believe in miracles? Why do you even ask?
6,0,1,On the bright side, I'm finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
3,0,0,Can't you see why we can't meet here....
5,4,0,This time I get to pick the lawyer.
5,2,0,Well Mr. Dillon, it looks like our time is up for today. Same time next week?
4,1,0,On the bright side, the rent is affordable.
4,1,0,Let's go for broke.
6,1,2,I don't get it. I've always heard "just stay away from the third rail and you'll be fine."
4,0,0,When's your office remodel supposed to be finished?
4,0,0,So this is President Trump's healthcare plan!
4,1,0,Patient exhibits signs of derailment. What color tie should I wear tomorrow?
4,0,0,We're in a safe space
4,0,0,It's just ridiculous how high transit fares have gotten.
4,1,0,Well, there's always parachute-less skydiving.
5,2,0,I wouldn't have taken him literally when he said we were on track for retirement.
5,0,0,One more and I can actually buy a place on this line.
5,0,0,I'm voting for Bernie! My hedge fund is in the toilet.
4,1,0,I don't understand why so few people are showing up to our support group
4,0,0,That concludes our sessions on trains, next week we'll move to airplanes
4,0,0,They're gaining on us. Who are these guys?
4,1,0,No problem, we're at 206th street.
4,0,0,Like I told you last time, we hold sessions here because your insurance will only cover counselling as part of an emergency department visit.
4,1,0,I know a really great place to be on life support.
4,0,0,I seem to have one medical emergency after another lately.
4,1,0,I feel we're on track for a speedy recovery.
4,0,0,Like you said---the D stands for Dare.
5,1,0,They won't be able to deny us disability this time!
4,0,0,Tell me again how re-enactment therapy works.
6,0,1,The hopefully final meeting of the Hemlock Society will now come to order.
4,0,0,We'd better go. I hear this is Snidely Whiplash's train.
5,2,0,Well, this is the end of the line in more ways than one.
4,5,0,Now, let's see if New York understands installation art.
4,0,0,when the presidential elections hit
4,0,0,I told you all we would do jumping off the roof was break a few bones. Now this ought to work!!
5,0,0,I object, you have the better seat.
4,0,0,I wish the F wasn't down.
4,0,0,Give me your tired, poor, broken, wretched refuse, homeless, recession-tossed, teeming city.
4,0,0,Hooray, they stopped - third time lucky.
4,0,0,Four down and only twenty-two to go!
6,0,0,Make no bones about it--the train is never, never late.
6,0,0,Only you would pick train dummy over car dummy.
6,4,2,I'm afraid that's all the time we have today.
4,0,0,This is not what I meant when I asked if our retirement plan was on track.
8,0,0,So, brainy, this double suicide idea has already cost three arms and a leg!
5,0,0,Jeez, another goddamn D Train.
4,0,0,Not to worry honey---our insurgence covers pre-existing conditions.
3,0,0,We have friendship goals Bill.
6,2,1,I'm a laid-back type of self-destructive.
5,0,0,I guess they weren't kidding when they said sitting at the front of the train this time would cost us an arm and a leg...
5,3,0,I never can remember which train is local and which is express.
5,1,2,Relax, we've met the deductible.
4,4,0,Are you certain Medicare will cover this?
4,0,0,I know it's been hard, but your treatment is right on track.
5,3,0,I thought 'Obama-care' would go off the tracks
4,0,0,I hate Tom for doing this to us
4,1,0,Yeah, 'Blood On The Tracks' was my favorite Dylan album too!
4,0,0,Before retiring, I never understood it when they would say that 'Medicare is the third rail of American Politics.'
5,1,0,Most psychoanalysts would have predicted an F train again.
6,1,1,Next week, same time, same place.
4,0,0,Now that we paid our deductible, we'll get covered this time.
4,0,0,So yes, your need for codependency is the need this will be our last session.
4,0,0,I'm trying to live more in the moment.
5,0,0,It's my way or the highway.
5,0,0,To discourage patients from going over time. Which once again, you have.
4,0,0,I call it the My Line.
5,0,0,I'm giving up on subway assisted suicide.
4,1,0,How 'bout those Mets?
4,0,0,You feel as though something catastrophic is bearing down on you. Hmmm...tell me more about that.
4,0,0,I like doing slapstick therapy but the group sessions are killing me.
6,0,1," Living in the subway is a little challenging , but it is so convenient " !
4,0,0,I told you we weren't lucky.
4,0,0,So I said, "No way am I paying a copay on my health insurance. You have not seen the last of James Arbuckle!"
3,1,0,Good idea, these lounge chairs. This way, they can't say we're accident prone.
6,0,1,Watch out for the third rail.
5,5,1,OK, maybe they'll get it right this time.
4,1,0,And what does this 'big train' remind you of?
4,1,0,I know I need to quit this, but I'm not sure I've hit 'rock bottom' yet.
5,3,1,Facing your fear, take two.
4,0,0,Are we really supposed to be comfortable doing this?
5,0,0,We fall down the steps reading our New Yorker and this is how they make an example of us??
5,2,0,Some waiting room. I understand the doctor's in training.
4,1,0,I get claustrophobic in tunnels.
4,0,0,This is 'Psycho' therapy
4,0,0,I can see why you're $400 an hour.
4,0,0,I still have that feeling of impending doom.
6,0,1,We should just call in sick next time.
4,0,0,Being in training is harder than I thought.
6,2,1,Your hallucinations just got a lot worse.
4,1,0,This is The MTA with an important message: There has been a regression on the track.
3,0,0,I heard that if you got hit again, your body would balance itself out.
5,4,0,When you said a little R&R I didn't think you meant railroad.
5,1,0,Sticks and stones can break my bones but trains will never hurt me.
4,1,0,Maybe we should rethink this Airbnb, the location is great, but...
4,1,0,Where else you gonna get part-time and benefits?
6,2,0,It still beats paying for HBO.
5,0,1,Maybe we're not cut out for full contact trainspotting.
4,1,0,He did say it was "On the D-train".
6,0,1,Their triage was good as far as it went!
5,0,0,We'll get this 'exposure therapy' treatment in the next go 'round if it kills us.
4,0,0,Can't believe it, another Express!
4,0,0,They'll blame this on Obamacare, too!
5,3,0,I didn't think it would be THIS hard to stop smoking, Doc...
3,0,0,They only allow one carry on
4,1,0,OK, now concentrate and visualize what the train wheels looked like on the other side
4,1,0,Your fears are genuine and deep-seated.
5,3,1,This time, I expect a different result.
4,0,0,You really do only live once.
7,1,3,One more after this and we'll be able to meet our deductible.
4,1,0,Yeah, we missed it but you still can't say we've never caught a break.
4,0,0,Oh crap! I forgot to re-fill my MetroCard.
4,0,0,I forgot the punchline.
6,0,1,Those upper class hobos don't know what their missing!
9,0,0,Train surfing is for chickens
4,0,0,The Republicans say they are going to repeal Obama-Care, so lets get our money's worth!
6,1,2,Wait, I thought it was accidental death OR dismemberment!
4,0,0,So much for your idea of a staycation
4,1,0,On the other hand, it's rent controlled.
4,0,0,Well done We have conquered your fear of trains
4,0,0,Why else would we do this? We're jackasses.
5,1,0,Now that you're comfortable with planes and buses, let's try to attack your next phobia.
5,2,0,What do you think we got wrong last time?
4,0,0,It's rent controlled- now tell me more about your insecurities and anxieties.......
4,0,0,Can we both agree Method Acting wasn't right for this film!
3,0,0,It was either this or living off welfare
4,1,0,They usually stop.
6,0,1,Do you have anything else you want to say?
4,1,0,One more session aught to be enough to overcome your fear of trains.
5,2,0,I'm beginning to have second thoughts on your exposure therapy.
4,0,0,Might as well be comfortable until the lawyers come and, no, they won't notice the divan if we moan enough.
7,2,0,This didn't work out last time either.
6,0,1,You sure this will move us up on the V.A.'s backlog?
7,1,0,Might as well enjoy while we can.
7,0,3,Run over us once, shame on you! Run over us twice,shame on us!
5,2,0,Would you mind switching seats?
4,1,0,I admire the tagger's use of shadow and light
4,0,0,No kidding? I got this falling off the platform, too.
5,1,0,Let' explore this recurring nightmare of yours.
6,2,1,They say the second time is less painful.
4,0,0,Trying to save the $2.75 fare for that Coney Island hot dog will kill us for sure.
7,0,0,We still must explore why you're obsessing over the D train when this is the C track.
4,1,0,Next time, I'm going to read the fine print on those discharge forms.
4,1,0,Not to worry; Accident Prone Disorder is my specialty.
4,0,0,We needed Bill Harlan's goat (Old high school ditty)
4,0,0,I'm pretty sure third time's the charm.
4,0,0,"Sorry we're on break,don't blame us for your troubles".
6,0,0,In your case, 'the end of the line' is far safer than being 'on the fast track.'
5,3,0,I think this dream you have of being in the path of an on-coming train might warrant further examination.
4,0,0,well, I think we've turned lemons into lemonade
4,0,0,This better work THIS time or you're a dead man. Actually...
4,1,0,Let's see them try to settle this one in Small Claims.
4,1,0,Wait, you don't have life insurance?
4,0,0,For the times a charm's sunset views over the Narrows.
5,2,0,Now how does one conquer their fears? Head on.
4,1,0,So tell me about your fear of being hit by a train
4,1,0,Just because you feel my pain doesn't mean you understand me.
5,0,0,They were really nice about helping us off the train.
4,1,0,My doctor says I'll be able to get out of rehab real soon!
4,1,0,Third time better be the charm.
4,1,0,It's not as safe to wait for the D train here, but at least it smells better than the platform.
4,0,0,I'm feeling fine. How are you?
6,1,1,When it starts, what if it's going away from us?
4,0,0,For the last time, this is NOT the Highline.
4,0,0,Remember, Doc said to stay on track!
4,1,0,They said we should take the A train
4,0,0,I sure thought our time was up. Good thing we were wearing our helmets.
4,0,0,We be laying laying down by the train listening to the tracks
4,1,0,I hope they have sorted this couch to train service
5,0,0,I hope you see now how your fear of being killed by a train was simply an irrational neurotic obsession.
4,1,0,It'd be kinda nice being in there right now wouldn't it?
4,0,0,What did you expect? We are at the outpatient ward for Highlines D.
5,0,0,So what you think: Is this a good time to call Cecelia?
6,0,1,Doc, I admit the Fight Club therapy sessions were good, but I think we're on the wrong track with this one...
4,1,0,Same light at the end of the tunnel as last time.
4,1,0,This is going to cost us an arm and a leg!
4,0,0,Sure glad it's not the A train again.
4,1,0,As avid locomotive enthusiasts, Dave and Tom never stopped to question their devotion.
6,0,1,What are the chances of it happening 7 times in a row?
4,1,0,Somehow train watching isn't what I expected.
5,3,1,...and there’s no such thing as global warming.
4,1,0,They don't make locomotives the way they used to. In the old days, we'd have still been in the hospital for another two or three weeks.
4,1,0,No, thinking about ones mortality is actually very common.
5,0,0,Now we know that your decidophobia is greater than your siderodromophobia, and that is why last week we met in front of the train and not behind it like today.
4,1,0,It's all about the gentle warm breeze.
4,1,0,Perfectly safe as long as you don't touch the third rail, why do you ask?
4,1,0,Once again, it looks like our time is up.
5,3,0,Just think - two more times and we get the world record.
4,0,0,Donald Trump said he built this train, a beautiful train, and paid for by Mexico.
5,3,1,Let's get your life back off track.
4,1,0,To management, "Request additional 6 months sick leave, starting tomorrow."
4,0,0,Don't look now, but this track was marked ACTIVE - NO RAIL FANS ALLOWED.
3,1,0,90-10 he doesn't stop in time.
4,0,0,The D Train is being recalled to the station permanently. This is a perfect place for convalescence because a genius could create another HIGH LINE.
4,3,1,Well, it looks like our time is about up again.
5,2,0,Looks like we've run over again.
4,0,0,Are you sure this is how David Blaine does it?
4,0,0,Ah, that's better. I just needed a little break.
5,1,0,Unless this is the outbound track I think that we may be in for bigger problems.
4,0,0,If at first you don't succeed ...
5,2,0,Anything new?
4,1,0,Thank goodness for Obamacare.
5,0,0,Are you sure we have access to all public spaces?
4,0,0,How has the systematic desensitization therapy been going for you so far?
4,0,0,The train in the tunnel dream again?
4,0,0,It's a bit early, but would you mind if I billed for the full hour?
4,0,0,we never should have moved to Canada.
6,0,1,Whoops! Almost touched the third rail there.
4,0,0,This is their idea of workmen's comp?
4,1,0,That's the last time I use Craigslist.
4,1,0,Sorry doc, my insurance doesn't have triple indemnity.
4,0,0,Harry we lost track of our train!!!
4,0,0,I find this setting gives my patients a greater sense of urgency.
4,0,0,I've heard travel is broadening
5,4,1,It seems to me to be a case of repetitive train injury.
4,1,0,Eventually you'll begin to _fear_ getting hit by the train.
5,2,0,My life also started out on the wrong side of the tracks.
6,1,0,But surely Mr. Johnson you realize that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome is just plain--
4,0,0,And then we wake up......Right?
4,0,0,I would have preferred a better view, but the price was right.
6,0,1,Have you ever seen the movie "Trainspotting"?
5,1,0,Can you spell d-i-s-a-b-i-l-i-t-y !
7,1,1,We're getting towards the end of our exposure therapy.
7,0,2,We should have listened to Ellington.
4,0,0,We've made great progress - this time it will be different.
6,1,1,See?! This is exactly the type of HMO screw ups which are totally avoidable.
5,0,0,Obama care still sucks.
4,0,0,This feels like one of those new reality shows.
4,0,0,I've always been a pessimist
4,0,0,They'll have to hike the fare to 5 bucks for the settlement we'll get.
7,1,0,How did you hear about this magic bullet treatment again?
4,0,0,I think it's time to go off the rails.
5,2,0,I'm 99% sure it's traveling away from us this time.
4,1,0,I thought 'Watch the Gap' was just for the riders.
4,0,0,I thought you said the D was always delayed?
4,0,0,Location, Location. . .
4,1,0,You were right, we should have just taken a cab
4,0,0,This still isn't quite the way I thought we could explore your inner fears.
5,1,0,Hit by train once shame on us. Hit by train twice....
6,1,1,Face it -- we're not accident prone, we're just stupid.
5,2,0,Are you sure that's a Timex?
6,0,1,They say this is the fastest track to the VA hospital.
4,0,0,Today, two old-men delayed the D-train departure. And now a word from our sponsor: Viagra.
6,0,1,There are better ways to decouple.
4,0,0,I'd rather watch 30 Rock from my comfy chair than run for the D train.
4,0,0,It would have been much worse if the train had wheels on the other track.
4,0,0,Since we don't have the money to live where you want and you won't live on the other side of the tracks, what other option is there?
4,1,0,Let me stop it with my cast!
4,1,0,Nah, we have plenty of time it's an NJ Transit train
4,0,0,Next, I'd like you to help me with my constant sense of foreboding.
4,0,0,Switching Trains is not the answer.
4,0,0,Oh, I thought the train would never make it here.
5,4,1,Well, my wife thinks I'm just accident-prone.
4,0,0,"Why is the cartoon not viewable?
4,0,0,Were the rehab directives to "Rest up and train at Track 10" or to "Rest up and train with traction?!"
5,2,0,The ADA ramp will pop out in just a second.
4,0,0,Maybe we should try dodging firetrucks next time.
4,0,0,They're not gaining on us!
5,1,0,This works much faster than aspirin alone.
3,0,0,Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith. Keith.
5,2,0,Are you sure this makes us stronger?
4,0,0,Don't worry, it is only the D train, and a woman is driving, the R will be along shortly.
4,1,0,The D Train is early today.
6,0,2,This ought to do it.
4,1,0,Tell him to stop!
5,0,0,That was a close call!
4,0,0,Let's go back to your over-reliance on similes...
4,1,0,Yeah, one of these weeks they'll be movin' this old subway car, and we'll hafta find another place to reminisce...
6,1,1,Don't worry, it's never on time.
4,0,0,I thought I could. I did too!
4,0,0,That's what you meant by 'end of the line'.
6,1,2,It's early, AGAIN!
4,1,0,I'd feel better if that "D" were changed to an "R."
5,1,0,Work with me, Ted. It's called experiential psychology for a reason.
4,0,0,This beats standing.
4,0,0,Looks like the D-train caught US.
6,0,1,Is your rehab on track?
4,0,0,Ever worry that we're on the wrong track?
5,0,0,Watch where your going train! Man trains just don't have respect for people anymore.
4,0,0,I told you to Take the A-Train.
5,3,0,I'm not sure your method of treating my train phobia is working.
5,2,0,Why yes, I do hear a speeding train.
6,0,1,Assuming you survive the therapy, your risk addiction will be cured. Assuming you survive the therapy, your risk addiction will be cured.
4,1,0,I think these lounge chairs hurt our credibility in court
4,0,0,Huh. Train's late.
6,4,2,I think this should be our last session.
5,0,0,I really hope that "D" stands for "death". Cuz' we have already tried "A", "B", and "C" trains. Ya know what i'm saying?
4,0,0,When my ex-wife said she was taking my Vitra lounger I knew that this is the only solution.
5,4,1,Sometimes in life we never know whats going to hit us.
5,3,0,Let's make this one count.
4,0,0,Waiting for the chaise lounge car
6,2,1,I understand the importance of getting our lives back on track after the accident, but I'm not sure this is what the doctor had in mind.
5,4,1,I think that that is all the time we have left for today.
5,4,0,The first few sessions are the hardest.
4,0,0,If you ask me, Blonde on Blonde is soooo much better than Blood on the Tracks.
4,0,0,It's absurd to say there's a relationship between CTE and lounging on railroad tracks!
4,0,0,Yeah, it looks like this one needs new brakes, too --
4,1,0,I hope you are right that the D Train has better insurance.
4,0,0,I just called the doctor - he says we're on track to get much worse.

4,0,0,Try to remember, when did you first have these thoughts of folie à deux.
4,0,0,I thought you said it would be the A train.
4,0,0,Fool me once ...
4,1,0,I guess this is what passes for healthcare these days.
5,1,0,YOU SEE, DR., MY MOTHER NEVER LOVED ME...
5,2,0,I guess we should've known the D stood for "Donald" when the wheels started falling off but it still somehow managed to stay on track and break us.
4,0,0,I told you, things are always better the second time around
4,0,0,Ok, who's the wise guy with the eraser?
7,1,1,I'm thinking we should go back to turnstile jumping.
4,0,0,If we are doing this again, we are on the wrong side of the tracks.
4,0,0,I thought you said you shut the door!
4,0,0,We've been railroaded in the literal sense of the word.

4,1,0,What makes you think that this time will be any different?
4,0,0,I'm so tired of this. Here it comes again.
4,0,0,It's just you and me, the reunion gets smaller each year.
6,1,1,I'm all for helping you confront your fears, but perhaps our third session could be in my office?
6,4,0,'No worries. He forgot to draw wheels on one of the sides.'
4,0,0,You sure those are phantom shakes?
6,0,0,How does it feel to be a human circuit breaker?
4,1,0,Life should only be so easy !
4,0,0,Didn't hear the train a comin', didn't see it rollin' around the bend and we aint seen sunshine since we got hit in the head.
4,0,0,I wonder what the wealther will be like tomorrow?
4,0,0,''Superman was busy.''
4,0,0,It was traumatic for you, and for me, but there's plenty of hope in the science of mindfulness.
4,0,0,On-site treatment of siderodromophobia has its drawbacks.
4,0,0,Didn't the doctor say we should be 'on track' to recuperate?
4,0,0,And to think, we paid almost a million for this view.
4,1,0,Oh, you have a fear of *planes*!
4,1,0,I've got a bad feeling about this exposure therapy.
4,0,0,We've been over this a thousand times Mr. Withersby - no train, no pain, no gain.
5,2,0,Beats being at a Donald Trump rally.
4,1,0,This is definitely in network
5,1,0,I'd really love a donut right about now.
5,0,0,My phone charges quickly on that third rail.
4,0,0,I'm not sure about this new health plan...
6,0,0,Let's hope it doesn't slow down because of train traffic in front us this time!
5,4,0,I'm not sure we are striking the right way.
4,1,0,I think you're afraid of confrontation
5,3,1,What's the definition of insanity again?
4,0,0,Going out on our own Eames like we said we would, Helen
4,0,0,I will get hit by a train for you~
4,0,0,Unlike me, you didn't get unparalleled treatment...that staff had no training whatsoever.
4,1,0,I'm going downtown--on the express.
5,0,0,...talkin' about a figure of speech
3,0,0,I think our time is up.
4,0,0,Obamacare?
6,1,2,I'm thinking our time is up for today.
4,0,0,I guess this one isn't the High Line either.
4,0,0,Did you tell the conductor to stop the train at 59th Street?
4,0,0,You would think they'd learn by now.
5,3,1,You're afraid? Good! Use that emotion!
5,3,0,I just remembered why this is a bad idea.
4,1,0,With this final exercise, your desensitation will be complete. You will be cured of your siderodromophobia and can live a normal, healthy life.
4,0,0,No question, this D-Train sound is way better than what you get from the A-Train.
6,3,0,You're overwhelmed with a feeling of déjà what?
5,2,1,Hold that thought.
6,0,0,I told you not to pull the emergency cord.
6,0,1,I don't want to seem like a broken record, but it's time we moved to the right side of the tracks!
4,1,0,Let's continue where we left off last time...you were talking about your sense of doom, hmm?
4,0,0,No, I'm not feeling suicidal. Are you feeling suicidal?
4,0,0,Maybe next week we can move our session to my office?
4,0,0,Still beats riding the G.
6,2,1,I'm beginning to think this homeopathic regimen isn't working.
4,0,0,Are you sure we are on the right track to recovery?
4,0,0,This shouldn't be too bad...as long as one of us is dreaming.
4,0,0,You went too far just because the Harrisons bought a new SUV.
3,0,0,Here she is, right on time.
4,0,0,Well, I guess I wouldn't be afraid to get on a plane right now.
5,0,0,It's only the D. I worry more about the El... Or worse yet, the F.

5,2,0,The Mindfullness Gap
5,0,0,Whose idea was it to play Blind Man's Bluff?
4,0,0,Yessir, driving an automobile is a dangerous thing.
4,1,0,NOT to worry the train is NEVER on time!
5,2,0,"I say dear fellow, don't touch the third rail.
4,2,0,Trains and tunnels... how Freudian.
4,1,0,After this I think we'll be ready to tackle your fear the of heights.
4,1,0,Remember, they can't turn you away just because you have a pre-existing condition.
7,1,1,...The good news is that we'll be fully covered again under Obamacare.
4,1,0,Well, I am convinced that your Siderodromophobia is based in reality.
4,0,0,You sure the local goes fast enough to finish the job?
6,2,1,This could go one of two ways.
4,1,0,I think I'll go back to helping sex addicts.

4,1,0,He must know all the handicapped parking spots were taken
6,0,1,Do you smell the roses?

5,2,0,In our next session , we can cover how facing your fears is the key to happiness...
4,0,0,Are you sure this time that the insurance company pays quadruple if the train is heading westbound at 90 miles per hour?
4,1,0,Don't worry, you won't find a D train here, they take the bridge.
4,0,0,Nothing is ever easy.
4,0,0,I've decided to switch to a therapist who doesn't keep saying "things could be worse".
4,1,0,Their first attempt at suicide wasn't a success, so... "If at first you don't succeed, try, try, again", said by the famous William E. Hickson.
4,1,0,Let's call off the bet.
5,0,0,I have little doubt you could have found the words for these feelings.
4,0,0,Did you pay your copay?
4,0,0,Now that we've experienced being thrown under the bus, let's move on to our next challenge.
6,1,1,The victory of hope over experience.
4,0,0,These Driverless trains really work, call the union rep.
5,0,0,Standby just isn't what it used to be.
6,1,1,It is my professional opinion that you are obsessively fixated on the third rail and what it represents, though through our time together I admit I've come to appreciate your fixation, and even to share in it... you hear something?
4,0,0,It's tough being an establishment Republican this year.
4,1,0,Darn, I'm not supposed to move this arm.
4,0,0,The thing is, none of these captions that win are actually funny or witty in any way. So here's to life. Cross my heart and hope to die.
4,0,0,"Are you desensitized to your fear of trains yet?
5,2,0,Sorry—I got priced out of the A tunnel.
4,0,0,Have they not heard of "No Man Left Behind"!
4,0,0,Yes. 'D Train' is coming. Ho ho. How clever... Now I know why you were expelled from The Union Club.
4,1,0,You know Frank. This didn't work out too well the first time so explain to me why we're doing it again.
4,0,0,I thought you said we would be in the lounge car.
5,0,0,The view from the third rail.
4,0,0,Yeah, but this way we are not violating anyone's religious liberties.
3,0,0,THIS assisted suicide will work!
4,1,0,I'm not too bad. How about yourself?
4,0,0,I figure this is safer than out in front like last time.
4,0,0,Honey,wheres my eyeglasses?
6,2,1,You look like a train wreck
5,0,0,As careful as I am, I never seem to get out of harms way
4,1,0,I'll prove to you that it wasn't the third rail.
4,0,0,Welcome to hospice.
4,0,0,For my next feat I'm considering high-wire tap dancing.
4,1,0,Doctor, I went along with your fear of heights therapy, but I’m having second thought about this.
5,3,0,Tell me more about your deja vue.
5,2,0,Trust me on this...The second time's the charm.
3,0,0,Now where were we? Ah, yes. Feelings of being steamrolled.
4,1,0,I "I'm beginning to regret that 'Doctors without MetroCards' joke I made at the ER.
5,1,0,Do you think we'll get dental this time?
4,1,0,Next time Fred... You sit in the front seat...
4,0,0,Are you gonna breake my all of bones!!!???
4,0,0,Darn! My cast itches.
5,3,0,It DOES remind me of The Little Engine That Could!
4,0,0,I hope they fixed those back up lights.
4,1,0,okay , here is how shock therapy works
5,3,1,No more Uber trains for me.
5,3,0,I swore I'd help you or die trying.
5,4,1,I told you there was a light at the end of the tunnel.
6,2,0,Did Frank Underwood recommend you?
4,1,0,I hear the drivers will meet the track workers soon to go over our complaint.
6,1,1,I blame Obama.
6,0,0,No, as a matter of fact, I do not think we're too close to the third rail again.
4,1,0,These helmets are great!
4,1,0,Suddenly, being on the wrong side of the tracks doesn't sound so bad!
4,0,0,The policy did say death AND disability.
5,1,0,Let's just watch the ballgame at home, you said...
6,0,1,You have to be on the tracks to get hit by the train.
4,0,0,jumping off the lazy train took more work than expected
5,3,0,One more shift into reverse, and we'll be flying first class.
6,2,1,So... last time we worked on your fear of heights...
4,1,0,The view from this Airbnb isn't that much better than the last one.
6,2,1,There's no way we'll be struck twice.
4,0,0,Is this what they mean by deja vu?
4,0,0,I knew this boycott for a lounge car was a bad idea!
6,1,1,So ya think I have loco-motives?
4,0,0,Spring break therapist
4,1,0,Train workers never strike twice!
4,0,0,I thought that went well - considering
4,0,0,You were supposed to take the "A" train.
4,0,0,Do you think they forgot about us?
5,2,0,You're right, it's hard to pin that one on mom.
4,1,0,So then she said it was time for 'exposure therapy'...
6,0,1,Yes, of course our situation is lamentable. But I’ve got some news for you, Harry. Our situation is not nearly as lamentable as the prospect of being struck by a subway car that is rolling toward us even without a set of wheels.
6,1,1,This time remember! We go on 3!
4,0,0,I'll admit I was a little skeptical about having this reunion.
4,0,0,I think this is the wrong train track, we should be on the E-Line.
4,0,0,Maybe this transporting idea wasn't very good after all.
5,0,0,Amtrak, what'd I tell you?
4,1,0,A light at the end of the tunnel indeed. Be careful what you wish for...
7,0,1,I'm thinking now that the N train will be a bit of a stretch for us.
4,0,0,Don't worry, as soon as you finish your training you'll be first aid qualified.
4,1,0,I paid extra for the lounge car.
6,2,1,Whew!Another close call!
5,2,0,I hear this is an up and coming hipster area.
5,3,1,Shoot, I think left the stove on.
4,0,0,I am not drunk, the horse is.
4,1,0,I think we're both suffering from a one-track mind.
4,0,0,I think we're at the point where we can put your fear of getting hit by a subway train to rest.
4,0,0,When they said it would be an arm and a leg they really meant it!
3,0,0,So how did you track me down?
4,0,0,I'm not sure heckling The Donald is worth the risk.
4,0,0,Is that the local or express?
5,0,0,Feel the burn?
4,0,0,Where're the media?
2,0,0,We're being held because of train traffic ahead of us.
4,0,0,You seem to be overly fixated on this 'fear of trains.'
5,1,0,This seems as good a place as any to recuperate until the "E" car arrives.
5,4,0,What's the worst that could happen?
4,1,0,We've learned that your fears are very real.
4,0,0,Hanna and Sophia give up as feminists.
4,0,0,Our discount medical evacuation policy stinks.
4,0,0,Perhaps reenactment is not the key to insight after all
4,3,1,Waiting for Godot takes on new meaning on New York's subway tracks.
5,2,0,You see, doc, I keep hearing these loud whistles then I wake up in the hospital.
4,0,0,..."that Kevorkian guy still around?"
5,1,0,I'm beginning to think we have an incorrect understanding of "trainspotting."
4,1,0,You can take a taxi if you want to. I am waiting right here for d' ambulance.
4,0,0,Remember, be mindful of the third rail.
4,0,0,Slippery when wet, no kidding.
4,1,0,Come on ya dumb train, double or nothin'.
8,1,1,Is that a smart watch?
4,0,0,I guess my fear of touching the third rail has been alleviated, but my overall sense of anxiety is increasing!
5,2,0,Under Obamacare this is the only Euthanasia covered.
7,0,1,Not only that, I'm also developing a vitamin D deficiency.
4,0,0,No, I'm in the dream too, so at least it's progress on trust issues.
4,0,0,Hey what does that D in the windows stand for? Oh it stands for d- ...
4,0,0,This time I really need you to believe that we're safe and sound in my office.
4,0,0,It's all about being at the right place at the right time.
5,2,0,I thought you called an ambulance.
4,1,0,No one forced you to hire the guy who teaches people to face their fears head-on.
4,0,0,In order for these sessions to work, we need to stay on track.
4,1,0,By golly, Bob, we've finally trained them!
5,3,0,In all fairness, Craigslist did say this would cost us an arm and a leg.
6,2,1,Let's enjoy the moment...
4,0,0,Just when I thought the MTA could not be a more painful experience
4,1,0,Not MY president.
4,0,0,So you forgot the remote again?
4,0,0,If we cause a wreck we're screwed.
4,0,0,Hold on, I have to catch a train.
4,0,0,It gets ya comin' and goin'.
5,1,0,Last time they said lie between the tracks, see where that got us....
1,0,0,Nothing like a little more pain to start the morning.
5,1,0,Yet another failure in reconnaissance.
4,0,0,"The conductor's first and last words to me were "hello" and goodbye".
6,3,1,You were saying, about the light at the end of the tunnel?
6,1,1,That was close.
5,3,2,Curing your fear of women was much less painful.
4,1,0,Oh God, here we go again.
4,0,0,D Train: Train of the damned.
4,0,0,We've overtrained again.
4,0,0,Good thing we paid the higher premium for luxury rest stops on hospital trains.
5,4,0,Well, it beats physical therapy.
5,0,0,I don't think this will get them the results they were looking for
4,0,0,You should see his bookshelf on GoodReads. No wonder he hasn't gotten to the ADA.
4,0,0,Three D's
4,0,0,If this doesn't work, I say let's give the George Washington Bridge another try.
5,1,0,Are you sure this is how you become a wizard?
6,2,2,I've tested a lot of products for a lot of purposes, but who's going to buy train proof outdoor furniture?
4,0,0,This one should be a real doozy.
4,1,0,I had a great job and a wonderful girlfriend in Paris, but I missed all this.
5,3,1,Yeah, they finally stopped dumping patients on the streets.
4,1,0,When did you first realize your life was off track?
4,0,0,Better not take that HMO train, it could be worse!
4,0,0,It's outside of network. But it has been precertified.
6,2,0,Next year, I pick the vacation spot.
4,0,0,Perhaps after A to C, D Train will cure you of your siderodromophobia
7,0,0,Just get us out of our misery please
5,3,1,Unfortunately, the hour is up, but I think your life is back on track.
4,0,0,I don't think this is what the boss meant when he told you to train me.
7,0,0,Tell me again why the test dummies need a vacation?
4,1,0,We're trying to be the first New Yorkers to get hit by every train. 3 down, 19 to go.
4,0,0,After all we've been through, you picked one hell of a way to get to the Bronx!
4,0,0,This is the ONLY way to get a free ride!
5,3,0,I hope we get seats together.
5,3,0,This is the only way your insurance will cover our sessions.
4,1,0,Then I figured, how much worse can it get?
6,0,0,Passed by as if we were not even here.
4,0,0,...and how does this make you feel?
4,0,0,Reruns? Do we have to stay?
7,0,2,Pre-existing conditions will not prevent us from winning a lawsuit. Or they won't prevent us from getting health insurance? Obama has made it all so complicated.
4,0,0,Ever since you read " My Year of Living Dangerously" I think you've proved your point but now you've gone off the rails.
4,1,0,OK ... one more time ... you hear a rumble and a screech of brakes ... and then what?
6,0,1,This is the last time we are riding economy class.
6,0,1,Hey, the D train is on time fore once. Go figure.
4,1,0,Usually it's a little girl telling me I can fly, but whatever.
4,0,0,I am committed to keeping your therapy on track.
4,0,0,I'm upping your fee to 5k an hour.
4,0,0,Let's start where we left off when the A-train hit us.
5,4,0,Do you ever feel like you're on the wrong track?
4,0,0,Dr. could we go back to just talking about insanity definitions?
4,1,0,Sometimes I feel like I keep setting myself up.
4,0,0,Alright Carl, second times a charm right...
4,1,0,Volunteers test new battleground casts
7,0,0,I promise the "D" train does not symbolize your mother.
6,1,1,Maybe this time it will finish the job
6,2,1,I told you I'd keep you on the right track no matter how painful it got.
4,0,0,They haven't worked out the details, but 'subwaycare' makes it easier for family and friends to reach you.
5,2,0,Sometimes I wish we had taken the buy out that the city offered.
4,0,0,You think there will be similar ADA accommodations at Coney Island?
4,0,0,D worst way to get Workman's Comp
5,0,0,Bill I think your phone is buzzing.
4,1,0,Here's to a speedy recovery.
4,0,0,I thought you said this tunnel was sealed off?
4,1,0,The doctor said we shouldn't move.
4,0,0,I had a dream that I voted for a democrat, and I woke up like this.
4,0,0,We should have moved when our legs worked.
4,0,0,Ejection seat test, batch 19...go!
4,0,0,Next time we'll be ready.
5,1,0,I feel like I'll never get my life back on track.
4,1,0,Maybe this one won't hit me as hard as my divorce.
4,0,0,It used to be more fun robbing trains
4,0,0,No doubt about it, healthcare is the third rail.
5,3,0,Management wants us to reenact it.
4,0,0,I thought you said third trail.
7,5,3,That's all the time we have.
5,3,1,Doc, confronting my fears every week doesn't seem to be working.
4,0,0,Now, as I was saying, before we were so rudely interrupted...
5,3,1,Any anxiety?
4,0,0,Psychoanalytic training.
4,0,0,Are you sure the D train only comes once on Sundays?
4,0,0,Yes. Now I'm beginning to feel your pain.
4,0,0,What are the odds of it happening again?
6,6,2,Sign my cast for good luck.
6,1,1,D train, boss, D train.
4,1,0,Maybe we should switch to the local.
4,0,0,The insurance agent said get comfortable, he would be right back with a check.
6,0,1,Ugh -- I think my health insurance only covers the A and C uptown trains.
4,0,0,Doc, I have just one leg to give.
3,1,0,Ok, already. I get it. You're a self- sabotager.
4,0,0,I've gotta say, the new "Happy Patient Virtual Reality Console" is very realistic, but they should really go in a different direction with the content.
7,0,0,how lucky that they had a first-aid kit on board!
4,0,0,Alright, let's try this again.
4,0,0,They call it anticipatory medicine.
5,1,0,Seems a lot less noisy than the last time.
4,0,0,We've gotta get out of this railroad apartment.
4,1,0,I thought that "third rail" thing was simply a figure of speech.......
4,1,0,What would James Bond do?
4,0,0,I’m not sure that getting back on track this soon is such a good idea.
4,0,0,Now do you appreciate the time constraints of our sessions?
4,1,0,…and in sharing your fears, they begin to lose their power.
4,0,0,Just another day on the job.
5,3,1,It appears our time is up.
6,5,3,Looks like our time is up.
4,1,0,Maybe we should have taken the "B" train?
4,0,0,New York's bad infrastructure is really affecting my quality of death
4,1,0,Don't you think it's time we gave up train spotting.
5,0,0,Do you believe in premonitions?
4,0,0,Home Alone 6 \0/
4,0,0,Bum wheel?
5,1,0,I know healthcare is free now, but is it too soon after our picnic on the runway? I wouldn't want to abuse the system...
4,0,0,It's the only office I could afford the rent on.
6,1,1,I think I finally know what the "D" stands for.
4,0,0,Enough about me. What made you go into breakdancing?
6,0,0,There may be some lingering resentment....
4,1,0,Third time's a charm, right?
4,0,0,Looks like we have this trip all wrapped up!
6,1,1,Last time was a fluke; this time my calculations are foolproof.
4,1,0,Its like i said, Frank. 'Lay down on the couch and I'll show you my big D.
4,0,0,At least we escaped the bus!
4,0,0,Yeah, I can't take the constant pain either.
4,0,0,Is this what the lawyer meant - when he said "we would own" the railroad?
5,1,0,We shouldn't have complained. Maybe the waiting area is now too close to the train!
5,2,0,Where'd we get off track, Frank?
5,0,0,Next time don't take it literally.
4,0,0,To ensure safety over track conditions ahead, this subway train will operate slower than normal for a short time.
4,5,0,If only this itching would stop.
4,0,0,Don't worry, i'm trained for this.
4,0,0,Well you're certainly on track to recovery.
4,1,0,What are the odds of this happening twice, right?
4,0,0,D is for Deadline.
4,1,0,I told you--we both get hurt when there's transference.
4,0,0,If this doesn't work, I'll kill myself.
4,0,0,Nice of them to stop for us now how do we call room Service?
7,0,2,I don't think it's healthy involving me in your insurance scam fantasies.
4,0,0,Busking on the tracks isn't as lucrative as it used to be back in the old days...
6,0,1,So in this dream, you're lying on the tracks as a train barrels towards you?
4,0,0,This beats being harassed by the cops on the platform.
5,2,0,Oh yeah - the third rail. Now that'll kill you.
6,2,1,As I said yesterday, to most people "wait 'behind' the yellow line" is not ambiguous.
4,0,0,Ever hear the one about putting the cart before the horse?
6,1,1,It would be more convincing if it had all its wheels.
4,0,0,I told you we should have stolen the Barbie Jeep!
4,0,0,Shouldn't we just buy a ticket?
5,3,0,These fare hikes really do cost an arm and a leg.
3,0,0,Sorry, my train of thought is just all over the place.
4,1,0,Are you absolutely sure eminent domain works like this?
4,1,0,D Train! D Train!
4,0,0,Did I mention this session is free of charge?
4,0,0,Isn't this a permanent solution to a temporary condition?
4,0,0,Next week let's try returning to your comfort zone.
5,2,0,You still think we're on the right track?
4,1,0,I know our last session was traumatic, but I think we're on the right track this time.
4,0,0,This time are you sure it's virtual reality?
4,0,0,Just like clockwork...
4,0,0,Interesting. And why do you think you'd feel safer next time on the side without wheels?
5,2,0,This is a handicap sitting zone.
5,3,1,All right, full disclosure: I'm not really a psychiatrist.
4,0,0,I always get the drafty room
6,0,1,This time, remember to record.
5,0,0,We'll give aversion therapy one last try.
4,0,0,We've been watching too many Disney movies.
4,1,0,I forwarded my mail to your house.
6,0,1,This should make us more symmetrical.
4,0,0,We were supposed to be in the hospital.
5,4,0,'Comfortable' I'll give them, but 'Accessible'?
3,0,0,We fell off a train together, and then fell in love! Happy Anniversary, Frank!
4,1,0,...and this is a recurring dream?
5,3,0,Never give in to a bully.
5,4,1,Maybe your fear of trains isn't completely irrational.
5,4,0,I guess you're right. Your life is a train wreck.
4,1,0,If he backs up, our health care insurance carrier will drop us for sure.
5,0,0,Do you ever feel your life is more important than your squished penny collection?
5,1,0,The root cause of your feelings of impending doom are becoming more clear with each of our sessions.
4,0,0,So much for the train being on time for a change.
4,0,0,I'm skeptical.
5,2,0,I just can't decide if the insurance payout was worth the trouble.
4,0,0,Run over me with a bus? I will watch a train run over you.
4,1,0,Been feeling rundown as usual, doc.
6,0,1,Are you sure that was an R&R sign?
4,0,0,I guess there are no more cabooses.
6,1,1,I'm telling you, the C train never comes down this track.
7,1,1,Let's try to pin down what's causing you anxiety.
5,2,0,Like I said last time, it's all an illusion.
4,0,0,I told you this was better than acupuncture. Nothing takes your mind off your woes like an incoming train.
6,0,0,Well Randy, it appears that we are the definition of insanity.
4,0,0,I should have read my contract closer before I took this job.
5,0,0,How to murder handicaps with a train while they're sitting or laying on something.
5,3,0,I think one more session should cure your fear of subway trains.
4,0,0,Do you think we are getting too old for this kind of demonstration?
4,1,0,Are you sure we're on the right track?
4,1,0,Just don't touch the third rail.
6,0,0,According to the manual, and where I think we may have gone wrong in the past, is that we were supposed to move 10 minutes ago.
5,0,0,You sure Doc offered a discount on new casts?
4,0,0,Why was this a good idea?
5,0,0,I think it's Tuesday.
4,1,0,I'm going for full retirement - last time the jury only awarded me half million dollars.
5,0,0,I know you said you wanted to live close to transit, but I think this is a tad too close.
4,0,0,So you see, reality therapy has demonstrated that your fear of subways is not irrational after all.
4,1,0,I just feel like I'm on the wrong track.
4,1,0,She self-identifies as a monorail.
6,1,1,My boss says I need to get on track.
4,0,0,Harry, we've been over this before, past is just prologue.
4,0,0,I think we've been left in the lurch.
8,0,1,Shoot, we missed our train once again.
4,0,0,Have you seen my ottoman?
5,0,0,I think we should find better places to eat our lunches.
5,4,0,I think this session will finally give me closure
3,0,0,Book a room near transportation, you said.
4,0,0,To be fair, it is a neighborhood in transition.
5,1,0,In the early days, Sigmund would repeatedly go to very great lengths when working a cure for newly defined phobias.
4,1,0,Did you check to see if our policy excludes preexisting conditions?
4,0,0,Let's go again whats of a little of gauge.
4,1,0,Yes, I'm sure these sessions will deal with your phobia.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, your hour is up again.
4,0,0,Sugarcoat it all you want. This is one tough neighborhood.
4,0,0,Remember when you thought not touching the third rail would be our biggest problem?
5,3,0,What sold me on this place is how conviemt it is to public transit.
4,0,0,How can I open up? I still don't feel comfortable in your office.
4,1,0,Is that the front or the back.
4,0,0,Funny thing, I never even saw it coming!
5,2,0,Ghandi would have loved us.
6,1,2,I'm beginning to think this cartoonist doesn't like us.
6,0,1,I refuse to believe that a New York train is on time.
4,0,0,If you hadn't thrown away the propeller, we could have just sued the airline company.
6,0,0,Um, The Doors . .
4,0,0,So how's training going?
4,0,0,Maybe we should take the A-train.
4,0,0,Perhaps this is why you keep getting hurt.
4,1,0,These casts really are indestructible!
4,0,0,So this is New York's version of that Oergon law?
5,0,0,We still gonna lounge on the E train tracks tomorrow?
6,5,2,Uh oh, looks like we're running over again.
4,0,0,I meant transference, not train interference.
4,0,0,They tried to make me go to rehab. I said "No, no, no."
4,0,0,Look! Our train is finally here to pick us up.
6,1,1,Oh, how I long for a transit strike.
6,0,1,Your accident proneness is getting contagious
4,1,0,How is this train staying upright on only one rail and with wheels only on one side?
4,0,0,More like D for "death," am I right?!
4,1,0,I think it's safe to say that we both a break though.
4,0,0,This is absolutely the last time I'm doing any dares from Eddie.
4,5,0,What makes you think your mother is driving the train?
4,0,0,Maybe now our lawyer can get them to increase their final offer.
4,0,0,Stop complaining about our train leaving the station.
4,1,0,No, you're not insane because you're expecting it to be a little different this time.
4,0,0,Just like with the fear of falling of a cliff, we will deal with the fear of being run over by a train in the same way
4,0,0,Another couple of sessions and you'll hardly remember the war.
5,3,0,I guarantee this time will be different
4,1,0,The bnb's owner asked me to mention his proximity to local transportation in my review!
4,1,0,Ever feel like your life has come off the rails?
4,1,0,I'm just trying to make meaning from experience.
4,1,0,Not to worry sweetheart, our insurance covers pre-existing conditions.
4,0,0,This time it has to work!
4,1,0,"Hows your day going"?
4,0,0,The voices in my head are screaming ' Here comes that train again ! '
5,2,0,If this doesn't work, we'll try poison.
4,1,0,You are sure we have reached the annual maximum out-of-pocket insurance co-payments?
4,4,1,Not to brag, but I was a runner up for a Darwin Award last year.
6,1,2,Take your time-you're my last patient of the day.
4,1,0,We should be able to retire after this one.
5,0,0,Where'd the TV go?
4,0,0,You said your great-grandfather was John Henry?
6,0,1,Next time we Uber, ok?
5,3,0,If this doesn't go viral, I give up.
4,1,0,This is not what I meant by alfresco dining
4,0,0,My watch is on the fritz. Is it late again!?
4,0,0,They say someone gets run over in New York every 23 minutes.
6,2,1,Don't worry. Everything's already broken.
4,1,0,Rest before the D train, they said.
4,0,0,It's called therapy: I'm replacing your unreasonable fear of trains with a very reasonable fear of trains.
6,2,1,I'm not sure our course of treatment is on the right track.
4,0,0,That's it! I'm going back to hypnosis school.
5,2,0,Where do you see yourself in all this?
4,0,0,Overcrowding isn't causing this delay.
4,0,0,Didn't we already hit the D Train last week? Transit Police may get suspicious.
4,1,0,You'll have to speak up.
4,1,0,Whatever you do, don't touch the third rail.
4,0,0,Dis is da life, huh!
5,2,0,I wasn't into rehab either.
4,0,0,Relax—we'll be at Grand Street in ten flat.
4,0,0,I told you to stay out of the bar car!
5,2,0,This should satisfy the deductible.
4,1,0,Only eight more times until Cats is off Broadway
6,3,1,Should we call the book "Bad Breaks" or "Bad Brakes?"
5,2,0,Looks like we will have to pick it up from here in let's say 8 weeks.
6,2,1,Sometimes I just feel like we're on the wrong track.
4,0,0,I don't get it. Why would the insurance company have us wait here?
6,0,0,Do not let your foot hit the 3rd rail!
4,0,0,This idea of your's might get traction yet.
5,1,0,Like I said the last time--As long as we don't touch the third rail, we should be good.
4,1,0,With our HMO we should have paid for the private room.
4,1,0,Your therapy is right on track.
5,1,0,I don't care how crude he is or who he insults: He says he'll keep the trains running on time.
4,0,0,Two polar bears were on an iceberg. One turned on the radio, the other fell off.
4,0,0,Challenging yourself can be highly therapeutic.
4,0,0,I told you we should have waited for the express.
4,1,0,Sometimes I just feel I'm on the wrong track...
4,1,0,Like they say: 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try again'
4,0,0,Something tells me we're on the wrong track once again.
4,0,0,For our next session, I suggest we confront that issue head on instead.
4,0,0,I said get on track or you're headed for a tran wreck, but I clearly said don't involve me.
4,1,0,This is the first time you mentioned your father...
4,0,0,Wait, aren't we supposed to fake the injury after we wait in front of the train?
4,0,0,We finally got our lives back on track .
4,0,0,No one said gentrification was easy.
4,1,0,Do you think the Union Lawyers will believe us?
4,1,0,My disability has almost run out.
4,0,0,Would you rather be in the nose bleed section?
4,0,0,Perhaps skydiving is a better extreme sport.
4,0,0,1) No George, I don't expect we'll "D"rail it. 2) Henry, I swear this is my last test of your automatic braking system.
4,1,0,This is not what I had in mind when I said "I share your pain".
6,2,1,Mark my words, we will conquer your fear of trains.
4,0,0,...and yet, I believe there's more to this shared destructive ideation than meets the eye...
4,0,0,It was wise of you to buy us the extra legroom.
9,0,0,It's been so much more convenient since Uber converted to driverless vehicles...
4,0,0,Well that just D-alined my bones
4,0,0,The L is hell.
5,3,0,Looks like we're running a bit late again ....
5,0,0,Ready? Maybe we'll get luckier this time.
4,0,0,I think we should go back to Avoidance Therapy Mr. Spangler
4,1,0,Certainly, but dig deeper. This fear of trains comes from something that happened during your childhood.
4,0,0,The ad said reasonable rent and close to public transportation.
4,0,0,It's immersion therapy. No risk, no gain.
6,2,1,I'm afraid we're out of time for today.
6,2,1,I cannot tell if the train is coming or going
4,0,0,You'll get used to the noise.
3,0,0,D train D train the train is coming.
4,0,0,It's a new method I read about.
6,0,1,I'm thinking this time is not going to be better!
4,1,0,Same time next week?
5,3,0,You'll be fine. We're nowhere near the third rail.
4,0,0,Sometimes I feel like my train has left the station.
5,0,0,Your decision to continue with our sessions has led me to conclude that we are both mentally unstable.
4,0,0,We're here to get the trains back on track.
4,1,0,It was a hell of a ride.
4,1,0,Exposure therapy takes time. But perhaps we should have started with your social anxieties.
4,1,0," That railroad pension plan isn't as good as I had hope it would be".
4,0,0,It's true. Electromagnetic forces mend bones.
6,2,1,That's our time.
4,1,0,It's like waiting for the Republican presidential nominee to be announced
4,0,0,I find that staycations have an element of adventure, too.
4,0,0,You know I can't help but feel the concept of position, position, position is entirely risk free...
6,1,2,'The subways are much safer than they used to be.'
4,0,0,Do you ever feel like you've reached the end of the line?
4,1,0,I kept telling you: See something say something!
4,0,0,As your therapist, I want to feel your pain, but we may have crossed some boundaries here.
4,0,0,Mind the third rail, dear.
4,0,0,So you also think quality control's an iffy career path.
4,1,0,It’s just one damn train after another.
3,0,0,Same here--haven't got the sense I was born with.
4,0,0,Next time, let's just call in sick.
4,1,0,The D train is late today.
4,0,0,I know she has a tendency to roll-over you, but lets see if we can get this relationship back on track.
6,0,1,I feel a breakthrough coming.
4,1,0,Sorry, you were saying about the accident? I momentarily lost your train of thought...
6,0,0,I hear that "Sick Passenger" is a leading cause of train delays.
4,0,0,So let me get this straight... The train is Medicare, we're Medicaid and the third rail is Social Security? Oh, right, the third rail is under your foot. Now I see.
4,1,0,I really feel they need to be clearer about what they mean by a 'training analysis.'
4,1,0,'Get right back on that horse' sounded good at the time!
5,2,0,I think this is our stop
5,2,0,Oh, great, it's the local.
6,0,1,Might as well add "flat" to "broke."
7,2,3,Same time next week, but maybe a different location?
4,0,0,So that's what was causing all the rumbling.
6,4,2,Well, it looks like our time is up.
4,1,0,I don't think it's so much the bandages, our our proximity to the trains, I just don't think we're catching the kind of rays in here we had expected.
4,1,0,This time we get it right!
5,0,0,I hate to say 'I told you so,' but you just had to vote for a candidate who promised to cut Medicare.
4,0,0,Wouldn't it just be easier to touch the third rail?
4,1,0,I don't think this is what doc meant by traction.
4,0,0,I blame Obamacare!
5,1,0,This last time will conclude your desensitization treatment, your fear of trains will finally be gone.
4,0,0,Dr. Leventhal recommended I get direct exposure to 'D' to stay on track.
4,1,0,At least we gave as good as we got.
4,1,0,Time's up. Now if you excuse me I have another patient waiting on track 9.
5,2,0,Are you sure you signed up for Obamacare?
4,1,0,Our other clinic is in Monument Valley
4,0,0,the new armchair traveling
6,1,0,We got it made this time. NO train can go backwards.
4,0,0,I put all my chips on this one.
4,0,0,You idiot! I said I wanted to go TO Subway!
6,0,1,'The lower cost of underground psychotherapy is a result of increased risk."
7,0,2,Let’s explore why you always feel run over.
4,0,0,Don't give up; I feel we're on the right track this time.
4,1,0,Try to relax... another train should be coming through soon.
4,0,0,I did not see that coming...the "D" train on the IRT tracks!
6,2,2,But, you know how it ends.
4,0,0,I'm thinking of that Dylan song, Raymond, about the all-night girls on the D train; "We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight/Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane"? Look at us. Clearly, it's not him.
4,1,0,I'm beginning to question the wisdom of LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION
6,1,1,I believe the D train is a bit early today......
4,1,0,We'll be downtown in no time.
4,0,0,Looks like we guessed wrong - again.
4,0,0,I'm not sure about this Obamacare outpatient treatment...
4,0,0,Failure of the euthanasia activists makes life harder.
4,0,0,Maybe this time we'll get it right.
4,1,0,Tell me again--how this will make us rich.
4,0,0,This reminds me of a dream I had last night.
4,0,0,Great session, Bob. But unfortunately, our time is up.
7,2,2,Third time's a charm, right Phil?
4,0,0,You wait till now to tell me their liability insurance is capped?
6,1,1,We will be on Easy Street...no really that's the next stop.
6,1,2,So, what's bothering you?
4,1,0,I call it 'extreme rebirthing.'
4,0,0,I was hoping for something with a little more pizzazz. You know, like an A train.
4,0,0,Yes, well, terrorists are much more likely there than here, Dudley.
7,3,1,On the bright side, I never saved for retirement.
4,0,0,They said the room was available.....and close to public transportation.
4,0,0,Next time let's use my nightmare, OK?
4,0,0,What made you think this would be an extension of the High Line?
4,0,0,So amped to be dead I straight up hate my life lol.
4,0,0,Where's our parking placard?
4,1,0,So in this dream did it hurt when the train hit you?
4,0,0,Oh snap, here comes the 5:08 to Pelham again!
4,0,0,This is the last time you talk me into a staycation.
4,0,0,Yup, life is good; we can't even jump on the 'D' train.
4,0,0,Does that D stand for doomed ?
4,0,0,Can we switch next session to the B Train?
5,4,1,And then it hit me.
6,0,1,No, I don't know the definition of insanity. Why do you ask?
4,0,0,You're sure this scene is meant to be ironic, right?
4,1,0,In these times of uncertainty, I find the inevitability of a moving train to be oddly reassuring.
3,1,0,We could use a transfer.
5,0,0,At some point, we're going to have to move on from the formative influence of "Stand by Me."
4,0,0,Accessible ! Why do you think the Dodgers left.
5,1,0,We have to find a safer hobby than Trainsquatting.
4,0,0,We should probably call off this experiment.
4,0,0,Most people really can't comprehend what it means 'to be thrown under the train.'
5,0,0,Oh! Cherish this crushing, D trains are rare!
6,1,2,Well, at least we're back on track.
5,3,1,I guess the good news is that we meet the deductible.
4,0,0,Now do you understand the difference between "furnished sublet" and "furnished subway let?"
4,1,0,I definitely thought they said brains.
7,1,2,Well, it didn't work the first time.
4,0,0,This is a step up from our usual slip-and-fall scam.
5,0,0,I'll think twice before the next time I compliment someone's caboose.
4,0,0,I'm voting for Trump.
4,0,0,Let's see if Obamacare will pay for this one.
5,4,0,Your metaphors for life are deeply disturbing and remarkably painful.
4,1,0,...just one more leg to go!
3,0,0,Once the train passes, pretend you're hurt.
4,0,0,Maybe we should go back to being Batman and Robin
4,0,0,I love the smell of diesel in the morning.
4,0,0,Okay, suit yourself. We DON'T need faster download speeds.
4,0,0,The D train "X" Games 2016
4,0,0,Let me start off today's session by stating that as a result of your desensitization therapy I'm now more afraid of psychiatrists than trains.
5,1,0,I can't shake this feeling of dread, again.
5,2,0,once again, David Brooks wrote a column that many people thought was insufferably smug!
6,1,1,Handicapped Parking Only
4,1,0,My father always said you came from the wrong side of the tracks.
6,3,1,I'm beginning to think reliving your accident is doing more harm than good...
3,0,0,They say never touch the third rail
4,0,0,I guess the 'D' doesn't stand for dead.
4,1,0,Still doubt the power of positive thinking?
5,3,0,Two more incidents and that week in Jamaica is ours!
4,0,0,You know, comparatively speaking, Obamacare really wasn’t that bad.
4,0,0,Theses train fares cost an arm and a leg!
7,3,3,I don't like the new waiting room here at the VA.
4,0,0,And then they give you an aspirin and bill your insurance company for six CAT scans.
6,7,2,That last session was painful, but try to focus on the light at the end of the tunnel.
4,0,0,And we shall continue this therapy until you break through your fear of trains!
7,2,0,Are you sure that's the back of the train?
4,1,0,Time to stop blaming others for problems.
6,1,1,Don't touch that third rail, Bill. They say it electrocutes you.
5,2,0,I've fixed the brake this time.
4,1,0,I hope Obama Care covers train wrecks.
4,0,0,When does the damn local come?
5,2,0,What were we thinking hanging out *in front of* the train before?
6,2,1,My last therapist refused to help me face my fears.
4,1,0,My staycation has it all: saving money, beating crowds, avoiding sun exposure.
4,1,0,"This is the best hospital, isn't it Larry?" (by Frances Bell, age 6)
4,0,0,You are so right, my friend. Sure is hard to get off the beaten track in New York City.
4,0,0,I'm not so sure I want my life back on track.
4,0,0,is she smiling on us?
5,1,0,You can relax this time, Phil. Sometimes the end of dline is just the end of dline.
4,0,0,Law school just paid for itself.
6,2,1,I'm so glad our recovery is back on track.
6,2,1,Well, that's about it for this week.
4,0,0,Be careful not to touch the third rail-- It's electrified.
4,0,0,They think they might have worked out the bugs in the brakes.
3,3,0,After overcoming your fear of heights, we'll now work on your fear of subways.
4,0,0,I thought deja vu all over again was supposed to be funny.
5,3,1,I feel safer here than at a Donald Trump rally.
4,0,0,Larry? Um...I don't think the D Train stops here either.
4,1,0,I never knew train-spotting in a city would be such a dangerous hobby.
5,0,0,Now that we’ve gotten you over your fear of heights, let’s tackle your fear of subways.
5,2,0,I've never known a conductor to come down so hard on passing gas in the car.
4,0,0,So, in your dream you have us sitting on a subway track with the 7:14 express headed our way. I can't be sure, but I interpret the dream as a dramatic, yet relevant expression of your fears concerning your last check bouncing."
4,0,0,This psychotic illusion you're describing is obviously a manifestation of your Trumphobia.
4,1,0,We should have tried this the first time.
4,0,0,God ? ...or no God?
4,1,0,It's better to get hit with it all at once.
4,0,0,Its "D"train boss, its "D"train!!
4,0,0,I wonder if it will hurt as much this time aorund.
6,2,2,Let's discuss the idea that repeating the same behavior and expecting a different outcome is insanity.
4,0,0,'Abandoned Tunnel Inspection Team'
4,1,0,There has to be an easier way to make a living other that suing the subway company for pain and suffering.
6,1,1,Sometimes, Tom, a train really is just a train.
4,0,0,Really? Must they do that right here?
6,2,1,At least they didn't throw us under the bus.
4,0,0,A $100 co-pay for Fentanyl! Did you hear Part D's gone mobile--You don't say?
3,0,0,It's deja vu time. Let the fear abate and the healing begin.
5,2,0,Well jumping off a roof didn't work.
4,1,0,It's on time, but shouldn't we be on the platform?
4,1,0,I feel like we're finally getting back on track...
5,0,0,Believe me, death is cheaper.
6,0,1,No, I just attribute it to bad luck.
5,2,0,How do we know this isn't Virtual Reality?
4,1,0,They always return to the scene of the crime.
4,1,0,I still believe it: what doesn't kill you ...
4,1,0,I don't care if it is rent controlled, its' time to move.
4,0,0,Still think the Low Line is the next High Line?
6,2,1,yes it seems dangerous but statistically the likely hood of being hit by a train twice is zero
4,0,0,I thought you said we would have time to recuperate!
4,0,0,I tell ya we grew up on the wrong side of the tracks.
6,2,1,I feel my research on behavioral re-enactment therapy is coming to an end.
6,2,1,I thought you said this was the end of the line.
4,0,0,How much worse can the 'wrong side of the tracks' actually be?
5,2,0,I see we are running over on our time, again.
4,1,0,3 down 99,997 to go.
4,0,0,I can't even imagine what would have happened on the 'F' train.
5,3,0,If at first you don't succumb,try, try again.
4,1,0,See - it can't be real if it doesn't have wheels in both sides.
4,1,0,Lightning doesn't strike twice, huh?
4,0,0,We have to move or lower our co-pays and deductibles!
4,0,0,I'd rather it be this D-train than Trump's.
5,0,0,You dared us to terminate...Now, let's try again.
4,0,0,Something tells me Congress just voted on that bill extending MedEvac funding.
4,0,0,If this doesn't cure you of your fear of trains, I don't know what will.
4,1,0,Why does the D train hurt more than the others?
4,0,0,Hey Bernie, put it on the tab!
5,8,2,Well, looks like we're all out of time for today.
5,2,0,It looks like we are having difficulty getting on the right track.
6,2,1,So, are you still against Ride Share ?
4,0,0,This wasn't the breakthrough I had in mind.
4,1,0,Aren't you happy? This way we save the airfare to Oregon.
5,2,0,Well, time is up for our session. I think we've made a real breakthrough with your phobia!
4,0,0,Getting the most out of universal healthcare.
4,0,0,Go ahead and shoot, we're all carrying cap guns.
4,1,0,We're on the right track for a workman's comp settlement.
6,0,0,Look Doc, I DO want to face my fears, but when I spoke of the light at the end of the tunnel, this is not what I meant.
4,0,0,I'm beginning to wonder if your sense of foreboding is more than mere resistance to my ground-breaking therapy.
6,0,1,Tell all the boys on 42nd Street that I will soon be there !
6,2,1,At least we don't have to worry about getting a seat.
4,1,0,We're just a couple of guys with some LOCO motives.
5,0,0,So, what you were saying? Something about the randomness and unfairness of the universe, wasn't it?
5,3,0,What if I were to say there is no such thing as an accident?
4,0,0,can't always assume it's going the other way
4,0,0,At least the A train blew the whistle and put on the brakes
4,0,0,I am pretty pumped to make the 'playing chicken' final, but must admit that the wear and tear is getting to me
4,0,0,I think I'd like to get a second opinion on this 'Impact Therapy'...
5,1,0,Excuse me, but where do you think you're going?
4,0,0,From the schedule I still can't tell if the D train is going north or south?
4,1,0,We'll be safe here, if the train goes any further it goes into the washing station.
6,1,1,I believe the term is 'to miss the boat' actually
5,3,0,The little engine that did.
4,0,0,I know we should move; that's all you ever talk about. You have a one track mind.
4,0,0,Eminent Domain. Learn to live with it.
7,0,2,That which does not kill us, makes us stronger.
4,1,0,I'm pretty sure they said the MTA have the best coverage
7,0,0,I am positive that I said that I wanted the "D" train; not that I wanted to be detrained!
4,0,0,Now THIS therapy should do the trick!
3,0,0,Maybe giving Dinah that banjo was a mistake. Why, she hasn't blown her horn in MONTHS!
5,0,0,I don't know why, but ever since our accident I feel like my life is about to go off the rails.
4,0,0,Our recovery is right on track now.
4,0,0,Dont worry. We know breaks.
4,0,0,I prefer F train.
4,0,0,Remember what happened last time we sat out here?
3,0,0,Do you find the near miss less exhilarating than it once was?
4,0,0,To take or to catch a train?
5,1,0,I'm not sure I should continue accepting your ideas for safe places to meet.
4,0,0,When he backs up, you scream real loud and I'll call the lawyer.
4,0,0,This isn't going to work. It was the A train in my dream.
4,0,0,You say you had concerns continuing after our first session. Let's explore that.
4,0,0,When's the last time this train got anywhere so fast?
4,1,0,Sooner or later we need to find Zoe!
6,1,1,Perhaps we should reschedule?
6,0,1,I think our hour is up. Same time next week ?
6,2,2,I think we need to address your death wish first and maybe work on the train fetish later.
4,0,0,I'm telling you...The NTSB said that all he had was a poppy seed bagel.
4,1,0,Oh Crap! Not again.
4,1,0,You know, it didn't stop the first time...
4,0,0,I don't think I like this the new Medicare Part D prescription plan.
4,0,0,"This may not hurt as much as you think it will".
6,0,1,The train missed us!
4,0,0,Don't worry, we're in the handicapped spot.
4,1,0,I wonder what the D stands for?
5,1,0,What's the worst that can happen?
5,2,0,You know, Harvey, I've always loved your proactive spirit.
4,0,0,The lawyer called about our eminent domain appeal
4,0,0,Wow, the cow-catcher does make a difference!
4,1,0,They said physical therapy might hurt.
6,1,1,Be careful when you get up...that third rail is electrified.
4,0,0,So you feel like you've been hit by a train. Tell me more...
5,3,0,Somehow, I feel like an accident just waiting to happen.
4,0,0,Good thing psychiatrists a required to be M.D.s.
4,1,0,If I'm still afraid of trains after this session I'm asking for my money back.
5,0,1,Finally!
5,1,0,Barry, It's cheaper than amputation by a surgeon.
7,0,2,I spy with my little eye something beginning with D.
4,0,0,A little late, but our analyst's advice of confronting last month's traumatic experience should be reconsidered.
4,0,0,Stunt work is all it's cracked up to be.
6,2,1,Even the wrong side of the tracks would be better than this.
5,0,0,Where's Fearless Fosdick when you need him?
4,0,0,So, this too is your mother's fault.
4,0,0,We'll damn well get it right this time!
4,0,0,"I always said you'd do anything for the D".
6,1,1,NOW do you believe that realtor saying?
6,2,1,Don't worry. It's like Trump's becoming president, it can't happen.
5,3,2,I think we're on the verge of a breakthrough.
4,0,0,Maybe this isn't what the doctor meant when he said to try to get back on track
6,0,1,In hindsight, I don't think it would have worked even if the trains did run on time.
4,0,0,If we survive this one, we get into the Guiness Book of Records.
6,1,1,Sticks and stones will break my bones but trains will never hurt me.
4,0,0,SOMETIMES LESS IS NOT MORE.
4,0,0,Tom, you really put the D in analysand
4,1,0,Our new vacation policy really hurts.
4,1,0,Batman to Superman: It's showtime now.
4,0,0,Like I've said, don't worry...we have a easement.
4,0,0,I know taking the plane is faster, but how can you beat this leg room?
4,0,0,Your the one that got his arm caught in the emergency stop, not me!
3,1,0,If it backs over us we can sue for double!
7,0,1,I miss the old days. Carrying signs. Maybe throwing a rock or two.
5,3,0,It might be the meds, but I just had déjà vu
4,0,0,Don't worry, they're just testing the whistle on this one.
4,1,0,You're right, this is way better than taking the F.
6,0,1,If we can make it here, we can make it anywhere.
6,1,2,Don't worry, pre-existing conditions are covered.
5,3,0,Stick us in front of a fast moving train once –well shame on them! Stick us here twice….
4,0,0,. . . HR said the company had a new fast-track accident recovery plan . . .
4,0,0,Rail riding used to be free and easy - now, it costs an arm and a leg!
4,0,0,I'll ask you one more time. Two plus two equals...?
7,0,0,It does halfway work but these other consequences are a pain.
4,0,0,Do you feel a breeze
4,1,0,In this job market even an unpaid internship makes sense.
4,0,0,Preoccupy yourself enough to relax.
4,1,0,Facing fears is important.
7,0,1,Do you smell urine?
4,1,0,I'm starting to question our physical therapist's tactics.
5,3,0,They say the third time's the charm.
4,0,0,At least we'll have coverage in prison.
6,0,1,I'm not so sure about this trackupucture
4,0,0,Thought you said the worst was over
6,0,1,?? "Pardon me, boy, is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?" ??
4,1,0,I think we've made some great breakthroughs today. Unfortunately, we are out of time.
4,0,0,I told you the D was running this weekend
4,1,0,I told the ambulance driver that I won't be able to train for a while! I'm not sure he understood!
4,1,0,My pain management doctor says I'm on the right track to recovery.
4,0,0,I heard the new R-211's will have digital video screens.
4,1,0,There's nothing to worry about. This train's never on time.
4,0,0,I hope this is a flashback and if not that there is no reverse on his gearbox.
4,0,0,All this medical care is free now. So happy!
4,1,0,The 5:24 is right on time--unfortunately.
5,3,0,Whoops, looks like our session ran a little long again.
4,0,0,before I get off track, let me tell you how I broke my arm...
5,2,0,Exposure therapy is not for everyone.
4,1,0,Last time I took the A-train and all I got was this lousy cast.
5,2,0,You sure this is the new underground railroad to Canada's free healthcare?
4,0,0,Aah, the breeze on-rush!.. something to die for.
4,1,0,Remember the last time we tried to flag down the D train?
7,2,3,Time's almost up.
4,0,0,You really feel the action in these seats.
4,0,0,I thought you said this was the B line.
5,4,0,When I said 'we were going to catch the train,' I didn't think you would take me literally!
5,0,0,Are you sure this is what the doctor meant when he said we should be on track for a full recovery?
3,0,0,If "D" stands for "Decisive Death"...why is there only one....
4,0,0,This might derail our recuperation.
4,0,0,But Obamacare covers it, right?
4,0,0,AT LEAST, THEY COULD HAVE MOVED US TO THE PLATFORM!
4,0,0,I told you not to get the cheap sleeper.
6,1,1,I hope like hell they get the lighting right on this take.
4,0,0,Pulling Tolstoy with class.
4,0,0,Talk about Paris! They have just announced another strike on line D of the RER!
4,0,0,"Boy, our last session was a train wreck!. I think we're on the right track now".
5,1,0,The ad said, "open layout and close to the train."
3,1,0,One can only hope that the second time around will be more successful
4,0,0,Are you SURE this is the High Line park?
4,0,0,You're right, the commute is shorter but it can be hard to sleep in.
7,2,0,Don't get too comfortable.
4,0,0,Come to think of it, I misspoke. It was the L Train.
4,0,0,How does the prospect of imminent death make you feel?
6,1,1,What the hell? Yeah, I'll give you a refund if this doesn't work!
4,0,0,Another figment of my imagination, doc?
5,0,0,Two more sessions should rid you of your Siderodromophobia.
4,0,0,Oh, look it's Dee Train!
4,1,0,It's transference not transference
4,0,0,This is still better than being in there.
4,1,0,Do you still want a second opinion?
5,3,0,"Convenient to public transportation", my foot...
7,4,4,Well, I see we're about out of time.
4,0,0,This would have been much faster in Oregon.
4,1,0,Being an immigrant sucks
4,0,0,If at first you don't succeed, try, try, TRY AGAINNNNNNN...
4,0,0,Why do we always miss the D-train?
4,0,0,Here's hoping we'll miss the next one.
4,0,0,This is just the copy under Pres. Trump's Unavoidable Care Act.
4,0,0,This rehab center may not look like much, but I couldn't find a single bad review!
4,1,0,This is D end....
4,1,0,I told you we should of used Uber to go to the clinic.
4,0,0,Hey, technically, it's still a Park Avenue address.
4,1,0,As long as the “lightning only strikes once” idea holds, we should be ok.
4,0,0,Can we talk about something else, I think we're on the wrong track?
5,3,0,As I've said, whatever doesn't kill us will make us stronger.
6,1,1,It's still better than the bus station.
4,1,0,I know this is painful for you, but it is nothing compared to Manhattan Office rental rates.
4,0,0,We won't protest this time.
4,0,0,In hindsight we could have found a better way to protest the line getting shut down.
4,0,0,It wasn't going to be on time anyway
5,0,0,I’m beginning to think we’re two tokes over the line.
7,0,1,Family as primary care givers is not a good plan.
5,0,0,We have more to worry about than being politically correct!
4,1,0,My doctorate is from Harvard but I'm training in New York.
4,0,0,An obscure reference and a snarky comment-but the quotation marks make it funny; it's the quotation marks.
4,0,0,"No Smoking means No Smoking ANYWHERE!
4,0,0,This better work
4,0,0,Stop worrying about the future
6,0,1,It's the new way of testing operators' response time.
5,0,0,It's the express mate. We should arrive at Yankee Stadium for the home opener.
4,1,0,See you on the other side of the tracks.
6,2,2,Fool me once, shame on you.
3,1,0,This commute is killing me.
4,0,0,Did you have to choose the side with wheels?
5,0,0,Now do you understand why they call it the crazy train?
4,0,0,I hear there are delays on the A at Canal.
5,2,0,D-Day, Part Two.
4,1,0,I'm afraid our time is almost up.
5,2,0,I've always preferred light rail.
4,0,0,What we really need to do is look back at your childhood to discover the source of all your pain.
4,0,0,You didn't invest in Uber either?
6,1,2,Ok, I get how TrumpCare works in New York, but what about States without a subway system?
5,2,0,Next time just *tell* me about your dream.
4,0,0,So I says to Bob, I says, "I've already survived a plane crash, a motorcycle wipeout and a house fire. How much worse could things get?"
4,0,0,Sit and relax you said. Ollie, here's another fine mess you've gotten me into!
4,0,0,Actually, the wrong side of the tracks isn't anything at all what I was expecting.
4,0,0,You got The Cyclone and Wonder Wheel--now that's worth every penny of the fare!
5,3,0,I just can't shake this feeling of impending doom.
4,0,0,I don't know about you, but I think this is taking "hair of the dog" a bit too far.
4,0,0,Don't worry, lightning never strikes . . .
5,3,0,Just one more hit should get us above our deductible.
5,2,0,Trains are my hobby
4,0,0,It's not therapy without exposure, Tom.
4,0,0,We must be part cat if this doesn't work.
4,0,0,Reality TV is harder than I thought.
4,0,0,Great, we're just recovering from your last Freudian slip and now your one track mind has us in trouble again.
4,0,0,Mind the third rail.
4,1,0,What did I say before we left? You're just gonna have to hold in it now.
4,0,0,Let me check our tickets again.
5,2,0,This is the last time we do acid, right?
4,0,0,Could be worse, we could be in Belgium.
5,0,0,Weekend service is the worst.
6,0,0,It's more efficient than exsanguination. And, by the way, our incontestibility periods have been satisfied.
4,0,0,May be we should run?
4,1,0,We'll get a free ride now
4,0,0,This can't be the right track to recovery
7,1,1,Still, you can't beat the rent.
4,1,0,Maybe it will be different this time.
4,0,0,I've heard about experimental treatment, but this is a train wreck!
4,0,0,Don't tell me where on the uptown tracks.
4,1,0,If only hospitals had an express service.
4,0,0,#TBT
4,0,0,Oh good its the D train!
5,2,0,You are not crazy to believe in peace.
4,1,0,This new insurance company stinks.
4,0,0,My guess would be there will not be a third time.
6,0,1,Now, I'm no genius, but I swear the text said that the settlement conference was on track.
5,3,1,Okay, let's start where we left off last Thursday.
4,1,0,Break time is about over.
5,4,0,Let's pick up where we were last time...you saw a big 'D' coming towards you...
4,0,0,Is this Cheney's best train of thought?
6,3,2,I hope this is just another one of your dreams.
5,0,0,It's tough living on the wrong side of the tracks.
5,0,0,I just cant shake this feeling, We've been here before.
5,3,0,Trust me, we'll be fine just as long as we don't touch the third rail.
4,1,0,THE RESORT FOR DEDICATED RAILROAD WORKERS ON DISABILITY
4,0,0,The nurse said to wait here and our bill would arrive in no time.
4,0,0,But it's rent controlled.
6,0,1,As I hope you're coming to understand, your fear of rats is unfounded.
4,1,0,Ahhh...here it comes...three months in a nice hospital bed....three squares a day...pretty nurses...What could be better?
5,0,0,Fortunately, that train had a cowcatcher.
5,0,0,That must be lunch.
6,1,1,Have we moved past expecting a different result yet?
6,0,1,I think this prolonged exposure therapy is really working!
5,5,1,Nuts, the 6:10 is early again.
5,2,0,I really feel that we're close to a breakthrough.
6,0,0,If this doesn't get us on disability, nothing will.
5,1,0,I'll just keep trying to kill myself, if I can't win the the New Yorker caption contest.
4,0,0,Let's try getting your life off track instead.
4,0,0,Well, I AM known for my empathy.
4,1,0,Our ambulance chaser will be here momentarily on E.
6,0,0,Easy Carl, you're touching the third rail here.
4,0,0,I got in touch with my feelings at our last session Dr. Swartz.
5,1,0,Stanley and Maude always thought that the third try was a charm.
5,2,0,Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
4,1,0,I hope you have enough pain pills left for both of us.
6,2,1,Do you ever think of dying?
4,0,0,We really are from the wrong side of the tracks.
5,2,0,My physical therapist says this is the worst possible position you can lie in.
4,1,0,Tell me about your biggest fear.
4,0,0,You gotta be careful. Back when they made 'Double Indemnity' there was no third rail.
6,1,2,Why don't we continue our session tomorrow in the ICU.
4,1,0,D train's a mite early today.
4,0,0,D-Troit
4,0,0,It's OK. It's a wooden leg.
4,0,0,I don't think it's the train operator who needs to learn from history.
4,0,0,It feels like our relationship left the rails a long time ago.
4,0,0,I should really consider raising my hourly rate for a safer neighborhood.
4,0,0,Ya sure they're gonna take our word for it?
4,0,0,Your witty remarks about the nurses bandaging technique seem to have backfired.
5,2,0,My attorney asked for more substantial injuries.
4,0,0,Let's rail against D end of D line.
6,0,0,Are you sure this is the way we fill find the God Particle like they do in Europe's tunnels
4,0,0,Leave nothing to my wife.
4,0,0,This should increase our chances of a higher disability check.
4,0,0,But why do you feel we're not on the right track?
4,0,0,We left off with your dream about the train going into the tunnel
6,1,1,Termination in psychoanalysis can be challenging to both the patient and the analyst!
6,2,1,I think that we might be on the right track in discovering your irrational fear of trains.
5,0,0,You opted for the 'put-out-to-pasture PPO' too? At least there's no deductible.
4,0,0,Swell. It stopped. Now what do we do?
4,1,0,Are you sure this is an express train....?
4,0,0,Don't ever check the box for "fast track recovery program" in the Affordable Health Care registration form.
6,0,1,Come back and fight! We'll bite off your caboose!
2,1,0,Like I told ya Frank, cast itch, is covered by Obamacare !
4,0,0,I don't know about you, but it make ME feel terrible.
6,2,1,Well, Mr. Smith. This session has come to an end.
5,3,1,We're just about about out of time. Same place next week?
5,2,0,This should work better than sitting in the bike lane did.
4,0,0,And you're sure you haven't heard back from Uber?
5,2,1,Well, lookie there, the D train is right on time.
4,1,0,Really? I prefer Blonde on Blon.....oh.
5,3,0,Are you sure it isn't lightning that never strikes twice?
6,4,0,I'll admit, it's an experimental treatment.
7,2,2,One last game of chicken?
4,1,0,If those suckers lived here they'd be home by now!
4,0,0,Are you certain the furniture isn't going to get in the way this time?
7,0,0,...I got $20,000. You?
4,1,0,This isn't a tenure track position.
7,1,2,Tell me more about this tunnel...
4,1,0,My wife says I'm careless but I tell her I just have really bad luck.
4,0,0,I told you there's no such thing as Superman
4,0,0,I don't appreciate the implication in the label "train chaser".
4,0,0,Rock faster. They're gaining on us!
4,1,0,And this is still safer than a Trump rally.
6,2,2,We ended last session with your keen sense of deja vu. Let's pick it up from there.
4,1,0,You said you wanted a recliner that vibrates.
2,0,0,Is that the downtown or uptown train?
5,1,0,What, specifically, triggers your irrational sense of impending doom?
6,1,1,From my seven-year-old son, Henry: "TRAINing myself to relax."
4,0,0,Let the MTA encroach on the beach. We're not moving!
4,0,0,Wouldn't my siderodromophobia be best cured from inside the train, doc?
4,1,0,If this doesn't get us into Guinness, I'm done.
4,1,0,You getting any R & R ?
5,4,0,We've got to stop meeting like this.
6,0,1,I'm skeptical about this "Underground New York" tour.
4,0,0,Relax. The D Train is always a few minutes late.
6,2,1,Claim a pre-existing condition.
7,0,0,We're going to cure your siderodromophobia or die trying!
6,0,1,It's a draw!! You lost a leg, I lost and arm and it lost a wheel. Do you think the car has Medicare?
4,0,0,Danger is the price we pay as thrill-seekers, Roger.
8,0,0,I think this election year preparation might be too easy.
5,0,0,Are you exposure therapy is best in this case?
4,0,0,Looks like this filibuster's left the station, Hank.
4,0,0,You gotta love that smile.
6,7,2,I think we're BOTH getting tired of you re-living this nightmare.
6,2,1,I liked it better when you talked me off the ledge
5,2,0,Not sure this is worth the extra leg-room.
4,0,0,There aren't many lifetime jobs like this around anymore.
4,0,0,Did you ever think that D is for dummy?....
4,0,0,Inexplicable.
6,0,0,I told you we should have never gone in the bar car!
4,0,0,Just to reiterate, I strongly disagree 'the third time's the charm'.
4,0,0,Maybe we should try the samurai sword next time.
5,0,0,This is a great place to relax for two or three minutes.
4,0,0,Yep. Even our ol' 5:02 knows misery loves company.
4,0,0,I get the sense our visits are causing you pain...
6,6,2,Well, it looks as though our hour is just about up.
4,0,0,So, do you still think our infrastructures aren't that bad? I swear, if it doesn't work this time I'm moving to London.
4,0,0,If you hurt me, i'm telling my mother.
4,1,0,We just can't catch a break.
4,1,0,I know our little scheme looked good on paper, but somehow I feel we've overlooked something in its execution.
4,1,0,Oh well. See you on the other side!
4,0,0,I think our life is on the wrong track!
4,0,0,Will this really help our Worker's Compensation claim?
5,3,0,Something's not right. In my dream it's the 'A' train.
4,0,0,'They ought to make it easier to tell the front from the back.'
6,0,0,They obviously haven’t learned a thing.
4,0,0,Who said political correctness was boring?
4,1,0,The view is not too good but it is close to Metro.
4,0,0,Looks like the end of 'D' line.
4,0,0,So you see, your fear of rats, too, is unfounded in reality.
4,1,0,If we don't win a Guinness World Record this time, I'm out.
4,1,0,I couldn't imagine being anything other than a stuntman.
4,0,0,I know our follow-up surgery is supposed to be expensive, and I'm greatful for President Trump's Healthcare, but don't you think this waiting room is very usual?
4,0,0,Id, shmid. The D train is really real.
7,2,1,''We were working on the railroad. Guess we didn't hear the whistle blow.''
3,1,0,But on the other hand it is convenient,
4,1,0,D Train's latest hits.
4,0,0,Once Again, I told you that timeshare deal was too good to be true!
6,0,0,I always wondered what it would be like to have a quick fix!
3,0,0,I really hate exposure therapy.
4,0,0,I'm not entirely sure this is what they meant by getting "back on track."
7,5,2,I think reliving your trauma isn't doing either of us any good.
5,0,0,We are liberal occupiers, this big money, conservative, work for your money train would never hit us. We're what this country has come to.
4,1,0,Thank goodness, this time it's a local and not the express.
5,3,0,Now that's how fast the healthcare should be!
7,2,3,Lets explore your "impending sense of doom"... again.
4,1,0,Okay, this time, just imagine it's moving.
4,1,0,IF YOU DONT SUCEED THE FIRST TIME, TRY TRY AGAIN
4,0,0,Did you remember to turn off the stove?
4,1,0,Well now we know what the 'D' stands for...
4,0,0,hopefully we die from it this time
7,2,3,There were more people at our last meeting.
4,0,0,Okay, fine. Maybe Marketing was right and "Subway Psychiatrist" should take place INSIDE the cars..."
4,0,0,I think we’ve started out on the wrong track.
5,2,0,Good thing we don't have jobs, cuz protesting is hard work.
5,3,0,I'm getting the whistling sound in my ear again.
6,0,1,What makes you think it is a reasonable fear now?
6,1,0,It's a paradox, I know, but we're safe.
2,0,0,When id your fascination with planes first reveal itself to you?
4,0,0,The D train is never this reliable.
4,1,0,I've woken up in worse places.
4,0,0,I'm drawing a blank
4,0,0,You certainly do not look like one who could be put off for being overly talkative.
5,3,0,Don't you think it's a bit too late for "if you see something, say something.
4,0,0,Too bad we're missing Meatless Monday.
6,0,0,I guess we taught it a lesson it won't forget.
4,0,0,What kind of doctor are you again?
4,1,0,You'll feel a little pinch.
4,0,0,We need to think about a better retirement plan.
4,1,0,How'd that miss?
4,0,0,"So tell me about this 'train of thought dream'"?
5,0,0,How the heck do I know who's backing up this train; you're the Engineer!
4,0,0,Tell me about the rats, George
4,0,0,People can learn, you know.
4,0,0,Good thing we are on the right side of the track this time.
4,0,0,I don't think we'll ever find closure
4,0,0,John, Ted, Donald and the future of the G.O.P.
4,1,0,Doc, I'm not sure this re-enactment therapy is the best idea....
5,2,0,Are you sure they said to wait here for the worker's comp guy?
4,0,0,So the 65" 4K Blu-ray Super Ultra HD TV wasn't enough for you. You just had to go 3D.
6,0,1,The Lord is my shepherd...............
3,0,0,Yep, totally covered. God Bless President Bernie.
4,0,0,Who says NFL players have a problem with foreseeable consequences?
4,0,0,Perhaps there is something to your 'fear of trains' phobia.
5,3,0,I figure this will max out our deductible.
4,0,0,We're close to another breakthrough.
4,1,0,You must face your fears of getting run over by a train, even if you do get run over by a train.
5,1,0,A hundred bucks says it misses us.
4,0,0,Mind the WHAP!
4,1,0,I wonder if Donald Trump will pay the driver's legal fees?
4,0,0,What do you think is a good title for a memoir?
4,0,0,Right on time.
5,3,0,It is deja vu all over again.
4,0,0,Oh sorry, I wanted the C train.
4,0,0,No worries. I was captain of my high school chicken team.
4,0,0,See, I told you Harold we are in the right spot-"keep going down the steps, turn right , and look for the sign that says 'D wing' and you will be at the physical therapy department".
4,0,0,And yet our furniture comes out unscathed each time.
5,0,0,It should be seen as a good first effort in Neo - Gandhism.
4,0,0,Did you have trouble getting here?
4,1,0,Well, I guess there are worse things that could happen.
4,0,0,There is no sign telling us not to do it.
4,0,0,The mind of Tom Cheney
6,0,1,She said it should help our PTSD.
4,0,0,Hey, what happened to the wheels on the right side?
4,0,0,I thought you said the ER not the IRT!
4,1,0,I don't know what's worse, housing costing a figurative or a literal arm and a leg.
5,3,1,Well, it looks like our time is up for today Mr Johnson.
5,2,0,one more hit, and we can pay for our college.
4,1,0,'' Where was Superman when we needed him.''
4,0,0,I never promised that living on the wrong side of the tracks would be a rose garden!
5,1,0,And you say it never gets to Coney Island?
6,0,1,Typical, just when you find a great seat...
4,1,0,Enough about your mother. Now, tell me your first memories about your father."
6,1,2,Guess the light at the end of the tunnel was the headlight of the train.
4,1,0,So it's the D again--we'll continue this on the other side this time, sliding scale.
5,2,0,It's better than sticking around waiting to win the New Yorker Caption Contest.
4,0,0,This new job is bringing us closer together.
4,0,0,All my life I've felt like I've missed the train. All I've done is given myself front row seats.
4,0,0,I'm very invested in my patients.
4,0,0,We tend to ignore what is right in front of us.
4,0,0,Don't worry. This time we're doing it with half the wheels.
4,0,0,tell me once again about your fear of trains.
6,1,1,Think of it like evening out a tan.
4,0,0,My shrink says this is the only way to conquer my fear of being run over by a train and get back to work changing tires.
5,1,0,Think of it this way: it's like lightening striking twice in the same place.
4,0,0,Close your eyes and go to your happy place .... quickly!
6,0,0,Guardrails weren't an obstacle to this 'comfy zone'? I wonder what colorful platform edges and signage would have led to.
5,0,0,The MTA's AirBNB game is strong.
5,0,0,Harry, Is the Train Coming or Going? If it's Coming We're in Big Trouble!
4,0,0,I can see your house from here.
4,0,0,No not now! We'll deal with you fear of flying some time next spring.
6,0,0,Would you please quit whistling "Get on the Right Track, Baby"?
4,1,0,If it doesn't work this time, we'll just have to learn to live with Trump as President.
4,0,0,I think I may punch-out early today.
4,1,0,Are we about to run over time again?
3,0,0,It's the loss of memory that really bugs me.
4,0,0,I just can't seem to overcome this feeling of deja vu.
5,2,0,I'm startin' to hear that clickity-clackin' again.
4,1,0,This round of aversion therapy is going to hurt me a lot more than it hurts you!
4,0,0,The Donald Trump train picks up only idiots.
4,1,0,I don't think we are quite on track with this plan.
4,1,0,Are you sure this is what the doctor meant by being in traction?
4,0,0,Next week, can we work on my fear of flying?
5,0,0,So who knew the D train has a bar car now?
4,0,0,This is the last time I will live in a railroad apartment
4,1,0,Is it me or does this train have on a happy face?
4,0,0,Cost an arm and a leg.
4,0,0,It's just a day at Brighton Beach, you'll never remember.
4,0,0,Because F stood for faster doesn't mean D means delayed.
5,2,0,If I also grab my personal third rail, you can charge me for overtime.
4,1,0,Call it pop psychology but D train desensitization promotes extinction of phobias.
4,0,0,The listing said it was 'railroad style'
5,3,0,Are you sure it was "Take the D Train"?
5,3,1,How many times are we going to try this "face your fears" therapy?
4,0,0,They say it's a short-lived rush.
4,0,0,no way jose
5,2,0,One last time...is this train your mother or your father?
4,0,0,Hey Doc ! I think this is the definition of insanity.
4,0,0,THIS will get us a settlement!
4,0,0,Who told you this was a cure for PTSD?
4,0,0,I meant the Bob Dylan album.
4,1,0,"When I applied for a job as a buffer I thought they wanted me to polish cars".
4,0,0,I daresay I am a little nervous to tell the doc at our next Death By Subway Phobia group that this exposure therapy has become a bit extreme. Do you think it is working?" "Perhaps a little.
5,2,0,Well, our group therapy sessions are down to just you now.
4,0,0,See? The brakes work no better on this line.
6,2,1,I'm pretty sure Freudian analysis is based on theoretical trains.
4,0,0,I know it hurts to give up the fantasy of my omnipotence; but that defensive train has passed.
4,6,0,Just one more time, and we'll hit our deductible.
6,1,1,Okay, this is the last item on our bucket list.
6,1,0,THIS protest better work.
5,1,0,I'm betting that THIS TIME, it's finally going to chicken out.
6,1,1,Maybe this time it'll satisfy our deductible.
4,1,0,Look on the bright side. Gauze is covered under our plan.
5,2,0,You know honey..I think our ship is finally going to come in.
5,2,0,Maybe we should worry less about the symbolism.
4,0,0,When do you suppose it leaves the station?
5,3,0,It's important to keep the discussion on track.
4,0,0,In my wildest dreams I never imagined the end would come this way.
6,0,1,we'd best be moving along before the cartoonist finishes putting wheels on that subway car
4,0,0,I love to go to sleep listening to the sound of trains in the distance.
4,0,0,You know what Ed, one of these days we will catch a break...
5,2,0,I would prefer the 'A' train.
4,0,0,I think this one's the game changer.
6,3,0,What if the "D" doesn't stand for disabled?
4,0,0,I'm having an out-of-life experience.
4,0,0,Living on the edge.
5,2,0,There has to be a better way to get our lives back on track
5,3,1,Hair of the dog.
4,0,0,we are made up of steel. as long as we can stand tall. we can win this fight. now we are still (breathing) right?????
5,0,0,Ah, the sound of a forty ton train heading straight for you at fifty miles an hour. When you live in New York this is maybe the the third weirdest thing that happens to you in a week.
5,3,0,Now, this time, what are you going to do differently?
4,0,0,"Do you think our lawyers got our tweet?".
4,1,0,Trust me: if there is no mustached villain involved, we're safe.
4,0,0,I've decided to give my boss a piece of my mind...
5,4,0,What doesn't kill you makes you stronger! Really?
4,1,0,Sometimes, I really wonder if we're on the right track...
4,1,0,Its 3pm, we call this the 3-D experience
6,2,1,I have to say Doc, I'm deeply impressed by your commitment to Physician-assisted suicide.
4,0,0,Don't worry, my Injury Attorney takes the D train.
5,0,0,An attempt to keep our recovery on track by taking vitamin D.
4,1,0,We'd still be wailing on the track if that was the local.
4,0,0,Well, he did say he would tear up Obamacare on his first day in office.
4,1,0,Nope, I'd still rather not talk about your family coming to visit.
4,1,0,I can see our time is up.
4,0,0,Beats our last session under the train
6,1,1,Your session is about to expire.
6,2,1,Face it Lenny, insurance fraud is in our blood.
5,0,0,There's gotta be an easier way to wake up without coffee.
5,0,0,Our due diligence has raised some concerns about your “Subway Departure Lounge” concept.
4,0,0,This is cheaper than a stay in a New York City hospital.
5,0,0,Thankfully, the doctor put us on the fast track to recovery.
4,0,0,Who knew trainspotting could be so dangerous?
3,0,0,My diagnosis is Siderodromophobia, Mr. Bailey. Take the bus next time.
4,0,0,Careful of the third rail. It's very dangerous.
4,0,0,You can only have so many bumps, scrapes, and wrecks before you realize you're the real source of the problem
4,0,0,I told you we should have taken the A train.
4,1,0,I think I changed my mind.
4,0,0,Crash dummies on vacation.
4,0,0,We never saw that bus coming.
4,0,0,An Accident Waiting to Happen
7,3,3,Exposure therapy can be hit-or-miss.
4,0,0,Don't forget we're here to deconstruct your old self.
4,0,0,Another round of gambling therapy? We're due for a win!
4,0,0,Are you sure this time the emergency brake system is set?
4,1,0,You think this will finally use up our deductible?
4,0,0,So why do you feel we are all being railroaded?
5,2,0,If I'm right, you go back on your meds. If you're right, you get to rewrite Einstein's definition of insanity. Deal?
4,1,0,If I go down, we'll all get splinters!
4,0,0,Aah yes, siderodromophobia, the fear of trains ...although, I'm less versed on the fear of broken bones.
4,1,0,On the plus side, these life coach sessions are free.
6,0,1,I'm having second thoughts about this fare increase protest.
4,0,0,We were suspicious when our son-in-law gave us the location for the flash mob...
4,0,0,Tell me more about this ominous feeling you've been having...
4,0,0,I had no idea training would be so arduous.
5,4,1,No, I really want to be rescued.
4,0,0,I feel like you're not really hearing me...
3,0,0,Fortitude!
6,0,1,Let's call it 'Twentieth century death with dignity.'
5,3,0,The important thing is that we've learned something...
5,2,0,I was thinking we could conduct this immersion therapy in your office next time Doc.
4,0,0,It still beats summers in the Hamptons.
5,0,0,Tell me about your mother.
4,1,0,A Freudian. Why?
4,2,0,Is this the best way to catch the train?
6,1,1,I so enjoy this frequent rider lounge.
4,0,0,Seems the emergency brakes have failed again.
4,0,0,YouTube fame awaits!
4,0,0,I guess we won't be taking the "D" train to rehab.
5,0,0,It looks as if it will tip over soon
6,2,1,Our last session was a train wreck, but now I think we're on the right track.
4,0,0,So have you had any traumatic experiences in your past?
4,0,0,Don't you hate it when the express train is on time?
6,2,1,You were right, the D train does smell kinda off.
4,1,0,I've got a great P.I. lawyer if the D train doesn't stop here.
5,3,0,Let's wait for the F.
4,1,0,Imagine if the damn thing had been on time.
4,0,0,Just to say - this is the last time I'm going along with your 'no pain no gain' theory
5,0,0,Face it, we're derailed, determined and soon to be deceased.
4,0,0,[Client] I have this reoccurring nightmare where I'm about to get hit by a train... [Doctor] Nothing a little exposure therapy can't fix.
4,0,0,Now we're gonna get bandage lines on our tan
4,1,0,At least we have seats for the rush hour commute.
4,0,0,When you said you wanted to eat at Subway, I thought you meant the other place.
6,2,0,Well Jim, looks like we picked the wrong place to convalesce.
4,1,0,I’ll be damned if we’re denied Worker’s Comp this time!
5,0,0,Look, no sparks.
4,0,0,Training for the 2020 X-Games
5,2,0,This train delay is really making me rethink this suicide.
6,0,1,You've got to understand physical pain. After that we can move on to your childhood.
4,1,0,This time, are you sure, sure, sure the train is about to leave, not back up?
4,0,0,You said the B line, right Ralph?
4,1,0,Shall we order takeout?
4,0,0,'I feel confident that by the end of this session your fear of oncoming vehicles will have much abated.'
4,0,0,Three's the charm.
4,1,0,What don't kill you only makes you stronger. If this doesn't work we'll try the N train next.
5,0,0,I told you we needed to be more specific in that living will.
5,0,0,I can't tell if I'm coming or going.
4,1,0,sometimes the contestants get a second chance in the suicide game
2,0,0,WE"RE ACCIDENT RESULTS WAITING TO HAPPEN.
4,1,0,If this wasn't the family business, I'd quit and do something else.
3,1,0,Tarmac on Tuesday?
4,0,0,Shoulda purchased Obamacare!
5,4,0,Only three more treatments before you are completely over your fear of trains.
5,3,0,Well, I'm not going to take this lying down.
4,1,0,Damn D Train... Back at it again
5,4,1,You're sure that's the back of the train, right?
6,1,1,What do YOU think it means that you constantly see "trains moving in tunnels"?
5,3,0,I'm afraid that's all the time we have. Again.
4,0,0,You were right Harry when you said that we are first in line for the train.
4,0,0,I'm beginning to think there are more practical ways to address this particular phobia.
4,0,0,Well my Human Cannonball days at Coney Island are over, but I still enjoy visiting.
4,0,0,Aren't they two minutes early, or is my watch wrong?
5,0,0,Ya think our Obamacare is gonna cover this?
4,0,0,So what else can happen to us?
3,5,0,Looks like we’re out of time today ....
7,1,0,Just a couple of virgins would be nice ...
6,4,2,You don't hear that?
4,1,0,Doctor,my wife says I'm a train wreck waiting to happen
4,0,0,Yes, this was the preferred way to find out what having over three hundred train dreams really means.
4,0,0,She's right - it could be a double entendre
3,1,0,It's all about safety first.
4,1,0,The wheels came off my campaign early.
5,3,0,You know what they say: 'Location, location, location.'
6,0,1,Reliving experiences is good for the mind.
4,0,0,... and how does that make you feel
6,1,1,I'm protesting the quality of the tissue in the onboard restrooms. What's your beef?
5,1,0,Look, Dave! It's the same driver who hit us here last week.
4,1,0,I'm just glad we get to go out as a penis joke.
4,0,0,This train should be renamed "O" for "Ouch". Being TRAINED to do track repairs AND doing it while the train is active wasn't the smartest idea.
4,0,0,I guess we missed thr Club Car.
6,2,1,I still think a cash settlement would have been better.
6,1,1,This is the last stop.
4,0,0,Well sure this is a train wreck but you should have seen my last relationship.
4,0,0,This time we're going to get REALLY BIG compensation!"
4,0,0,...and do you see the train as your id or your ego?
4,0,0,Ralph, I don't think we're far enough 'off the grid'.
6,1,1,It's necessary, Bob, to demonstrate to you that going down the same track expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. In my own experience, I submitted countless captions to the Cartoon Contest, never won- and finally just plain quit.
4,1,0,They can't deny us for benefits after this...
4,0,1,Do you think we are on the right track?
5,0,0,Safer than a Trump rally.
4,0,0,I guess we shouldn't have told her the sandwiches were soggy.
4,0,0,Dammit. Another D train.
4,0,0,I know you love Obamacare, but how about Miami instead of the West Side?
4,0,0,Good thing the transit workers are on strike this week.
4,1,0,Same old same old
5,0,0,Hey, what do you know? The city actually does have money to run this train!
6,2,1,Still you got to love the convenience.
4,1,0,Did your attorney explain how this would all play out?
7,5,3,Well, it appears our time is up.
6,2,1,Still afraid.
5,2,0,Some morons call it the Death train
4,0,0,I wasn't expecting the freakin Mets to actually win!
5,0,0,Well, therapy can be painful sometimes.
5,3,0,I'll show you the difference between fantasy and reality if it's the last thing I do.
6,1,2,Look, no one's ever died of déjà—.
5,1,0,GORGEOUS View! WON'T LAST!
5,0,0,I never liked retakes.
5,0,0,I'm starting to think that maybe trainspotting isn't the hobby for me.
4,0,0,Well, we tried the high road.
6,0,1,I told you that with enough trial and error we'd find the end of the line.
4,0,0,See? It obviously wan't your fault; no wheels.
4,0,0,The protest of the 2nd Avenue line hasn't gone as planned.
4,0,0,I could've sworn the ad said subLET.
5,2,0,Do you think this will fulfill our family deductible?
4,1,0,When did you first notice these "feelings" ?
4,0,0,Mistakes were made.
5,6,1,And how did that impact you?
6,0,1,We were just relaxing and minding our own business.
5,1,0,Remind me again — this train goes to the hospital, right?
4,0,0,Well, in his defense, that realtor did say that we would be close to the subway.
4,0,0,Blimey mate, we’ve gotten into the wrong cartoon!
7,1,1,Being a Crash Test Dummy isn't the same as the brochure describes.
4,0,0,Yes dear we are Egg Firsters, but there are many fine Chicken Firsters.
4,0,0,The therapist recommends immersion therapy for the fear of trains...........
4,0,0,I think I hear by watch beeping.
6,3,2,Wait. Maybe it's lightning that doesn't strike twice.
4,0,0,What's it mean when the shrink really identifies with the patient?
4,0,0,Do you think we'll make it to E?
6,2,1,I don't know that your insurance will continue to cover our sessions here.
6,0,1,So this was your idea of how to get your life back on track.
4,4,0,On second thought, perhaps immersion therapy isn't the appropriate course of action for addressing your particular phobia.
4,0,0,Being in the National Truth or Dare Championships makes it all worthwhile.
6,0,0,Shangri-la, Really-la!
6,1,1,Let's just trust Automatic Block Signaling. Yesterday it almost worked.
7,3,3,I make terrible decisions when I'm plastered.
4,0,0,It's better than taking the pus bus.
4,0,0,Are you sure we are at the right end?
6,0,0,Those Emergency Ward doctors and nurses got us back out here incredibly quickly!
4,1,0,Why did I procrastinate on my suicide note?
5,2,0,They really need to update their emergency brake test.
6,2,1,Those who say Obamacare is derailed don't know what they're talking about.
4,1,0,I don't forsee that being an issue. But, I'm not exactly known for my foresight.
4,0,0,Relax; the D is always slow.
4,1,0,I am being rail lazy today! I wish there wouldn't be any trains going through every 5 seconds.
4,1,0,I'm sure glad our year of living dangerously is almost over.
4,0,0,Coming home is always the best part.
5,4,0,Remember when the subway was safe?
4,0,0,So in these dreams, exactly when does the next train come?
5,4,0,In today's session, I'd like you to try facing your fears head on by yourself.
4,0,0,Accidents waiting to happen.
4,0,0,What did you expect? The ad said, I was a trained therapist!
4,0,0,Trust me, I'm a trained psychologist
6,1,0,Have to make the most of Obamacare while we have it.
5,2,0,Well he hasn't stopped yet, I guess I owe you another dollar.
4,0,0,No, I don't think that train is going to Hogwarts.
6,1,2,how could it be worse?
4,0,0,I was rejected for permanent disability the first time, but I think it'll go through real soon.
6,2,1,We'll get more from them this time, I promise.
5,3,0,The essence of any phobia therapy is learning to stop and redirect your negative thinking.

3,0,0,My medical diagnosis is finally on track.
4,0,0,I know it didn't work out so well the last time we tried this…
7,0,0,Isn't this the same breakthrough about childhood trips to Coney Island we had last week?
6,1,1,I'm done heckling Trump.
4,0,0,I must have missed the memo!
4,1,0,Uh Oh! It has that smile again!
4,0,0,the two guys are sitting on a chair and waiting to die because the train would come over them and kill them.
4,1,0,Relax - we're nowhere near the third rail.
6,0,0,The disability train comes to the trauma track with tricked up treatment again.
4,0,0,I told you this wasn't the High Line.
4,0,0,This is gonna be one helluva law suit!
5,2,0,Couch or coach ?
4,0,0,You were my destiny.
4,0,0,Maybe we should rethink the whole 'safety first' thing.
5,3,0,Psychologically, we've made progress. Physically however...
6,3,1,In our next session we'll confront your fear of snakes.
6,1,1,Did the A train go by already?
5,0,0,Relax, we've got 25 minutes till E.
5,0,0,Doc, I feel we're on the wrong track.
5,2,0,I feel like I'm an accident waiting to happen.
4,0,0,See I told you, we get way better rays on the D Line!
4,1,0,It's a good training.
5,3,1,Let's see Disability deny this one.
4,0,0,Honey, I still think we need to sell this timeshare
2,0,0,This is what happens when our parents don't let us play with trains
4,0,0,At least we aren't on the third rail.
4,0,0,It's really rough being an adrenaline junkie.
4,1,0,You're making great progress John. I think we can talk politics again.
4,0,0,Ah, now THIS is al fresco!
4,0,0,Fasten your seatbelt...it's going to be a bumpy night.
4,0,0,I love this movie.
4,0,0,Maybe we should move; it's 'way too noisy here.
4,0,0,No matter, I'm all broke to pieces anyway.
4,0,0,Isn't this putting the cart before the horse?
6,2,1,Well, here it comes... better late than never!
4,0,0,I prefer to call it full body training.
4,1,0,Once again, I respectfully state that you are on the wrong train of thought.
4,0,0,"This week's cartoon is brought to you by the letter "D". Can you say "dummies"?
6,3,1,At least it's on time.
4,0,0,Donald may have momentum, but we can still get enough delegates to stop him.
4,1,0,Again? You need remedial psychology "training"?
4,0,0,I'm beginning to understand your fear of trains
4,1,0,I know the MTA provides sick leave, Haversham, but I really need to finish installing those right rear wheels!
4,0,0,Just like I said the last time, if the train backs up, which again is highly unlikely, we'll deal with it. Now just sit back and relax.
3,0,0,I was waiting for the E!
3,0,0,The train waits for US!
3,0,0,I didn't know there was a massage setting too.
5,3,1,And how is this going to make you feel?
6,1,1,Bad day to give up drinking.
6,1,1,...and why do you think you carry this sense of impending doom?
7,4,3,I see that our time is up.
4,0,0,I just feel, Nathan, that we're not quite on the right track with your therapy.
4,0,0,I told you I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
4,0,0,In the 3rd quarter, we were sidetracked by the Iron Horse’s defense, and I was derailed by injuries. What’s your story?
6,0,1,Still beats the bus.
4,0,0,OK, let's resume where we left off last time.
4,0,0,Let go of fear and trust the process.
7,2,1,We should have brought the murphy bed!
4,0,0,Watch out for the third rail this time.
4,1,0,I think we can safely cross this off our bucket list.
4,0,0,I don't see things getting any WORSE! Do you?
6,2,1,I wouldn't want to arouse you angst any further, but did you notice that the train has no wheels on that side?
6,1,1,I think we're still on the wrong track.
6,1,1,The brochure said there are great views of the C.
6,1,0,I'm damn tired of these flashbacks.
4,0,0,Listen, it's a D train...can we just enjoy the irony?
4,0,0,Get out the way, the Big Apple is coming!
4,0,0,Thank God for Obamacare! Only other choice is Canada....huh....matter of fact does that train go that far north?
4,0,0,Again ?!?!
5,3,1,We're going to keep trying, Phil, until you overcome your fear of trains.
4,0,0,Well heckfire. They're gainin' on us and my gun's outta water.
3,0,0,Doctor, I don't think this train aversion therapy is working
5,2,0,I feel like this exposure therapy thing is actually beginning to work.
4,0,0,Jokes about suicide leave me flat.
4,0,0,My psychologist told me to face my fears.
4,1,0,Injury lawsuits! A little risky but good money.
5,0,0,Visitors hours run about every 15 minutes.
4,1,0,Fred MacMurray made it look so easy.
6,3,2,Maybe we'll reach our deductible now
4,0,0,So in our last session you likened your divorce to being in a plane crash. Today, you say it feels like a train wreck. Walk me through what that's like.
5,1,0,"Just a little disappointed in our physical therapy cover".
4,1,0,I know office space is spendy Doc, but I thought you were kidding about costing an arm and a leg!
4,0,0,They must be improving service!
5,3,1,Yeah, I suppose you could call it an obsession.
6,0,1,Finally , a nice day,
4,0,0,I can do this all day, you know!
4,0,0,We're right on track for our training
5,2,1,Nope, I didn't see this clause in my health insurance plan either.
4,1,0,This is what life feels like when you don't go to college. Kids, do yoursleves a favor and do good in school!
6,0,1,After months of failed diagnoses, I still don't think we're on the right track to recovery.
4,1,0,Tell me more about Dad.
5,2,0,I must admit that this immersion therapy is curing my phobia of trains. Now I'm just afraid of doctors.
4,0,0,That's the last time I take Uber.
4,0,0,How else are you supposed to test your life insurance startup.
4,1,0,What was it that made you lose all hope?
5,1,0,We need to rethink this rest stop.
4,0,0,I told you this was the one without the "disabled passenger " car.
6,0,0,Still horny for our 'golden' years?
6,1,1,I liked it better when we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
4,1,0,One limb each and comfy seats--hey, not bad for regular fare.
6,0,1,I think I just saw a rat!
4,0,0,They dumped us.
4,0,0,This time will stop those metro lobbyists dead in their tracks.
4,1,0,We may not be on the right track to recovery!
4,0,0,It is a metaphorical train.
4,1,0,This should help relieve your trainophobia.
6,1,1,Break a leg!
5,2,0,It's brake time!
4,0,0,Careful. Don't touch the third rail.
5,0,0,I told you the wrapping was just a waste of time.
4,1,0,Tell me again. We're the brakemen?
6,3,2,Do you get the feeling we've reached the end of the line?
5,0,0," I told you four years ago, they don't do whistle stops in the subway'
4,0,0,These are the brakes of the game.
6,0,0,Conflicts between the conscious and the unconscious are usually solved by the MTA, but this is getting ridiculous.
4,0,0,That's ridiculous, there no such thing as accident prone.
6,2,1,He said this is the only option our health plan covers.
5,1,0,Yeah, well you were so sure you knew the schedule the last time.
4,1,0,Just relax, Frank; nobody is ignoring our claim this time.
4,0,0,I don't understand what's holding up the lounge car.
5,2,0,Riding the rails seems much more comfortable these days.
4,0,0,Well at least they left better than they found us.
4,0,0,We should jay walk during rush hour again. That was fun.
4,0,0,I think we went off the rails a bit this week
4,5,1,Don't worry.. Insurance will pay for everything except the chairs
5,3,0,I thought it had a lounge car.
4,0,0,Well, I guess we are cast offs
4,1,0,I'd like to reiterate once again that method therapy is a long process.
4,0,0,Doc, exposure therapy should result in physical therapy.
5,5,0,Ugh. I JUST sat down.
4,1,0,And when was the last time you had one of these 'deja vu moments'?
5,2,0,I hate playing the same track over and over.
4,1,0,I agree, your delusion does seem very real.
5,3,1,I hear that in the future they will be switching to crash dummies.
5,3,0,I feel railroaded into this therapy session.
5,0,0,We never learn, do we?
4,0,0,I said staying on track for our bucket list, not getting on track.
4,0,0,And you said things were looking up.
5,1,0,Call it a hunch, but I think our doctor might not have the proper training.
4,0,0,When you just want a drink and your friend takes you here.
4,0,0,As your psychologist, I maintain that this is the only way we can conquer your fear of being run over by a commuter train.
4,0,0,I want you to focus more on your immediate future, which is why I've switched locations to a local line.
4,1,0,Riding the rails isn't as fun as it used to be.
4,1,0,I remember when rail transport didn't cost an arm and a leg.
4,1,0,Free appendectomy here we come!
4,0,0,Just relax. You'll like it.
4,0,0,The Economy.
4,0,0,Are you sure people will get the metaphor?
4,0,0,Recovery has been tough, but I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
4,1,0,This way we can say that we've lived and died on the railroad.
7,0,2,Beats workin!
4,1,0,At least it was nice of them to give us their seats.
4,1,0,This will conclude our thearpy sessions.
7,2,1,Yeah, but it's still safer than playing football.
4,0,0,I'll have to talk to my real estate agent about the term "other side of the track."
4,1,0,It's a shame they moved us out here. I hear the A train treats their casualties a lot better.
5,1,0,I guess this is what they mean by 'sub standard' healthcare.
4,1,0,Confronting your fear of heights went well, so let's talk about your obsession with trains and tunnels.
3,0,0,Next time, let's take the A train
4,0,0,You're physically on track, but it's the mental aspect that worries me.
4,0,0,We're one infrastructure failure away from reaching our deductible.
5,5,1,Okay, train, best of three.
4,0,0,Surviving the 8 story jump from their office derailed their plans so Bill and Jim decided the train was a better way to go.
4,1,0,``If you say `wrong place, wrong time' once more, I'll scream.''
4,0,0,I'm prone to what did you say?
4,1,0,You sure this is the best way to get worker's comp?
4,0,0,I think we have more pressing issues.
4,0,0,when the going gets rough
4,0,0,The cartoon is not visible......(not a caption,just a fact)
4,0,0,Facing fear - finally
4,0,0,OF COURSE HE SEES US. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS SCHEME
5,1,0,I'm starting to really miss Dr. Kevorkian.
6,2,1,Do you ever feel like we're pressing our luck?
6,2,1,I know it doesn't feel like progress, but I feel like we're very close to getting you over this whole "fear of trains" thing.
4,0,0,Trust me!
3,0,0,I know we are helping our medical insurer but what did they mean about helping human evolution?
6,0,1,I finally feel like we're on track.
4,0,0,Wish my wheelset had come on time... Somehow I feel calmer with the Northbound D Train... This is usually more fun with pennies...
6,0,1,So tell me, how often do you hear trains?
5,4,0,Have some faith - we stopped it the first time
4,0,0,You know, I don't like to brag but...
5,3,1,Looks like our careers as stuntmen maybe coming to an end.
4,1,0,Now for our final Systematic Desensitization session.
4,0,0,Trust me Art this is going to be much easier than base jumping!
4,1,0,Mass transit--the sport of masochists.
6,0,1,are you sure this is the only way we will get coverage?
6,5,2,For the last time, sometimes a train really is just a train.
4,0,0,I know it's risky, but you really can't beat the view.
4,0,0,What do you say next trip we skip the Club Car!
4,0,0,De train, the train, tomato, tomahto.
4,1,0,Is that your stomach growling?
4,0,0,I hate that sadistic motorman who stops the train before it hits us.
5,3,0,Exposure therapy isn't working. Why don't you just get a car?
5,2,1,My HMO suggested this treatment.
4,1,0,I continue to be haunted by my recent past.
6,0,1,It's all so random.
5,0,0,I thought you said the next train was not an express.
6,1,1,I figure this will finally get me above my deductible.
5,4,0,These virtual reality helmets are awesome. That train looks like you could touch it.
6,2,1,I feel like a train wreck!
5,0,0,When she said the pain management clinic is on the D Line, she didn't mean ON THE D LINE.
4,0,0,Medical euthanasia would have been less painful, don't you think?
4,0,0,We seem to be stuck on the same track.
4,0,0,I know the healing process is tough but it still feels like we're on the wrong track.
5,0,0,The Power of Two
4,1,0,We ran over!
4,0,0,Trust me, In Vivo Exposure Therapy has strong support in the literature.
5,3,1,Rent in Manhattan costs an arm and a leg.
4,0,0,Wait, I'm getting that Déjà vu feeling.
4,1,0,Do you still want to grab some beers when our shift is over?
5,1,0,Will their insurance pay this time?
4,1,0,Doc, I know you believe in exposure therapy, but I'm starting to wonder if we couldn't find a better place for our weekly sessions.
4,1,0,I don't think this is the best way to cure your phobia of trains.
4,0,0,"Well, there are other ways to get to Coney Island.
4,0,0,ON SECOND THOUGHT, I THINK THIS IS A REALLY STUPID IDEA.
4,1,0,It helps me keep track of when the hour's up.
4,5,0,Sure it's a bit dangerous, but it's rent controlled.
4,0,0,Doc, ever since you tried to show me that traffic is not dangerous, I have been having bad dreams about our sessions.
4,0,0,Let's dig a hole!! Ha ha ha!!
4,1,0,Ugh, not this again... No, Bob, I don't hear anything.
7,0,2,This seemed like a much better idea when we were drinking.
4,0,0,The partners say it's all about billable hours, dude.
4,1,0,This should get 'er done.
4,0,0,Cognitive dissonance be damned, this new evidence is beginning to convince me that things are never going to be great again.
4,1,0,I just can't continue to repeat your past with you...
4,0,0,Can't hurt us this time, Fred. First, it's smiling. Second, only has wheels on one side.
6,6,3,This will be our last session
4,0,0,Fool me once, shame on...
3,0,0,I thought this line was shutdown, but I've been wrong before.
4,0,0,I always thought 'Medicare is the third rail of politics' was just an expression.
4,0,0,We've never been very good at the whole timing thing.
4,1,0,We'll be at Coney Island in no time.
4,0,0,If h backs up we;re going to need more bandages.
4,0,0,At least I'll still have my personality.
5,0,0,When I was a little boy, we use to play on the tracks.
4,0,0,Been down so long, it looks like up to me. Richard Farina
4,0,0,I used to feel guilty about being a burden on the health care system, but not since Obamacare covered pre-existing conditions
6,0,1,Way to go, man.
4,1,0,That blast of air before impact is quite refreshing.
4,0,0,Its a bad insurance settlement
4,0,0,Its not traction....its "track shun"...
5,4,0,Now we know what the D stands for.
4,0,0,I figure one more personal injury claim and I can retire.
4,0,0,All aboard the pit-D train
4,1,0,Relax. My chiropractor calls it "aversion therapy".
6,0,0,Our last session of systematic desensitization of my fear of trains proves you are taking my "therapy" a little too seriously.
4,0,0,It's cheaper and less painful than waiting at the doctor's office.
4,1,0,I'm telling you... you've GOT to face your fears
7,0,0,We're going to try something new today.
6,2,2,I guess this is the end of the line.
6,0,1,Now, where was I? Oh, yes - getting you back on track ...
5,0,0,I've empathized with you and I've sympathized with you. Now, for once, you are going to feel my pain.
6,1,1,Don't worry. It's the third rail that kills you.
4,0,0,We're being railroaded.
4,1,0,You must be dying for that cast to come off.
5,2,0,In one second, my leg won't hurt any more.
4,0,0,It appears as though we're running out of time.
3,0,0,I made eye contact.
4,0,0,So tell me, for how long have you had this dream about being D-trained?
7,1,1,Another untimely end
4,1,0,See? Doesn't it feel good to face things head on?
5,4,1,Sometimes a train in a tunnel isn’t just a metaphor.
4,1,0,Rail travel cost an arm and a leg these days
4,0,0,Won't be long now.
5,0,0,Does anyone need to stop at the bathroom before the meeting?
4,0,0,I told you to mind the gap.
4,0,0,Don't worry, third time's the charm.
5,5,0,Best two out of three.
4,0,0,Talk about feeling like The Wreck of the Hesperus.
4,0,0,Last week I think we saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
5,0,0,It's strange how I never saw it coming.
4,0,0,I ever I never noticed there was that brick wall as we went under the wheels of 'Old 97'.
4,0,0,If this doesn't work out, we're waiting at the platform next time.
4,0,0,Next, we should try the E train.
4,0,0,Tell me, how do you FEEL about the Yankees this year?
6,1,1,Don't worry, I'm sure he's not going to move!
4,0,0,You've seen one ER, you've seen 'em all.
4,0,0,This time I'm worried! Our name is Katz not Cats
4,0,0,Guess we didn't pass the Bechdel test?
4,0,0,It's time to hop aboard.
5,0,0,After what Obama did to us, how could Hillary be any worse?
4,1,0,So with this type of training, Doc, you think that I will be able to walk again?
4,1,0,Maybe we're on the wrong track again.
4,0,0,We should have riden the third rail.
6,2,1,Think back... now describe to me when you first felt like you were run over by a train.
4,1,0,What kind of rehab is this again?
5,2,0,I think we're getting somewhere. Let's try again next week.
4,0,0,My best panhandling scheme yet. Just give them a little more time.
5,2,0,They'll start stopping, trust me.
4,0,0,Wrigley Schmigley. The Bronx ain't Chicago.
4,1,0,Oops!
5,0,1,Before my wife made Engineer, we had to live all over the place!
5,0,0,I may not have mentioned that I'm one of those Notre Dame subway alumni you've heard so much about.
5,0,0,Well, you know, pretending to live a Tolstoy existence, isn't going to cover up your Dostoyevsky tendencies. And yes. The big fat caboose is laughing at you.
3,1,0,I think they call it out-patient treatment now.
4,0,0,What's that noise?
3,0,0,Not to worry. Its a legal sit-in.
4,0,0,Why are we here? i mean in the metaphysical sense?
5,1,0,I haven't met my deductible yet.
4,0,0,I'm afraid this interactive therapy is going nowhere.
4,0,0,I said 'RE-train' our bodies.
5,3,0,It seems we got sidetracked
4,0,0,I thought you told me the D train didn't run on holidays.
4,0,0,It would take a keen sense of humor to express why we were lucky that this train wasn't running on all its wheels.
5,1,0,Death: Take 2
4,0,0,No, D does not stand for Delightful
5,0,0,Going, going, gone!
8,2,0,I sometimes wonder if there was a catch to complaining about too much sun in our room.
4,0,0,John, I get tired of doing crash testing and I think this one we will be out for a long time. Well Pat, at least we are comfortable.
4,0,0,Do you hear the roar of the ocean?
4,1,0,Eternity: Right on time!
4,0,0,No need to fret. We're just cartoon characters.
4,0,0,I don't think your train aversion therapy is working.
3,1,0,Are you sure workers' comp covers pre-existing conditions?
4,1,0,Don't be silly! Everyone knows lightning doesn't strike twice.
4,1,0,Where are we going next?
7,0,2,Let's try once more to figure out what the train symbolizes.
8,0,0,History will record that driverless cars have needed hundreds of human interventions to stop accidents!
4,1,0,It's best we don't get off track.
4,1,0,I think we made a lot of progress on your siderodromophobia. On your next session we'll tackle...AAAHHH!
4,1,0,Part of me is starting to think this was a bad idea.
4,0,0,To paraphrase Freud, sometimes a tunnel is just a tunnel.
5,2,1,As long as we don't touch the third rail, we should be fine this time.
4,0,0,Let's try this again.
4,0,0,The good news is this one stopped. The bad news is that we want the 'C' train.
5,0,0,I appreciate your passing on the savings for office space, but I haven't recovered from the previous session.
4,0,0,I don't think we are on the right track of the High Line.
5,1,0,I don't know how they missed us that time.
5,1,1,I really need to get an office.
4,0,0,Unfortunately, your insurance won't cover this either.
4,0,0,At least we're not waiting for Godot
6,1,1,This way, the railroad pays our hospital bills.
4,1,0,If you see something, say something.
5,0,0,I believe there is no tomorrow!
4,0,0,You think we would have learned the first time
4,0,0,It's really tough getting seats during rush hour.
4,0,0,Okay, this time I swear I'll ask out the nurse.
4,0,0,This should help us meet our deductible.
6,1,2,How do those Darwin Awards work again?
4,1,0,Let's go over this whole "lightning never strikes twice" theory of yours again ...
5,0,0,Yes, I would still rather be here than the Trump rally.
5,0,1,Is this your idea of aversion therapy?
4,0,0,I preferred Occupy Wall Street.
4,0,0,Where's the @#$&!@!! cartoon?
4,0,0,I double-checked the schedule. This time we'll have the whole hour.
4,0,0,Once again, I believe the train is a metaphor for something much, much deeper.
6,0,0,I am glad we are off-we could have been injured?
6,2,1,When we're finally done overcoming your fear of trains we can start on mine.
4,1,0,Oh well, the five ten should be along in a few minutes!
4,0,0,I lost my train of thought.
5,3,0,Get the selfie stick out.
5,3,0,If it doesn't stop this time, I'm not doing this again.
4,0,0,But, if they do back it up...
4,0,0,The fourth train's the charm.
4,2,0,What do you mean the train has left the station?
5,1,1,This time you are 100 percent sure this was the last train for the night?
4,0,0,I think we have completely derailed.
9,0,0,The good news is that the math is on our side...big time.
5,0,0,On the bright side, we found your ticket!
4,1,0,Well, at least he made the trains run on time.
5,1,0,We want more bathrooms and local stops for all.
4,0,0,How many times do you think we can do this before they call it insurance fraud?
4,1,0,We should have voted for Frank Underwood.
4,0,0,If this doesn't work out, we can try taxi
8,3,4,Well, it looks like our time is about up.
4,0,0,Daniel: That was the worst of times. Oliver: And the best of times!
4,1,0,Too bad our insurance won't pay for a better rehab facility.
4,1,0,Let's keep our recovery on track.
4,0,0,Don't worry, I'll only bill you we survive.
6,2,1,Are you sure this is what the doctor meant by our recovery being on track?
4,0,0,Ah, sweet "D" for disability money.
4,0,0,So Doc, you say dream interpretation is your specialty?
4,0,0,They say if you the same thing a second and expect a different outcome you are crazy!!!!!!
5,1,0,The doctor recommended that I get direct exposure to "D" to increase bone density.
4,1,0,Your anxieties are of a common, yet surprisingly vivid character.
4,1,0,Just finished reading Anna Karenina. I'll text her back.
4,0,0,I've lost all enthusiasm for the 'Low Line Park' idea.
5,2,0,You're lucky you know. You almost hit the third rail setting up your chair.
5,2,0,Dang! There goes the Club Car!
5,3,1,Well, Mr. Brenner, our time is just about up.
5,1,0,Spinal D Compression Traction
4,1,0,Don't worry. We're covered for pre-existing conditions.
5,1,0,Why move? It's an easy commute.
6,0,1,And the definition of insanity is....
5,1,0,I guess this is what they mean by double jeopardy
4,1,0,No better place to be in traction than the tracks.
6,1,2,In London they say, "Mind the gap." In New York they don't say nothin'.
5,2,0,Doc, professionally speaking, is this dream a metaphor for my life, my marriage, or what?
4,0,0,It's possible that applied behavioral therapy is not the right approach for you.
4,1,0,Retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be.
4,0,0,No, Mr. Coleman, I don't think 'trainwreck' is the right metaphor.
4,0,0,Next stop is heartache.
4,0,0,Train Man's Holiday
4,0,0,Getting to the roller coaster is half the fun.
4,0,0,Don't worry, it's self-driving.

5,2,0,Oh come on! What are the odds of the same thing happening twice in the same week?
5,2,0,We'll be fine, it's the D train it'll be out of service for at least an hour.
7,2,2,Now that we've conquered your fear of skydiving, let's work on your fear of trains!
4,0,0,Did you check the train schedule?
5,2,0,I love life on the fast track.
4,0,0,I thought it would never come.
4,0,0,When I said "Subway" I was actually referring to my roaring belly
7,1,2,When I asked you to help me delve into my sub-conscious, I think you misunderstood.
5,0,0,That was a tough crowd at the Trump Rally!
5,1,0,Aversion therapy is incredibly relaxing.
4,1,0,That car sure came out of nowhere.
4,0,0,Like you, I'm always bowled over by trains...
5,1,0,Two laid off train inspectors
6,4,1,I must have read the weekend schedule.
4,0,0,Now let's be very clear this time. In your dream, was it a "D" Train that was bearing down on you?
4,1,0,I wish we could get untracked.
4,0,0,Now do you understand, doc?
4,0,0,Well, if lightening does strike twice, at least we'll be comfortable.
5,1,0,Why yes, I am a well trained psychiatrist.
5,3,0,The vibration relieves the itching.
6,1,1,Let's not follow that train of thought this time.
4,1,0,"I told you that we should have taken the "A" Train!
4,0,0,I guess the subway strike is over earlier than you thought.
5,2,0,"Yup, it's the 3:10 right on time".
4,1,0,Yup, we are beside ourselves with itch.
6,0,0,Scooch over. I'll hook on. It won't hurt this time. Promise.
5,0,0,Three minutes late - again!
4,0,0,According to my financial advisor, this is the only I get to retire before 60.
4,0,0,I don't think this is a good palace to rest
4,0,0,So THIS is the Donald's Endlösung.
4,0,0,The D train. Who would have guessed.
5,0,0,Well Priebus , nothing will de-rail our plan for a contested nominee
5,0,0,This is the last time I share your pain.
4,0,0,I still can't believe we got these couches through the turnstiles
4,0,0,Yep, I remember when they took you to a hospital. Sometimes you even got a room.
4,0,0,Let me guess! Pelham 4-5-6?
5,2,0,Uhh, do we have a back-up plan?
4,0,0,I got a feeling that if I live through this session I'm going to be cured.
4,1,0,We can only be pushed so far.
5,3,1,No, I will not trade with you. You had the couch last time.
4,1,0,I think we should have taken the F.
5,2,0,I don't know Doc; it certainly feels real.
4,0,0,I think we got it this time.
6,3,2,Other than some minor loss of peripheral vision, my doctor says I'll make a complete recovery.
4,0,0,Actually, I don't participate in my patients' dreams
8,3,1,I feel like we're really making progress on the definition of insanity thing.
4,0,0,This armchair travel isn't all it's cracked up to be.
6,1,1,It's still better treatment than the VA Hospital.
4,1,0,We really need to find a better way to calculate math questions about moving trains.
4,0,0,Nice to finally relax after all that chaos in the ER.
4,0,0,At least we're not at work.
7,6,4,I believe our time is up.
7,0,2,Do you have Medicare Part D.
5,2,0,Are you sure the doctor wrote T-R-A-C-K-T-I-O-N?
4,0,0,No, really, we have to stop meeting like this.
4,0,0,I thought it might be less painful for us both, if we shifted track away from your mother.
5,1,0,We're retraining your brain.
6,1,1,I was expecting the Q train.
4,0,0,We are back on track.
4,1,0,So it's not a Pullman sleeper....
4,0,0,Here comes the trai......
4,0,0,This should meet my health insurance deductible.
4,0,0,We might be able to make a few quid building Trump's wall after we recover from the derailment of our traditional values.
4,1,0,Do you know what the odds are of getting struck by a train twice are.
4,0,0,Eminent domain can take my land, but never my home!
4,0,0,And sometimes trains through tunnels are trains through tunnels
5,1,0,It's never as bad as you remember.
5,3,0,The sensation you describe is called deja vu.
4,0,0,I told you we were on the wrong side of the tracks.
6,2,1,Don't worry, it doesn't hurt as much the second time around.
4,1,0,It's fine, the circle means it's local.
4,1,0,I can't find the time to relax anymore.
4,0,0,Yes, getting a free ride into the city saves money, but couldn't we just take a cab once in a while?
4,0,0,No problem!" "The A train last week was going at twice the speed!
4,0,0,Maybe this time I'll be lucky.
4,1,0,I suppose it's too late to call 9-1-1.
4,0,0,No one saw the movie either.
4,0,0,the Detrainees in their natural habitat
6,2,1,But you also said the truck was just one of my delusions.
6,0,1,Trust me, this time the video will go viral.
4,0,0,Agreed--still less painful than a Donald Trump presidency.
6,7,4,I see that our time is about up
6,2,1,These sitdown strikes sure have improved.
4,0,0,Now THIS is living.
6,0,1,Normally I use the 'A' train.
6,0,0,Have you made any progress on your fear of subways since our last exposure therapy session?
6,2,1,"'Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon"?
4,1,0,I still prefer this to what's on the networks.
5,4,0,I warned them, see, hit us once shame on you but hit us twice, shame on…. Uh-oh.
4,0,0,At least the government was kind enough to deliver us here.
4,1,0,Nothing is easy, Mitch.
4,0,0,If I could just cast this dilemna into a new light, using a little reverse psychology and not add insult to injury, we could get back on track.
5,3,0,Who's your tort lawyer?
5,4,0,The question we have to ask ourselves is, 'Have we learned anything?'
5,0,0,I told you we would get railroaded with this healthcare plan.
4,0,0,About to get hit wth a "D".
4,1,0,Now, isn't this more exciting than rock climbing?
3,0,0,We should have taken the express the first time around.
4,0,0,You're right. This is much faster than skiing.
4,0,0,I always had a feeling we were from the wrong side of the track's.
6,2,1,Over my dead body.
4,0,0,I guess that was the wrong place for flash therapy.
4,0,0,I assure you round two of treatment will bring a real breakthrough...
4,0,0,That train had a loco motive.
6,0,0,I think these sessions are going right on track.
4,0,0,Dear God, keep us safe...just as you always have. Amen
4,0,0,Are you sure this is part of the High Line?
4,0,0,Don't you think the train engineer is quite disarming?
4,0,0,I get the feeling we're on the wrong track again.
4,0,0,We occupied Wall Street, and we can occupy railroad tracks.
4,1,0,I think we're on the right track, Mr. Carstairs, but token payments will only devalue your progress.
5,2,0,I just don't know if people outside of New York can relate to this.
4,1,0,So we are on the right track.
6,0,1,I told you to be nicer to that nurse.
6,2,1,Shall we pick it up where we left off last week?
4,1,0,I have this recurring dream . . .
4,5,0,They say the best way to recover from trauma is to face it again, head-on.
4,0,0,We really should move our seats.
4,0,0,Yes, I'm sure this is the 'Last Train To Darksville'.
4,0,0,Trust me, I’m a train professional.
7,7,4,I see our time is almost up.
4,1,0,This should finally get us past our insurance deductibles.
4,0,0,When they said virtual reality is like your there. I didn't think they meant like this!!" "We should probably move!
4,0,0,Maybe we should let this train of thought go off-track.
4,0,0,I'm thinking our creator has tunnel vision.
5,0,0,Tragically, Manny and Jack yet again chose the side with wheels.
4,1,0,THIS DIDN'T WORK THE LAST TIME WE TRIED TO GET A FREE RIDE.
5,3,0,My doctor says I'm right on track.
5,2,0,Forget the consequences. It is the principal of the matter. Sure, we may lose another battle, but we will win the war.
6,2,2,Since our last session, would you say your fear of trains has increased or decreased?
5,10,3,I'm afraid I'm still going to have to bill you for the full hour.
6,0,0,You've had your office here, what, seven years now? And I'm the crazy one?
3,0,0,If they don't shut this magazine down for this then we know freedom of the press is still alive and well
5,2,0,Breakthroughs are always painful.
4,0,0,Is this really the only way I can get my therapy covered by flex-pay?
