953,3,14,76,93,1.2150537634408602,0.05035976776967562,560,"Southern exposure, and no water in the basement."
953,3,14,76,93,1.2150537634408602,0.05035976776967562,560,"Dry, sure, but I bet the cell reception is terrible."
953,2,16,75,93,1.2150537634408602,0.04798283150376886,560,"It's easy to get a fancy cave if you live to the ripe old age of 30, but then you're too old to enjoy it."

953,4,12,77,93,1.2150537634408602,0.05262946228598813,560,Since when did they begin a cover charge?

953,5,10,78,93,1.2150537634408602,0.05480524054512337,560,The birth of the man cave

982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,Don’t tell me you’d give up nice digs like ours for a hole in the wall like his.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,"Sure it's appealing, but above-ground living is just a fad."
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,shall we tell him who really lives in that cave
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,He says he's got a bad case of tunnel vision.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,I told you he was gonna cave.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Glerg is about to learn why we are called the clan of the cave bear.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,I'm worried. He's almost never leaves his man cave.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,"As you can see, it is a one bedroom, with a doorman wall paintings, and a great view."
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,What a hole in the wall... Maybe we should have him drop in?
982,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,560,"It's nice, but he'll have to give it up once he's married."
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,Check out the convex arch.
982,0,19,71,90,1.211111111111111,0.04325820177821489,560,Think he'll sell? This housing market is crazy.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,"Yeah, he has more space with the horizontal design but it doesn't seem to have made him any happier."
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,"Trust me, cave-dwelling is just a fad."
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,That is Blargg's new invention--the man cave.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,I warned him. Chicks don't dig caves.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,At least we have a 360 degree view!
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,And this is what a five star rating looks like?
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,He doesn't want to lose his caveman identity.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,I don't know. It never occurred to me to live above ground.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,He's struggling with his post-paleolithic style.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,So that's what penthouse living is like.
982,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,560,I just don't think living with a roof over your head is going to catch on.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,I'm so sorry I married you. Our house is a hole compared to your brother's.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Maybe he's on to something.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,"So sad, Vlad left and still no Godot."
982,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,560,That's the trouble with modern architecture - No privacy.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,"If you can afford all that, I’m pretty sure you can afford to pay someone to clean it."
982,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,560,He's got a mammoth case of writer's block.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,At least WE know the difference between a tunnel and a hole in the ground!
982,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,560,Wait until the HOA hears about this...
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,...and it's rent controlled.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,Seems lightly guarded for such priceless art.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,"When it's finished, this will be the 86th street stop."
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,I can't help but feeling envious of those who own luxury holes
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,"What a concept, a horizontal hole."
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,"I'm fine with fire and the wheel, but the invention of the bouncer is getting me down."
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,"Hmm. Modern, yet functional."
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,Make up your mind; hole in the wall or hole in the ground.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,"Don't be fooled, He didn't earn that. It's all family money."
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,"We may be in a starter hole now, but there is our future."
982,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,560,It's just too long a stretch for him to see the light at the end of our tunnel.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,He's teaching us that we don't know our ass from a hole in the ground.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,Just wait for the next market crash and we'll get that place for a couple of beaver pelts.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,"Sure, I'd like a roof, but not at those Brooklyn prices."
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,I don't know how he can afford the rent.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,He prefers a hole-in-the-wall.
982,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,560,He's watching jurassic park again.
982,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,560,I wonder if he's thinking about the days before America became great again.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Just what this neighborhood needs -- another cave.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Our hole is rent-controlled.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,Isn’t it about time he hunted and gathered?
982,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,560,"Well, so much for your China theory."
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,Modern architects are so smug.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,"He's already invented fire and the wheel, I'm sure he can come up with a way for us to get out of this hole."
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Gentrification is just killing our neighborhood.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,I could never stand to be cooped up like that.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,That's one of those new prefab homes.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,"Yes, it's strange, but at least his feet are dry."
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Don't you love his embrace of minimalism.
982,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,560,Do you think this is China?
982,8,3,79,90,1.211111111111111,0.06219947863272956,560,He's still tweeting that the button he pushed said LUNCH instead of LAUNCH..
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,One final obstacle between us and the Bronze Age.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Now that’s a man cave.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,We probably shouldn't have unfriended him
982,1,17,72,90,1.211111111111111,0.04605388052294923,560,"Living in a cave, what will they think of next?"
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,Aren't you proud that our son has moved up in the world?
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Do you think your parents will let us move in with them?
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,I see he went with the open door plan.
982,6,7,77,90,1.211111111111111,0.05804652756116187,560,I guess he didn't find China either.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,He just found out that he's been living under a rock.
982,5,9,76,90,1.211111111111111,0.0558543773734109,560,He's watching reruns of the Flintstones.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,I feel like he might be onto something?
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,Just because he could put a dry roof over your head makes him a better man than me?
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,How much for that hole in the wall?
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,He says he is not going to come out until the next election.
982,3,13,74,90,1.211111111111111,0.05118921460128822,560,Cave dwelling will never catch on.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,He neither hunts nor gathers after the accident.
982,2,15,73,90,1.211111111111111,0.04868929863285577,560,What's his problem? He's got way more space than we do.
982,4,11,75,90,1.211111111111111,0.05357260103480199,560,He's said he's pretty sure the CIA can't bug him here.
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,That's Og Trump in his first high rise.

1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,He can't decide whether to evolve or just be another missing link.

1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,It looks like another case of affluenza.
1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,He's turning into such a cave potato.

1062,6,6,75,87,1.206896551724138,0.05926108993373639,560,"All I said was ""You still think he is going to make America great again?"" and he stormed off."
1062,1,16,70,87,1.206896551724138,0.04664049472641468,560,He doesn't get it. Cave dwelling is history.
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,"See honey, not every neighbor's hole goes into the ground."
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,We may never be grandparents.

1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,"It's spacious, but I bet he's swimming in debt."
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,"if he's waiting for the cows to come home, he's out of luck - they were delicious!"
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,"Only one word to describe this Wilma, gentrification."
1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,"I'm thinking White Pickett Fence, what are you thinking?"
1062,5,8,74,87,1.206896551724138,0.05696111457628315,560,For next year's vacation let's spring for the cave upgrade.
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,Geez! So that's why beans aren't part of the Paleo Diet!
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,Caves are SO ten thousand years ago.
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,A concierge! Must be the new thing with these highrises
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,"Man cave, it will never catch on."
1062,1,16,70,87,1.206896551724138,0.04664049472641468,560,He's lucky because its under rent control.
1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,Nice man cave.
1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,We definitely need to move up in the world.
1062,1,16,70,87,1.206896551724138,0.04664049472641468,560,Man. Cave. Man cave.
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,I've become a whole man thanks to you.
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,I knew we shouldn't have bought the floor model.
1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,Smart. Him make side hole.
1062,5,8,74,87,1.206896551724138,0.05696111457628315,560,The party ended an hour ago and he's still here...
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,Moog wait to see how health care turn out before Moog go hunt.
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,I told him I would feed him to the T. Rex if I ever caught him drawing on the walls again.
1062,1,16,70,87,1.206896551724138,0.04664049472641468,560,Frankly I don't see the difference between a hole in the ground and a hole in a wall.
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,Beware: he's calling it a 'man-cave' and inviting women to see his etchings.
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,He's trying to make caves great again.
1062,5,8,74,87,1.206896551724138,0.05696111457628315,560,"It's nice, but I wouldn't want to live in a high-rise."
1062,5,8,74,87,1.206896551724138,0.05696111457628315,560,I hear he's stepping down as cartoon editor. About time don't you think?
1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,"Babe, I gotta get me a man-cave."
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,one percent.
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,He did say it was near the subway.
1062,2,14,71,87,1.206896551724138,0.049423111543959376,560,"Sure, but he doesn't have an in-ground pool."
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,One really is the loneliest number
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,I'd be a caveman if my dad left me eight spears.
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,He's so bourgeois.
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,I hate this now.
1062,0,18,69,87,1.206896551724138,0.04368097459950705,560,"I'm not saying his is better, it's just different."
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,"Trust us, horizontal caves are soo last century."
1062,5,8,74,87,1.206896551724138,0.05696111457628315,560,Nice man cave.
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,"Well yeah, it's a bit smelly, but just look at all the space! I'm told he even has his own private outhouse hole somewhere around here."
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,"Bob's on a strict Paleo Diet, he can't even leave the cave."
1062,1,16,70,87,1.206896551724138,0.04664049472641468,560,Look--it's the home we always wanted!
1062,3,12,72,87,1.206896551724138,0.052057200856832346,560,Ha! Above ground living never catch on.
1062,5,8,74,87,1.206896551724138,0.05696111457628315,560,Artist.
1062,6,6,75,87,1.206896551724138,0.05926108993373639,560,I told him a hole with two is just as good as a hole in one
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,I'm going to have to kill 2 more dinosaurs a week before we can afford to live like THAT!
1062,1,16,70,87,1.206896551724138,0.04664049472641468,560,"If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I can't see it"
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,We will just tell him the truth. We're his long lost cousins from the land down under.
1062,5,8,74,87,1.206896551724138,0.05696111457628315,560,"Well, I'll be damned."
1062,4,10,73,87,1.206896551724138,0.054564277392910844,560,These zoning variances are ruining the quaintly primitive nature of our community
1132,3,8,57,68,1.2058823529411764,0.061295723573926195,560,He's better at hunting than hiding
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,They say he came into money
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,"Made his fortune as a gatherer. His cave is luxurious--high ceilings, a skylight and an original painting by Og."
1133,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,560,That's brilliant.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,Singing the subterranean homesick blues.
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,A cozy studio with tons on natural light.
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,I hope that one day we too can move to a hole in the wall.
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,"Sure it's big, but can you imagine the rent?"
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,See. There is a wait. I told you that you should have gone before we left
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,He knows how to sit with his arms crossed--I'll give him that.
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,Gentrification. What a shame.
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,"Grok moved in there yesterday and is now calling himself a ""cave"" man - like a cave could ever be better than a hole."
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,He saved 15% on his car insurance then forgot to invent the wheel.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,"Oh he's just acting like a big, fat Neanderthal."
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,He's binge-watching again!
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,"As you can see, our facility offers a totally immersive Paleo experience"
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,I've heard its somehow waterproof!
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,His mother put him in time out for dragging his sister around by the hair.
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,He said he needed some time in his Man Cave.
1133,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,560,I don't get it either...something about it being a better investment.
1133,2,11,62,75,1.2,0.05369248441712195,560,It wasn't me who refused to live in some hole in the wall.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,Cave Man? What's that?
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,I hope voyerism gets better in the future.
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,You sure you see light at the end of the tunnel?
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,He just wants to be known as a 'Caveperson'.
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,"When he moves, we are definitely upgrading."
1133,5,7,73,85,1.2,0.05749193098906611,560,What's a menage a trois?
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,Now that's what I call living it up.
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,"How ingenious, a caveman man cave!"
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,"Pretty soon, this whole valley will be gentrified with caves."
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,He wanted a room with a view.
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,"To tell the truth, I don't understand why you moved in with me, either."
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,Look at Homo Dejectus over there.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,"Honey, you don't want to have the most expensive house on the block."
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,"Grog seems like a good neighbor, but I can't shake the feeling that he's looking down on us."
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,Maybe if we're nice he'll let us come over and watch his wall.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,Think he's checking IDs?
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,"Wow, and all the amenities that go with above-ground living!"
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,I was sure we'd come up in China
1133,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,560,To me it looks just like another hole in the wall
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,His cave dwelling idea is definitely cutting edge.
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,Do we tell him about Plato?
1133,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,560,"Sure, bigger is nice, but then you have the commute."
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,Let's make him pay for the tunnel.
1133,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,560,"Yes, but we have each other."
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,You want HIM for a sperm donor?
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,He swore he'd never go in there—then he caved.
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,We should have just paid the toll.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,I positively despise cold calling.
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,Next time maybe you'll believe me when I say we should dig another fifty yards.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,We can't afford the mortgage.
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,Should we tell him that it's just an allegory?
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,Mankoff. He is now available on Thursdays!
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,"Yea, but he won't be happy when the rain blows sideways."
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,That cave thing will never catch on.
1133,1,15,69,85,1.2,0.04674263524428026,560,"If he didn't want us to peep, he would put up drapes."
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,He's looking for love in all the wrong places.
1133,0,17,68,85,1.2,0.04364357804719847,560,Damn progressives.
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,Time out again?
1133,2,13,70,85,1.2,0.04964862530219501,560,"And as soon as we domesticate the dog, he'll be in the dog house."
1133,3,11,71,85,1.2,0.05239368319955837,560,"It's nice, but I'm not ready for another fixer-upper."
1133,4,9,72,85,1.2,0.05500190982169267,560,"Nice guy, but he lives in a hole-in-the-wall."
1133,7,3,75,85,1.2,0.06217351701880306,560,I hate our condo association.
1195,3,7,56,66,1.196969696969697,0.06190336468479953,560,"We crawled into a hole like he said, now what?"
1196,2,12,68,82,1.1951219512195121,0.050409417988450604,560,"See honey, that's the kinda man cave I want."
1196,1,14,67,82,1.1951219512195121,0.047328588608598864,560,I think he's now called a 'caveperson'.

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"He is collecting tolls, but it has been slow."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Ever since he moved into a high-rise he's been so full of himself.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Look at this monkey!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,His cave is just not a good fit with the neighborhood.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Would he take half back rent?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,And to think you told me on-demand movies would bring us closer together.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Why won't he join us in our hot tub?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He keeps muttering that he 'liked the shadows better than the puppets.'
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,It's a fox hole. He's vertically challenged.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,They upgraded the security system since we owned the cave.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Will he be glad to see us?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Don't worry. The train doesn't come for 5,000 years."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"If you'd taken a left back there, like I told you, we wouldn't be in this predicament."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Hmm, I will call him ""Neanderthal caveman"" so not to confuse him with us, ""Sapian hole dudes."""
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Those Eloi are looking more like us Morlocks every day.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,How can he live like that?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Maybe he could have kept you if he had faster wi-fi.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Beauty is beneath the surface
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He just sits there all day staring at that new big-cave drawing.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,At least our place has the same walk score.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"C'mon, don't be a Neanderthal. Take the subway."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,His team lost in the Big Dance.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Sure, he's got the fanciest cave on the block, but since Marnie left, he's lost his sparkle."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Grug's guest cave is somewhat lacking.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Me think fire pit too far, and too deep."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I bet no one yet thought of eloping this way.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Didn't you tell him the IRT suspended service on this line?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Do you think that tunnel is safer than a foxhole?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"To heck with ""Take a dive."" Next time I'm goin' back t' good ol' ""Walk the plank!"""
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He doesn't believe that the court said he CAN come in!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Distant times call for distant measures.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,We should just forget it - we won't sway him away from Trump.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Look, someone caved and bought the place next door! Did you know it doubles as a pizza oven?"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Don't worry darling, the 'caveman' will never catch on."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He is god--sits on his hole!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I can't believe she left here for the hole she now calls home.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,See? He has a mancave and all I have this manhole.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,yes he has his own cave but does he have a wheel?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"How many more days of ""sharing economy"" before we get our cave back?"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I am going to miss the brontosaurus steaks!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I'm certain the holemen legacy will live on past this.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,The great genius! He wouldn't be staring at that wall painting if he didn't know we were looking at him.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"""Alternative cave,"" yeah, right."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He doesn’t care… recall… impeach…alien takeover… whatever. Then he’s coming out.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I thought he'd be into it.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Goodbye, Mister I'm too good for the dinosaur shelter"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,So he lives in a hole in the wall upper West...we got a den babe!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Available housing has significantly decreased since he became HUD Secretary. We'd all be better off if he stuck with brain surgery.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,These end of the world enactments are now getting old- he's just taken up yodeling
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He can't stand bridge and tunnel people.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"If we're going to be the world's first private eyes, we're really going to have to invest in some bug-proof under-hides."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"If he asks of your whereabouts, invent some tall tale of wiretapping and foreigners taking away his job, that'll get him all riled up!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Some say, he spends weeks at a time looking at that thing."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,We'll outnumber him tomorrow. Today is a 'Day Without a Woman'.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,xxx
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He was mugged on the subway by a mammoth.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,When does fashionably late morph into outright rudeness?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,We're watching him from a hole in the ground and he looks mad about it.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"It's a hole in a wall, but it looks like an improvement."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Careful. Grok doesn’t know if he’s cometh or goeth.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He wants a serene life in a monastic way.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Slim pickings this singles night.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He deconstructed the administrative state.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,This must be the famous cave at emptor.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Don't be embarrassed, Harvey. We all pee in the hot tub."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Can you believe it, he got the apartment for $1500.00 a month in New Yorker city and it's furnished."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"I'm sorry I had to ditch you Larry, but with this cave girl, you can say I hit a one in a hole"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I think he might be onto something with this cave home idea.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,The horizontal cave shelter will never catch on. Vertical holes are the future.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"And get this, he calls it his ""man-cave""."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"I told you it was a cave, not ""The Cave."" SMH."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,What's with him?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I wanna be in the cave where it happens.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Just because he knows which way to dig, doesn't mean he's a better kisser."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Definitely not Eloi - and I'm getting hungry.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Either he doesn't notice me, or he believes I'm your cousin."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Maybe we should get a pest report before talking to the agent.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Horizontal! Horizontal! Horizontal!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,It's Called a Welcome Hole
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"He's planing the Second Avenue Subway extension to 96th street"""
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"You ask him what went went too far last night, he's your husband."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He's living in the moment to he whole. I'd rather live in a hole to be safe.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"There's got to be an easier way to rebut his ""holier than thou"" claim."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He went with that new sideways model.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I hate waiting in line for the hot springs.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Your son, the 'Doctor of Anthropology,' has been dormant longer than that volcano."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Is this the way to China?.......I think we took a wrong turn.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Zog is hog.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Nice cave bich
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He says he's waiting for Crocs.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,so who wants to sit anyway?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Let him be, he's working on a new meditative yoga he just learned."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"I know we have cleaner air, no traffic jams, no I.R.S. and all that, but we'll never get to laugh at a Bob Mankoff cartoon."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,To bad it's not the fourth of July.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,How can Snog afford the penthouse?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I hear his soliloquy is fantastic!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Seems, resigned!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Him invent sideways cave. Look lonely, pensive."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Rocco laughed at his stick figure painting.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,You don't think tickling his feet will work this time?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I'll agree on human if he fails the Turing test.

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He just found out that I'm pregnant.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He's too literal for my tastes.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Quickly tell me, what is our quest?"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Hey! is that your brother? you guys look alike.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Finally we can get WiFi
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,There is some room in our volcano shelter.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I want a home like his.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Psst, hurry up and get to heaven before anyone sees you!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I wonder if he'll let us have a VISA?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Bunga trying to invent third wheel.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,The mesozoic bore is back. Let's just cocoon tonight?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Doesn't he know that the ambient ground temperature is 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I think they call this a cone of silence.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"He looks pretty mad, I'm not sure we should tell him about the new volcano escape route."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Hole-y, he sure is moody today"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I can't believe he got through the force field again.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Plus, he pays her four divots a month in alimony."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,His parrot would be proud.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"See, I told you they don't have fire yet."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I wonder what he is thinking!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He's not as interesting as the mating teradactyles.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"I've heard his new dwelling features a new wall treatment he calls ""art."""

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,The A listers are in. Here's our chance...
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,That's not the light at the end of the tunnel. That's Herman the Hopeless.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"We dug the whole, now what!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Funny, he doesn't look Chinese."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Even that guy in the cave knows better than to vote for Trump.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Should we tell him he's better off then us?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Sits all day looking at animal drawings. Calls it is Man Cave.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Let's wait until he gets a pool table.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,It's his safe space.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I'm sorry about your husband. It's just a case of 'Two's company. Three's a crowd.'
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Honey, if deep-thinking narcistic loner is your type, go for him. But make sure you have a job because you will end up having to support him."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"It's not for us, too derivative."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Doesn't he know he's sitting under a bigger volcano?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Jim, I wonder what he is mad about? He looks like he's pouting."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,His hole might be better than ours…?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Hurry up man, nature calls!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Ask him if he has any aspirin.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Look at Tim over there with his boring horizontal cave. Doesn't he know that vertical caves are the latest trend?"""
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He refuses to accept the election results.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"We were digging it and lost track of time, honest."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Stone Age Great Escape--""Gnats! 20 feet short!"""
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,It's one of those new micro-units.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I told him we rather be hole people.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"And he kept saying, if we let him stay in the cave, we could have a hut over our heads."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I say we do a forward roll.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,That's like the wolf guarding the hen house
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"We're done here, but the bidet won't be delivered till next week."

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,They call him Hermit of the Rocks.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He's not like us. He thinks tunnels must be horizontal.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"So far he's only got ""T-U-N-N"" and he's not quite happy with that."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Do you think his place comes with a shower?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"What's with his ""holier than thou"" attitude - I just said three's a crowd."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He keeps calling us immigrants.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"He can't decide: ""White House or ""Executive Mansion""."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"So he's not a fan of, 'three's a crowd'?"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"He said windows have better curb appeal than cold sand, whatever that means."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,You're his muse.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Everything was fine until Jones moved in.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Wow, its like back to the future!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,It's perfect. Bill always was a caveman and Hillary can hide out.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Okay, Brarg, you can get in the hole too - dont be a cave baby."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Our pronunciation at sentencing could probably use some improvement.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Does he have to be the third wheel?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"""Your father seems peaceful...think he'd like a foot massage?"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Well of course I recognize it's an oedipal cry for attention with all its Freudian undertones. But I still contend he'll be warmer and drier when Ukko God of Storms brings for the white flakes of rain.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He gets mad when I go crater-hopping.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Whatya think? Is he gonna ""Love it or List It?"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Why does our chief have to ask the Great Spirit if we can mate?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I still say he's a threat to society.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He should use GEICO
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Now I can say vestibule is not perfect for a 60"" LED!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Oook think Gog maybe one up Oook - man cave more better than man hole.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,You were the one who said let's live next to the Joneses.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He told me he was a hermit
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He said he's given up his spear for good and its ...and its vegan for all of us from now on.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Do you think he is boycotting ""Beauty and The Beast"" or Starbucks?"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Do you think he is still mad at us?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,We should have gone with the open floor plan model.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Why does he always take things so literally?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Your new life with me is gonna be first class caves all the way, not that bum's low rent hole-in-the-wall."

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He'll her over it.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He was awarded the Pritzker for digging horizontal caves.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,should we ask him to join us
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"But, hey. Wait a second. That's not a red canoe."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Shittiest Neolithic Fashion Week yet.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Looks like fun. Me join him. You bring snacks and then go away.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I sure looks lonely at the top.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,That looks like a grizzly place to take a knap.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He's been sulking in there ever since Drumpf was elected!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"He's one of those stubborn literalists: 'I'm a CAVEman, dammit!'"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He found his link.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Well, sure, these horizontal holes are great at keeping the rain out but there's no way he's going to trap a mammoth."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He is trying to think how to finish this outdoor jacuzzi !
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He's just not a deep thinker.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I'm glad tweeting hasn't been invented yet.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He says he won't come out until Melania comes back to D.C.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He found the wrong hole.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He still thinks we're going to cave in.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,He's a Home-owner Sapien.

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Now he's just being a jerk.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Aye, a scurvy low degree of difficulty."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,The pop ups won't go away!
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I understand he has geothermal heating.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Well, he wanted to be president."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"I know our place is a shithole, but he'd better stop using it as a shit hole!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,How much do you think the down payment on one of those is?
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Tarik, when we bought this pace at auction the County said it was uninhabited!"
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"Sure, he looks happy, but I just feel more grounded."
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I like an entrance with a Louis Sullivan inspired arch. Forget that he's not born yet.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Maybe he was born since the Cold War and is confused about what shelter means.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,"""Ned, the neighbor, looks like he's in a crabby mood again!?"

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I don't want to be a part of your bomb shelter no matter how much you grunt.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,You run in and distract him and I'll high-tail it out of here.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,If he sees us together he's going to go all caveman.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,His character is a real stretch from his previous roles.

3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,I heard rumours of this neighborhood being gentrified.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,She went 'gathering' a month ago.
3696,0,1,31,32,1.03125,0.031750031750047626,560,Getting $60 million for that book wasn't such a big deal after all.
