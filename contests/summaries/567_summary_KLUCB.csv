318,5,22,73,100,1.32,0.05663992238766581,567,Do you believe me now when I say I'm a stand-up guy?
326,7,17,74,98,1.316326530612245,0.060846367247508235,567,I told you I could do this job in my sleep.
326,4,23,71,98,1.316326530612245,0.05541750716194502,567,"Could you get out of my dream,sir?"

326,5,21,72,98,1.316326530612245,0.05728432190197447,567,"What do you want from me? I'm up, aren't I?"
326,3,25,70,98,1.316326530612245,0.05348557435719861,567,Well you won't let me work from home!
333,8,14,74,96,1.3125,0.06337112215202614,567,I'm not inclined to agree with you.
333,6,13,61,80,1.3125,0.06795789370231906,567,I suppose you're also going to get all bent out of shape about the bedpan in my briefcase.
333,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,567,It's my emotional support mattress.
333,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,567,Work-life balance is tricky.
333,6,18,72,96,1.3125,0.0598105561885103,567,And why'd you think I slept through the meeting?
333,7,16,73,96,1.3125,0.061616563334812684,567,You mind getting the door? I left my ID in my pull-out sofa.
333,5,20,71,96,1.3125,0.05794829062159566,567,Don't knock it. I'm finally going to get my dream job.

341,6,17,71,94,1.3085106382978724,0.060552243400987533,567,I decided to take their offer and wait for the next flight.

341,3,23,68,94,1.3085106382978724,0.054591504674966845,567,I said I could do this job in my sleep.
341,4,21,69,94,1.3085106382978724,0.0566481507384142,567,It's where I have my best ideas.

341,7,15,72,94,1.3085106382978724,0.062412777380097484,567,"I want a new contract. This bed sucks, the coffee's cold, and you're looking very judgey right now."
341,7,15,72,94,1.3085106382978724,0.062412777380097484,567,"Murphy, if this is some kind of a practical joke..."
341,9,11,74,94,1.3085106382978724,0.0659766320685434,567,This whole work life balance thing is getting out of hand.
341,8,13,73,94,1.3085106382978724,0.06421943148068798,567,"Oh, you wanted me to dive into the balance sheets."
341,6,17,71,94,1.3085106382978724,0.060552243400987533,567,"Then why is it called Bed, Bath and Beyond??"
341,8,13,73,94,1.3085106382978724,0.06421943148068798,567,"Sorry, I am late. Took me an hour to kick my wife out of bed this morning."
341,2,25,67,94,1.3085106382978724,0.052454282792463724,567,"It was fine for Sheryl in accounting, but now it's a problem if I sleep my way to the top?"

341,4,21,69,94,1.3085106382978724,0.0566481507384142,567,You're not supposed to wake someone who's sleepworking.
341,5,19,70,94,1.3085106382978724,0.058632700615674084,567,It's called a power nap
370,2,24,66,92,1.3043478260869565,0.05295638758311849,567,"Look it's either this, or I work from home."
370,6,16,70,92,1.3043478260869565,0.06131839168480321,567,Sorry I'm late sir. I got caught in the turnstile.

377,5,17,68,90,1.3,0.06006654653369374,567,You told me to sleep on it.
377,4,19,67,90,1.3,0.05795085954795724,567,"A spineless lawyer, perhaps, but prove the lazy part!"

396,7,11,68,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06588610798684778,567,"Because you said you wanted me to take ""working from home"" to a whole new level."
396,6,13,67,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06377602538914648,567,A little help here. Mom tucked me in tight.
396,6,13,67,86,1.2906976744186047,0.06377602538914648,567,I told you this was my dream job.

396,3,19,64,86,1.2906976744186047,0.05697883800837401,567,"When I said I wanted to work from home, It didn't mean I wanted to live at the office."

396,5,15,66,86,1.2906976744186047,0.061593697755692074,567,I got the idea on that flight from Hong Kong.
396,2,21,63,86,1.2906976744186047,0.05452513337505023,567,You told me to adjust my work/life balance!
418,4,16,64,84,1.2857142857142858,0.06005215884396798,567,And I remember the days when we started work at 9:00 and were finished at 5:00........
418,6,12,66,84,1.2857142857142858,0.0646528054078931,567,"You can't fire me, I quilt!"
418,6,12,66,84,1.2857142857142858,0.0646528054078931,567,I'm transitioning to decaf.
418,3,18,63,84,1.2857142857142858,0.05761423477905696,567,What do you mean I don't look well rested?
418,5,14,65,84,1.2857142857142858,0.06239489974722314,567,I work 24 hours a day and you couldn't even spring for a sheet?
418,5,14,65,84,1.2857142857142858,0.06239489974722314,567,I thought I'd home at work for a change.
418,4,16,64,84,1.2857142857142858,0.06005215884396798,567,"One word, multitasking."

418,4,16,64,84,1.2857142857142858,0.06005215884396798,567,I'm having trouble getting out of bed.
418,5,14,65,84,1.2857142857142858,0.06239489974722314,567,You happy now? I'm here and it wasn't easy. How are we supposed to go on without Mankoff?
428,4,15,63,82,1.2804878048780488,0.06079467282974136,567,It eliminates down time.
428,1,21,60,82,1.2804878048780488,0.05284552845528457,567,Stop accusing me of lying down on the job.
428,4,15,63,82,1.2804878048780488,0.06079467282974136,567,I didn't want to take a sick day.
431,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,567,"I'm bed-ridden, Jeremy, not an invalid!"
431,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,567,"Because my creative impulses come to me in my dreams, that's why!"
431,5,12,63,80,1.275,0.06407817614623443,567,"Okay, find your own way to stop having 'naked in public' dreams."
431,4,14,62,80,1.275,0.0615593775311716,567,My name is Jim and I'm a workaholic.

768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,These are the Mondays of our lives.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,I am at the office!!
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,I slept on it and still feel I'm right!
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,My wife got tired of me bringing work to bed.
768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,I never get up on the wrong side of the bed.
768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,"I appreciate your efforts to make me feel more at home sir, but I can't work like this... I'm going to need a refill on the coffee. would a muffin be to much to ask for?"
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,"The subway was running late, and then I lost my wife in the crowd!"

768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,"The doctor said ""more sleep or more work; you can't do both."" Well, I'm going to show her she was wrong."
768,5,2,50,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07810747890850837,567,This is why I hate hospital corners.
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,"You know, working from home's not all it's cracked up to be."
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,Now do you believe I can multi-task?
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,You won't believe the power nap I just had!
768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,You call this economy first class?
768,5,2,50,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07810747890850837,567,It's not just women who can have it all.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,You got something against multi-tasking!
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,I hear there's no work-life balance here.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,"Hey boss, I'm just trying to think outside the boxspring!"
768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,The doctor told me not to get out of bed.
768,4,4,49,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07398791688784717,567,I just can't seem to get anything done in my new posturepedic mattress.
768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,believe me the self-driving bed is going to be the next big thing
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,"This way, I just get up and go."
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,But this is how I got promoted at my last job...
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,It was either go to sleep or go to work. I couldn't decide.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,You'll love this matrass. It works vertically as well as horizontally.
768,4,4,49,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07398791688784717,567,With each of our exclusive stand-up mattresses you get a free can of olives or a slightly-used attache case
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,"If I should die before I wake, I pray The LORD this job to take."
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,Sorry I'm late. I slept past my subway stop.
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,And then I read the research that it doesn't pay to get out of bed.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,I overslept and couldn't find my pants!
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,"It's a lumbar support, and my doctor says I need it 24/7."
768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,I couldn't find my pants.
768,4,4,49,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07398791688784717,567,I am protesting the night shift.
768,4,4,49,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07398791688784717,567,I told you I couldn't get out of bed this morning. Now are you happy?
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,I can never get a cab in this town.
768,3,6,48,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06962503450169975,567,Listen.. I'm just as sick of this dream as you are.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,"Well, if you can't find the solvent, can you at least get me a latte?"
768,4,4,49,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07398791688784717,567,"""Incorrect usage of synergy"" was poor constructive criticism, in my opinion, Bob."
768,1,10,46,57,1.2105263157894737,0.05995425420504103,567,It was supposed to be a standing desk.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,"Look, I don't know why you're so mad. It's casual Friday but I still wore a tie anyway."
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,Wake me when this bus gets to 42nd street.
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,"Wait, why am I fired again?"
768,2,8,47,57,1.2105263157894737,0.06496983156298607,567,Dumb question. You can see what I'm doing.
768,4,4,49,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07398791688784717,567,You should see me play golf!
768,4,4,49,57,1.2105263157894737,0.07398791688784717,567,"I had a bad dream, Russell. Take care of it!"
819,2,5,36,43,1.2093023255813953,0.07845503988508755,567,And I think you're mad because you didn't think of it first.
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,You told me to bring my call sheets...
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,The standing desks were your idea.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"I told you, we are not ready to get in bed with your company yet!!"

820,4,3,48,55,1.2,0.07521014330903548,567,"I said half-soy with extra foam, Geoffrey!"
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,She replaced my lube with super glue.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,I can't seem to find a balance.
820,0,11,44,55,1.2,0.05443310539518172,567,"I said I couldn't get out of bed, but I didn't say I wouldn't be to work!"
820,4,3,48,55,1.2,0.07521014330903548,567,"It's an accommodation, I switched to decaf yesterday."
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,Just living the dream!
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"So I said to the guy on the subway, ""Yeah? well, you're man spreading."""
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,I'm downsizing.
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,I'm not wearing any pants
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Better than the dream that I am naked
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,didn't you hear? its bring your bed to work day
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Me? Sleeping on the job?
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,What makes you think I'm looking to retire?
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,Just trying to follow my dreams
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,Slacking? I'm working 24/7.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"Yes, as a matter of fact I DO think this is a Holiday Inn!"
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Shhhh! I'm sleepworking.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Well you told me to try something more laid back.
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,At least I got to work early.
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,"In my defense the rules for ""Casual Friday"" were rather vague."
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,Well I'm president of the room and board.
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,What makes you think I've been laying down on the job?
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"Sorry I'm late. I had a hard time getting in the car, okay?"
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,The board will regret not funding my commuter bed.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,You said you wanted someone who can multitask!
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,I expect to save 158 hours and 46 minutes over my lifetime.
820,4,3,48,55,1.2,0.07521014330903548,567,I told them my sleep number was 24-7
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,"Don't just stand there, go find my pants!"
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,"Yes, narcolepsy is a real thing. And I'm dealing with it."
820,4,3,48,55,1.2,0.07521014330903548,567,Too casual? It's Friday!
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,"I told the boss I'm confirned to bed, but..."
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Do you know how hard it is to find a strange bedfellow these days?
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Your choice - I get to work on time with the bed or I'm late without the bed.
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,Sleeping on the job? What makes you think I've been sleeping on the job?
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,"No coffee, no luggage rack, and housekeeping never came to turn down the bed."
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Did you check the credentials of those efficiency consultants before you hired them?
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,I keep telling the maid she tucks the covers in too tight.
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,You're the one who said sleep on it
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"H.R.'s dress code stipulates, and I quote, 'comfortably formal.'"

820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,Fired? For over sleeping? Don't expect me to take this lying down!
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,I could do this job in my sleep.
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,I realize Mr Harper frowns on telecommuting so here I am
820,0,11,44,55,1.2,0.05443310539518172,567,Treadmill desks are passe. I'm into occasional naps.
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,"Tempting offer, but let me sleep on it."
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,"The pay is great, but the job is a nightmare!"
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,I thought I was agreeing to the company's early retirement plan.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"And then he says, 'Jobbing on the sleep, again?'"
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,Why do I have to test the beta model?

820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,I'm a Millennial. I shouldn't have to get out of bed to work.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"I only promised you ""I'd sleep on it and get back to you""."

820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,It works better than a Varidesk.
820,3,5,47,55,1.2,0.0705915362006309,567,You were the one who said we were going to the mattresses on this deal.
820,1,9,45,55,1.2,0.060302268915552716,567,But the recruiter told me your company has a very laid-back culture.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,I spilled the bottle of Viagra on the mattress last night.

820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,Sorry I'm late. I had a little trouble getting out of bed this morning.
820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,I'm having a nightmare of a workday.

820,2,7,46,55,1.2,0.06564879518897745,567,"I’m sorry, but I just don’t have any wiggle room."
820,0,11,44,55,1.2,0.05443310539518172,567,You said it was breakfast meeting.

899,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,567,What do you mean you're sending me to Sexual Harassment Training?
899,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,567,I am trying to make Mondays easier.

899,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,567,My sleep number is zero; why?
899,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,567,So what. I slept my way to the top.
899,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,567,Do I complain on take your child to work day?
899,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,567,I feel like the walking bed.
899,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,567,"Look, it's an all-day meeting. I'm just prepared for the inevitable."
899,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,567,If you're going to screw me I might as well be in bed.
899,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,567,I dreamt I was commuting to work and here I am.
899,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,567,The stand-up desk is so 2016.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,Doctor says I'm on bedrest for a few weeks
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,What do you mean 'this constitutes sexual harassment'?

911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,I'm done with this spreadsheet.
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,"Instead of working from home, I'm sleeping from work."
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,They say dress for the job you want.
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,I flew in on the red-eye.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,The hotel was overbooked so they dragged me here.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,I'm dressing for the job I want.

911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,My doctor ordered a full eight hours.
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,Find an Uber that does do mattresses!

911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,The hardest part of the flight was the luggage carousel!
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,Excuse me. You've never heard of Take Your Bed to Work Day?
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,But this is my dream job.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,I rest my case.

911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,I earned my MBA at night school.

911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,It's called sleep working. Get over it.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,"No, Brian, I said I wanted to get into the Grateful Dead; not the hateful bed."
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,You said to dress for the job I want.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,What?! So I take a little home to work with me.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,"OK, I won't expense the pillow."
911,0,10,42,52,1.1923076923076923,0.055186927229187645,567,I'm your man 24/7.
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,Can't I just dance outside with the sign?

911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,In case my flight is overbooked.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,This is the new staycation.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,Sorry I'm late. My morning routine is out of sequence.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,Can't you see I've been working 24-7 on this project?

911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,and she said I couldn't multitask
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,What? I did my college online. Why cant I show up to work in my bed?
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,You try working the night shift and see if YOU like it!
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,"Dude, I'm so tired I could fall asleep standing up."
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,"In this business you're either a sheep, or another sheep, or another sheep..."
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,A fitted sheet would have been appreciated.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,Now push me over and get back to work.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,I don't like your bedside manners.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,What do you mean the Sleep-at-Work model is a horrible idea?
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,"As soon as I go to bed, all of my best ideas come to me. I thought ""Why not dress for it?"""
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,Who put me in sleep mode?
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,It's called multi-tasking.
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,It was this or give up sleep altogether.
911,5,0,47,52,1.1923076923076923,0.08256110465501515,567,"One carry on, one item. What's the problem?"
911,0,10,42,52,1.1923076923076923,0.055186927229187645,567,"Finally, I have found my dream job."
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,I take my eggs over easy.
911,3,4,45,52,1.1923076923076923,0.07285629949368606,567,It's called a work-life balance!
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,Ah...that's why the seatbelt was so tight this morning.
911,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,567,I'm having this crazy dream and you're in it.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,Good Grief! Management has now infiltrated my nightmares
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,But I'm too sick to get out of bed!
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,You should have seen the looks I got on the elevator.
911,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,567,"I hope you don't need an immediate answer on that promotion, Jack. I'd really like to sleep on it a day or two."
911,0,10,42,52,1.1923076923076923,0.055186927229187645,567,My sleep number is 0
976,2,6,45,53,1.1886792452830188,0.06629640403806238,567,Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed!
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,"If you think this looks bad, you should see the other guy!"
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,Doc says I must reduce work stress and spend more time in bed.
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,What? You're the one who said you wanted us to multitask.
976,4,2,47,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07646301065382784,567,You're accusing me of sleeping on the job?
976,1,8,44,53,1.1886792452830188,0.060576594353292317,567,"So, okay. I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning."
976,2,6,45,53,1.1886792452830188,0.06629640403806238,567,I call it extreme multitasking.
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,I refuse to take work home with me.
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,So what? You never have days when you just don't want to get out of bed?
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,It's tough being a stand-up comic in a bed and breakfast.
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,"Look, I work, eat, and sleep for this company. Could I at least get ten minutes to take a shower?"
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,So this is a B&B to go.
976,1,8,44,53,1.1886792452830188,0.060576594353292317,567,Doctor's orders.
976,1,8,44,53,1.1886792452830188,0.060576594353292317,567,Does it look like I'm sleeping on the job?
976,2,6,45,53,1.1886792452830188,0.06629640403806238,567,I've finally achieved work-life balance.
976,2,6,45,53,1.1886792452830188,0.06629640403806238,567,I booked a bed and breakfast.
976,2,6,45,53,1.1886792452830188,0.06629640403806238,567,A perfect complement to my stand up desk.
976,3,4,46,53,1.1886792452830188,0.07156048206456342,567,It's my Murphy office!
976,2,6,45,53,1.1886792452830188,0.06629640403806238,567,"And then my wife said, ""you're taking this sleep study WAY too serious""."
976,1,8,44,53,1.1886792452830188,0.060576594353292317,567,Do I look rested?
976,0,10,43,53,1.1886792452830188,0.054257113621244524,567,I tell you I will not take being fired lying down!
997,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,567,"Sorry I'm late, there was an incident in the subway!"
997,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,567,It takes 'work from home' to the next level.
997,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,567,"Resting and ready to go, boss."
997,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,567,I heard that sitting at work is killing us.
997,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,567,I'm not a morning person.
997,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,567,I come from a city that never sleeps.
997,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,567,You said I'd get promoted in my dreams.
997,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,567,Standing desks are so passé.
997,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,567,My wife claims that she thought I asked her for a good hard birthday tuck.
997,3,3,44,50,1.18,0.07390009803644321,567,Tell me I can't work from home...
997,1,7,42,50,1.18,0.061875450936307745,567,I woke up on the wrong side of the mattress this morning.
997,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,567,I told you. I'm not a morning person.
997,0,9,41,50,1.18,0.054883922035138685,567,It's a firm mattress !
997,2,5,43,50,1.18,0.06815348823929464,567,"Not Murphy, Murray."

1182,1,5,38,44,1.1590909090909092,0.06456212749550704,567,I told you I wouldn't get out of bed for this again.

1488,1,3,35,39,1.1282051282051282,0.06550424345215436,567,"Well I'm sorry, steward, but my idea of a bed in First Class is a little more horizontal."
1488,0,5,34,39,1.1282051282051282,0.054233552759541476,567,What? You said I could work from home.

1488,1,3,35,39,1.1282051282051282,0.06550424345215436,567,"I'm sorry, boss, but I don't get out of bed for less than a healthcare plan I can actually benefit from."
1488,0,5,34,39,1.1282051282051282,0.054233552759541476,567,Am I too early?

1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,The cleaners lost my pants!
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"We need to talk about our ""sleeping arrangement."" Like most things, you get used to it."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"I have something in my teeth, don't I?"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I know you guys want an early start but this is ridiculous.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"Hey! Don't take me out of my comfort zone, man!"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Last week's trust fall didn't go as well as I had hoped.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,See if they snicker about my bed head now.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I still think flying first class is a bargain.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I'm tired of hearing I got up on the wrong side of the bed.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"I can do it in my sleep, Richard."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Next thing you know we'll all be lounging around in our bath robes.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,But I've solved the problem about what side of the bed is the right side to get out on!
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I came to work in bed which appears to have angered you.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"Now if I could only figure out how to shower, I would never have to leave my bed"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Pants are sooo last week!
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,It used to just be breakfast. Now it's 3 squares and 12 hours on the job. I may never get out of bed.....
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,Those jokers over in HR found out about my narcolepsy.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Mono?
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,Well I mean you have heard of a standing desk right?!
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,What do you mean I'm always lying down on the job?!?
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,Do I look like I slept well????
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,what do you mean the Ambien counters the coffee?
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"It's not my fault, they only had decaf!"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,...But you said you wanted a guy who could stand on his own two feet and be ready for anything
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"I told you, I'm not getting out of bed for that job."
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"It may be a full-size mattress, but I have king-size ideas."
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"If you hire me, I promise I'll work 24/7."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I feel like the Center of the World.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Asleep on the job sir?... Why that's absurd!
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"Mr. Murphy, I see that you are finally ready to work!"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Like it?
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I'm a horizontal man in a vertical world.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"You didn't think I was getting out of bed for this, did you?"
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"Listen Dear, you said ""Get dressed for work."" I did it. What else do you want?"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"I'm OK with cuts to the travel budget, but this is ridiculous!"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I had a little trouble getting out of bed this morning.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"There's no 'out there,' Jerome."
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I'm multi tasking per my employment agreement.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I don't do decaf.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"""Not only do you show great dedication to the company Fred, but you don't even have the slightest 'bed head'!"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I didn't get out of bed for this!
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"Sure, I can work more hours but there's no place for my stuff."
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,Everyone has a different comfort zone.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"But boss, I am the king of multitasking!"
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"Well, I'm still sleeping on it."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Just be glad I wasn't in the bathroom when you called.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"Doc said bed rest, landlord said I still had to pay rent.."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,It rides like a dream.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"Can you believe they wanted me to gate check the mattress? They counted the pillow as my ""personal item"""
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I couldn't quite get out of bed this morning.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,So easy I can do it in my sleep!
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,You call this a perk? I should never have left Google.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I said I wasn't getting out of bed and I meant it.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I'm your new Murphy assistant
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,And there's also a pajama option for weekends.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,The commute was hell this morning.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,The hotel bed sheets were tucked in too damn tight.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"It's all part of the 24/7 MO."""
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,Where are the dog and the paper?
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,What? I thought it was casual Friday
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,You told me you didn't want me working from home.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"I'm rested, got my espresso and your directives in my briefcase and ready to work in my cubicle, what's your problem?"
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,24/7 means 24/7.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"This is how we multi-task in Hypoluxo, Florida."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,Isn't this what going from the bedroom to the boardroom actually means?
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"I'm here on time ready to go, isn't that enough?"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"I'll tell you, this new job is really cushy!"
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I'm a lucid dreamer.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I asked for two sugars.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"The commute was killing me, boss."
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I told you I need paid sick days.
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"Sleep number infinity, baby."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,And that's MY superpower!
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"Yeah, and how do you power nap?"
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I can be a minimalist and still believe in bedside tables.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"I know Tom, no coffee in the bed. You're also not supposed to interrupt nap time."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I'm ready
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"Murphy's Law, Murphy bed. No difference."
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"Jim, I'm wait for an explanation as to why you put a sleeping bag over your mattress."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I'm trying to juggle work and my life.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,This isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said you could work from home
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I believe there IS room for sexual harassment in the workplace.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,I call it the human pocket guard.
1853,1,1,30,32,1.09375,0.0689695906576505,567,"Plus, it has a full autonomous driverless mode."
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,I told you I'd never be late again !
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"I had trouble getting out of bed, OK?"
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,My doctor has confined me to bed. Where's our ten o'clock?
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,What do you mean this doesn't constitute 'work - life balance'!
1853,0,3,29,32,1.09375,0.052351460373382196,567,"Yes, I am tired of this conversation."
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,And they say we're not good at multitasking.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,I never take sick days off.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,i must be dreaming
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,"Take the briefcase and the mug. Otherwise, the airline will charge extra."
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,This IS a dream. Pinch me.
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,"The chocolate caramel was nice, but I requested a standing desk with my turndown service."
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,I'm out the door in 45seconds!
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,"""I'll get out of bed when I'm good and ready! Now let's finish this stupid briefing!"
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,I'm a 24/7 company guy.
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,I used to be a one-man band. I couldn't make a living so I gave in and went corporate.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,I wasn't sleeping on the job!
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,I have a feeling this is not going to make as good a novel.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,Do you know how much I save with Err bnb?
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,Why risk getting out on the wrong side?
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,"You asked me to ""sleep on it!"""
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,"yeah, after last time, you can be sure that I wasn't going to risk getting up on the wrong side of the bed again."
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,So this is your idea of bed and breakfast?
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,He's having a whale of a time with that cat.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,I'm ready for anything that comes along
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,What!? I thought you said it was casual Friday!
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,Why do you keep calling me bed head?
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,No I didn't wake up on the wrong side of the bed this morning!
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,I thought you said I could work from home...
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,What did you expect??? I told you I put that deal to bed last night!
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,"Since the election, I can't get out of bed in the morning."
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,I got lightheaded during baggage pickup.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,"I know how it looks, but I save a lot of time on my commute."
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,Tell me this is all just a bad dream.
1981,0,3,30,33,1.0909090909090908,0.05081972676135885,567,I don't get it! I'm here. I'm ready to go!
1981,1,1,31,33,1.0909090909090908,0.06690727929036247,567,It's hard to get out of bed when you keep bringing me decaf!

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,What's wrong with sleeping your way to the top?
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I'm now working the Huffington shift.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"You know, sleeping is the new smoking."
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"Yes, I'm ready for the 100 hour week!"
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I'm sleeping faster!
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"I told the boss I was analytic, NOT not narcoleptic!"
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It's called a self-sleeping bed. It allows you to work while you sleep.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,You need to change our work from home policy.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I slept in.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,They overbooked.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,So it turns out there are no lay-flat seats on the subway.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I hate 7 AM meetings.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I started it when I became responsible for my own travel expenses.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"You must understand, I have not been sleeping on the job!"
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It's not your turn for an other 15 min.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I'm mad too - I have mattress attachment disorder.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"And, your point is?"
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"I wanted a firm mattress, not a mattress firm."

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Of course it's not all positive.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I stayed in bed for this?!?
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,This is where I come up with all my ideas.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,So I fell asleep in a few meetings. I think this punishment is excessive.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Go ahead... guess the thread count.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,But I still need to incorporate a lavatory.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Stop treating me like a high-priced pocket protector!
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,...and it still can't get any thing done.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It's called Airbnb - spartan but very convenient.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,How can you say I'm homeless? This is my home.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Because it's the only way to get anything done in this sweatshop of an office.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It's the best sleep I've ever had at work.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It was impossible on the subway.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,There was no right side today.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,And you thought you got me out of bed.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It's the next best thing to working from home.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Turning in like this saves 17 point 4 minutes in the morning.

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,This is a really lame sleepaway camp.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"Mr. Murphy, why don't you get me out of YOUR bed?!"
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,You can't tell me I got off the wrong side of the bed.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,What's your problem? I cut out two and a half hours off my commute this way!
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,So I can't work from home ?
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,This time maybe I'll get some sleep on the train.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"I'm here aren't I!, What more do you want??"
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,You sure this will cure my insomnia?
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I can do this job in my sleep!
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Sales pitch? Yes sirree! Murphy's the name. Easy get-up-and-go beds my game.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I asked room service to get me up.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"Yes, I get it. Cover the Asian markets. But there has to be some give and take."

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,But you said demonstrate some work/life balance!
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"The Turtle Mattress is so comfortable, you'll wear it everywhere. With this TV offer, you get the cup, pillow, and briefcase free."
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,So where's my breakfast?
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,So what if I sleep on the job?
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Your dress code didn't say anything about beds.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I said decaf. This coffee is keeping me up.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"Comes in really handy during long, boring meetings."
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"Well, it IS raining and it IS Monday."
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I knew working from home was a bad idea.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"You call this a ""sleeper seat?"
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,When I'm finally gone I don't want anyone to say he always wished he had spent more time at the office.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"OK, so it's not ideal. But I still argue it's multi-tasking."
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"All I said to the Judge was ""As Counsel with complete Sertatude I....."""

2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,A good night's sleep helps you prepare for the day.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I plan to dream about my boss taking me out for a beer.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"I'm telling you, the Murphy people like to meet this way."
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"Power naps and standing desks are proven productivity enhancers... what's not to like?!"""
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It's just about maximizing efficiency. I've got to get my sleep in whenever I can.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,It's cool. I'm a psychosomatic workaholic.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,what do you mean halloween was last week?
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,"I take my work to bed with me, I may as well take my bed to work."
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,I think these early morning staff meetings are counterproductive.
2797,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,567,Why do you think I’d take this lying down!
