236,7,20,37,64,1.53125,0.0861682957845442,520,I understand you feel empty at your loss of sexual metaphor.

241,10,15,41,66,1.5303030303030303,0.09216306864088211,520,I think we can rule out a potassium deficiency.

263,5,25,37,67,1.5223880597014925,0.07772840303437369,520,So how long have you had this fear of monkeys?
263,7,21,39,67,1.5223880597014925,0.08334430218689941,520,Have you still been dreaming about the monkeys?

267,8,11,33,52,1.5192307692307692,0.10453655756148608,520,It's perfectly normal that you feel empty inside.

273,4,22,32,58,1.5172413793103448,0.08246570465502458,520,I'm afraid you have a split personality
274,8,15,37,60,1.5166666666666666,0.09355401674414741,520,I am afraid this discussion is just fruitless.
275,10,12,40,62,1.5161290322580645,0.09686229023804441,520,Do you identify as a banana or a plantain?
275,6,20,36,62,1.5161290322580645,0.0852468201815688,520,"What do you mean, exactly, by uncomfortable in your own skin?"
275,9,14,39,62,1.5161290322580645,0.0940929462839088,520,"As your doctor, I can honestly tell you you're not a couch-potato."
275,6,20,36,62,1.5161290322580645,0.0852468201815688,520,It's like a part of me is missing.
275,8,16,38,62,1.5161290322580645,0.09123958466923192,520,When did you first learn you weren't organic?
275,8,16,38,62,1.5161290322580645,0.09123958466923192,520,"I'm leaning towards banana split personality, but there a bunch of other possibilities"

275,11,10,41,62,1.5161290322580645,0.09955462821954468,520,You are not nuts. You're a fruit.
283,6,21,37,64,1.515625,0.08331007860054251,520,Why do you feel the need to compare yourself to apples and oranges?
283,3,27,34,64,1.515625,0.073840869160197,520,Why do you feel responsible for the downfall of so many people?
285,9,16,41,66,1.5151515151515151,0.08965727087216299,520,So was it a tough split?

289,6,13,30,49,1.510204081632653,0.10152933031700204,520,Let's talk more about your split personality.
289,9,7,33,49,1.510204081632653,0.11339852434129015,520,I've felt so empty since the split.
291,3,21,29,53,1.509433962264151,0.08356463959642835,520,"So, you gave everthing to this Daiquiri?"

292,6,16,33,55,1.509090909090909,0.09310479694386192,520,You seem to be searching for your inner self.
294,8,13,36,57,1.5087719298245614,0.09734188714756117,520,He slipped. It's not your fault.
294,8,13,36,57,1.5087719298245614,0.09734188714756117,520,"What I put on my breakfast cereal isn't relevant to your therapy session, Mr. Cavendish."
294,5,19,33,57,1.5087719298245614,0.08715356415734377,520,"So, you're tired of being stepped on?"
294,9,11,37,57,1.5087719298245614,0.10050875289987751,520,Talk to me about your nana issues.
294,8,13,36,57,1.5087719298245614,0.09734188714756117,520,Should I bill Dole or Chiquita for your therapy?
294,9,11,37,57,1.5087719298245614,0.10050875289987751,520,Why do YOU think everyone laughs when you get stepped on?
300,6,18,35,59,1.5084745762711864,0.08840717049104521,520,"I think that underneath that tough exterior, you’re actually rather sweet."
300,7,16,36,59,1.5084745762711864,0.09165304866820649,520,"I'm sorry, 'it's what's inside that counts' is just a saying"
300,8,14,37,59,1.5084745762711864,0.09478784134117897,520,"Seeing as I ate you for lunch, I'll comp this session."
300,7,16,36,59,1.5084745762711864,0.09165304866820649,520,Have you considered compost?
300,2,26,31,59,1.5084745762711864,0.07401360449577607,520,I think you may have a split personality.
300,4,22,33,59,1.5084745762711864,0.08152864970269623,520,You may be suffering from separation anxiety.
300,10,10,39,59,1.5084745762711864,0.10076528141184495,520,Things have been really tough since the split.
307,7,17,37,61,1.5081967213114753,0.0893906231548788,520,Why do you prefer to identify as a plantain?
307,6,19,36,61,1.5081967213114753,0.08627998273403781,520,I would say you have a 'split personality'.
307,7,17,37,61,1.5081967213114753,0.0893906231548788,520,How many monkeys did you say there were?
307,7,17,37,61,1.5081967213114753,0.0893906231548788,520,I am going to recommend more potassium.
307,11,9,41,61,1.5081967213114753,0.10087852029914164,520,I know exactly what it's like to be used by a big ape.
307,10,11,40,61,1.5081967213114753,0.09813270489654628,520,I just haven't been myself since that Sundae...
307,6,19,36,61,1.5081967213114753,0.08627998273403781,520,You have to come to terms with the loss of your inner self.
314,9,15,41,65,1.5076923076923077,0.09073173932373423,520,You're just spoiled.
315,6,16,34,56,1.5,0.09187795405622853,520,"On the phone, you said something was eating away at you..."
315,6,18,36,60,1.5,0.08733337646093729,520,"So when did you first start feeling like you're ""an accident waiting to happen""?"
315,8,13,37,58,1.5,0.09605024899878382,520,"Oh, no, no - ""low hanging fruit"" is just a metaphor."
315,6,10,28,44,1.5,0.11025628418806717,520,We don't want you slipping back into bad behavior
315,5,17,32,54,1.5,0.09061479586639896,520,You need to stop blaming yourself for the accident.
315,10,7,37,54,1.5,0.10819011658993088,520,I've been empty inside ever since the split.
315,7,13,34,54,1.5,0.09802379950319529,520,What's eating you?
315,7,16,37,60,1.5,0.09051016735969626,520,Quit blaming yourself for other people's slip-ups.
315,7,12,33,52,1.5,0.10090091909944687,520,You aren't responsible for other people's accidents.
315,8,11,35,54,1.5,0.10152574692465634,520,Lets try focusing on the chimp.
315,6,14,32,52,1.5,0.09709195467257717,520,Explain to me why you feel empty and used.
315,5,23,38,66,1.5,0.07859488645679295,520,When did you start feeling empty inside?
315,6,15,33,54,1.5,0.09439201899247568,520,"Yes, you have told me that your banana was really big"
315,10,8,38,56,1.5,0.10506646010483574,520,"I didn't mean to offend you, I use 'fruit' as an umbrella term."
315,4,20,32,56,1.5,0.08451542547285165,520,My initial diagnosis is separation anxiety.
315,5,17,32,54,1.5,0.09061479586639896,520,"What do you mean you ""gave him the slip""?"
315,6,17,35,58,1.5,0.08953060358121381,520,Separation anxiety is a perfectly normal reaction.
315,8,13,37,58,1.5,0.09605024899878382,520,Why do you feel that you're an accident waiting to happen?
315,4,21,33,58,1.5,0.08249731888070386,520,...it's normal to feel discarded after the relationship ends.
315,7,15,36,58,1.5,0.09284766908852593,520,"Ah, I see. And how did that make you peel?"
315,5,20,35,60,1.5,0.08403658068160179,520,"Everything's a ""slippery slope"" to you."
315,5,19,34,58,1.5,0.08608581939007433,520,Look: we all get stepped on. Deal with it.
315,8,10,34,52,1.5,0.10457123547173221,520,I witnessed my brother get peeled alive and turned into a smoothie when I was 3.
315,7,15,36,58,1.5,0.09284766908852593,520,"You'll fall for me someday. They all do, eventually."
315,5,23,38,66,1.5,0.07859488645679295,520,Hmmn...........sounds like you're playing the fall guy again

365,6,15,34,55,1.490909090909091,0.09310479694386192,520,And why do you describe yourself as an 'accident waiting to happen'?

405,4,18,32,54,1.4814814814814814,0.08663578203421357,520,I'm sorry. I was hungry.
405,7,12,35,54,1.4814814814814814,0.09799078929868854,520,Sleeping with you would be inappropriate. I ate you because I missed lunch. That's all.
405,8,10,36,54,1.4814814814814814,0.1014938757115261,520,Have you considered you might not be as funny as you used to be?

405,7,12,35,54,1.4814814814814814,0.09799078929868854,520,It's not your responsibility to make everyone laugh.

430,7,10,33,50,1.48,0.10396231656377287,520,Mhm. Classic signs of an Edible Complex.
430,6,12,32,50,1.48,0.09995917534020515,520,"It sounds like you yearn for someone to fall for you, and fall hard."
430,5,14,31,50,1.48,0.09578888350994406,520,You're low sense of self-esteem stems from the fact that you really are garbage.
430,6,12,32,50,1.48,0.09995917534020515,520,You're a fruit. Get used to it.
435,2,19,27,48,1.4791666666666667,0.08416034664846947,520,It appears you opened up too much.

440,4,13,27,44,1.4772727272727273,0.10015124061888322,520,Maybe slapstick isn't for you. Have you thought about standup?
441,4,11,25,40,1.475,0.10734260988738765,520,"So they fall for you, but they don't fall for you."

443,3,12,23,38,1.4736842105263157,0.10490693637264463,520,I guess it all started back in vaudeville.
445,8,10,37,55,1.4727272727272727,0.1000153033897904,520,I just feel like I've lost who I am inside.

449,6,13,34,53,1.471698113207547,0.09563694345158531,520,Perhaps there really is no 'inner you.'
454,5,14,32,51,1.4705882352941178,0.0943624267883605,520,Whoah...when I said you need to open up more I didn't mean like this!
454,3,18,30,51,1.4705882352941178,0.08564835163859433,520,There was a bunch of us when growing up but we've all been split.
454,6,12,33,51,1.4705882352941178,0.09843059135695006,520,"Let's not go there, it's a slippery slope."
454,5,14,32,51,1.4705882352941178,0.0943624267883605,520,And when did you first start having these thoughts - that you'll wind up on the street?
454,6,12,33,51,1.4705882352941178,0.09843059135695006,520,And how long have you self-identified as an avocado?
454,7,10,34,51,1.4705882352941178,0.10233716353490108,520,Such feelings of emptiness are not uncommon.
454,7,10,34,51,1.4705882352941178,0.10233716353490108,520,That's not what we mean by Freudian slip!
454,6,12,33,51,1.4705882352941178,0.09843059135695006,520,And it was after he stepped on you that you started to feel empty inside?
454,7,10,34,51,1.4705882352941178,0.10233716353490108,520,So let's get back to these feelings of responsibility for causing both pain and laughter.
454,6,12,33,51,1.4705882352941178,0.09843059135695006,520,You shouldn't feel guilty every time someone falls. Just the funny times.
454,8,8,35,51,1.4705882352941178,0.1060999941840681,520,Tell me about your first split.
454,6,12,33,51,1.4705882352941178,0.09843059135695006,520,Why is it so important that people know you're a plantain?
466,6,11,32,49,1.469387755102041,0.10144383191841319,520,Let me guess. You feel empty.
466,7,9,33,49,1.469387755102041,0.10555184115090407,520,I am afraid of making Freudians slip.
466,4,15,30,49,1.469387755102041,0.09268317410502525,520,Sorry -- I meant plantain.
466,3,17,29,49,1.469387755102041,0.08797630718624191,520,And yet people continue to walk all over you.
466,7,9,33,49,1.469387755102041,0.10555184115090407,520,And then she added sprinkles..
466,6,11,32,49,1.469387755102041,0.10144383191841319,520,Banana fanna fo........sorry.
466,6,11,32,49,1.469387755102041,0.10144383191841319,520,Close your eyes and imagine you're on a tropical island...
466,4,15,30,49,1.469387755102041,0.09268317410502525,520,"Don't worry, I see lots of patients with split personalities."
466,9,5,35,49,1.469387755102041,0.11332198128542639,520,Of course we're all stereotyped. Look how they drew my legs.
466,6,11,32,49,1.469387755102041,0.10144383191841319,520,"So, tell me more, about your ice cream sundae fantasy."
466,4,15,30,49,1.469387755102041,0.09268317410502525,520,How did that make you peel? Feel -- I mean feel. I promise that wasn't a Freudian slip...
466,6,11,32,49,1.469387755102041,0.10144383191841319,520,So you feel like an apple trapped in a banana's body?
478,5,12,30,47,1.4680851063829787,0.1001897544241429,520,"So, how did that make you peel...I mean feel?"
478,5,12,30,47,1.4680851063829787,0.1001897544241429,520,Maybe subconsciously I wanted him to slip and fall.
478,5,12,30,47,1.4680851063829787,0.1001897544241429,520,Let's talk about these so-called Freudian slips.
481,6,9,30,45,1.4666666666666666,0.10824588545146517,520,"So, she split on Sundae?"
482,3,14,26,43,1.4651162790697674,0.0961543909473311,520,Please tell me more about your family tree.
483,5,16,35,56,1.4642857142857142,0.08814202571752096,520,How long have you wanted to come out?
483,4,18,34,56,1.4642857142857142,0.08437811356173755,520,And how long have you felt like you've had a split personality?
485,5,9,27,41,1.4634146341463414,0.11096890893733974,520,Why do you feel that people are avoiding you?
486,6,13,35,54,1.462962962962963,0.09425482121793702,520,You can't keep blaming yourself for other people's slip-ups.
486,7,11,36,54,1.462962962962963,0.09789169189666713,520,All of my training points to 'Edible Complex.'
486,4,17,33,54,1.462962962962963,0.08652368047934506,520,"But when you let them walk all over you, they're the ones that get hurt."
489,8,8,36,52,1.4615384615384615,0.10443245473975118,520,I'm sorry I misdiagnosed you as nuts.
489,4,10,25,39,1.4615384615384615,0.10926174695215261,520,"I had no choice, you were going bad!"
489,6,12,34,52,1.4615384615384615,0.09694246735578528,520,So you think people are laughing at YOU when someone slips and falls?
489,4,16,32,52,1.4615384615384615,0.0888231183368655,520,Were you bruised as a child?
489,10,4,38,52,1.4615384615384615,0.11142007552013625,520,"I'm a plantain, dammit!"
489,4,16,32,52,1.4615384615384615,0.0888231183368655,520,Your fear of being 'tossed aside' is not an irrational one.
489,4,16,32,52,1.4615384615384615,0.0888231183368655,520,I know it's not easy but you're comparing apples and oranges.
489,5,8,26,39,1.4615384615384615,0.11527209988697773,520,So you've been feeling empty since the split.
497,6,17,40,63,1.4603174603174602,0.08413712756091785,520,And now you feel used?
498,6,11,33,50,1.46,0.09983660119803514,520,"No, I don't think your slips are Freudian."
498,4,15,31,50,1.46,0.09129454462097404,520,You know how it is...... one slip and you're no longer top banana.
498,5,13,32,50,1.46,0.09566096595876118,520,So when did you split?
498,7,9,34,50,1.46,0.10384446768792142,520,"Well, I'm flattered, but I think we need to keep our relationship purely slapstick."
498,8,7,35,50,1.46,0.10770329614269009,520,".......and when she split, did she also take the cherry?"
498,4,15,31,50,1.46,0.09129454462097404,520,Might it have been a Freudian slip?
498,4,15,31,50,1.46,0.09129454462097404,520,I feel like the whole world is falling down around me.
498,4,15,31,50,1.46,0.09129454462097404,520,"Don't give up, someone will fall for you."
498,5,13,32,50,1.46,0.09566096595876118,520,You seem to be suffering from separation anxiety.
498,4,15,31,50,1.46,0.09129454462097404,520,"No, Robert, I asked you to show me how you FEEL."
498,7,9,34,50,1.46,0.10384446768792142,520,You think you got problems. I just ate a client.

510,6,10,32,48,1.4583333333333333,0.10296290272744581,520,The last thing I remember was how cold the ice cream was.
510,6,10,32,48,1.4583333333333333,0.10296290272744581,520,You say your parents were eaten by chimpanzees?

521,6,9,31,46,1.4565217391304348,0.10635153512439034,520,Sure he slipped and fell. But what about MY pain?
521,5,11,30,46,1.4565217391304348,0.10170774527259566,520,Well . . the apple didn't fall far from the tree either
521,3,15,28,46,1.4565217391304348,0.09171749178143039,520,But not everyone can be top banana.

542,4,10,26,40,1.45,0.1071184343348939,520,When did this empty feeling start?
542,4,10,26,40,1.45,0.1071184343348939,520,Survivor's guilt is perfectly normal.
542,3,12,25,40,1.45,0.10095695960312838,520,I've been this way since the split.

567,5,10,30,45,1.4444444444444444,0.10325781969828725,520,We all get stepped on from time to time.
567,1,2,6,9,1.4444444444444444,0.2421610524189263,520,You've lost touch with your inner self.
567,4,12,29,45,1.4444444444444444,0.09824498113767943,520,I'm glad to see you finally open up.
567,5,10,30,45,1.4444444444444444,0.10325781969828725,520,It's what's inside of you that matters.
567,7,6,32,45,1.4444444444444444,0.11261607056297968,520,You feel rejected because of the color of your skin?
567,3,6,18,27,1.4444444444444444,0.1343267832948864,520,"So you have feelings of emptiness, like something is eating at you from the inside..."
567,5,10,30,45,1.4444444444444444,0.10325781969828725,520,"In retrospect, we should have discussed the 800 pound gorilla"
577,5,13,34,52,1.4423076923076923,0.09277627421740595,520,An orange referred you to me?
577,5,13,34,52,1.4423076923076923,0.09277627421740595,520,You need to stop seeing other people's missteps as your own.
579,7,5,31,43,1.441860465116279,0.11672119710297268,520,"Uh huh..., and how that make you peel?"
579,5,9,29,43,1.441860465116279,0.1068129132128192,520,It's natural to feel discarded from time to time...
579,6,7,30,43,1.441860465116279,0.11187679894008463,520,"No, Mr. Denham, I will not call you 'Kong,' and please come down from the bookcase."
579,3,13,27,43,1.441860465116279,0.09588617733994562,520,"I mean, I just feel like the fall guy all the time."
579,5,9,29,43,1.441860465116279,0.1068129132128192,520,Let's talk about your feeling bruised and discarded.
584,5,12,33,50,1.44,0.09544738907708608,520,It's good to see you opening up.
584,6,10,34,50,1.44,0.09963197585235824,520,"Tell me about your ""foster"" parents."
584,2,18,30,50,1.44,0.08161632489763256,520,Tell me more about your bruised childhood.
584,8,6,36,50,1.44,0.10751364412701016,520,"So you split on a sundae, right?"
584,4,14,32,50,1.44,0.09107072828862414,520,How are you doing post-split?
584,6,10,34,50,1.44,0.09963197585235824,520,"""Feelings of emptiness are common for someone in your position""."
590,6,6,29,41,1.4390243902439024,0.11607808813942237,520,"...and then, I was skinned alive..."
590,2,14,25,41,1.4390243902439024,0.09271501370121078,520,...and what is your earliest memory of being stepped on?
590,4,10,27,41,1.4390243902439024,0.10504807545052695,520,I feel so empty on the inside
590,4,10,27,41,1.4390243902439024,0.10504807545052695,520,In psychoanalysis we take slips seriously.
590,4,10,27,41,1.4390243902439024,0.10504807545052695,520,"So what is worse, when people step on you, or avoid you all together?"
595,4,13,31,48,1.4375,0.09371305418575736,520,"If you were a fruit, what fruit would you be?"
595,5,11,32,48,1.4375,0.09832935140393091,520,So he left you for a sundae?
595,6,9,33,48,1.4375,0.10273843570063136,520,"So he ran off with a little Chiquita, eh?"
595,5,11,32,48,1.4375,0.09832935140393091,520,And sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel.
595,4,13,31,48,1.4375,0.09371305418575736,520,I’m not falling for that one again.
595,6,9,33,48,1.4375,0.10273843570063136,520,"It's not a homophobic slur, you are a fruit."
595,5,11,32,48,1.4375,0.09832935140393091,520,I believe you have a split personality.
595,6,9,33,48,1.4375,0.10273843570063136,520,I've spent all my life being stepped on.
595,4,13,31,48,1.4375,0.09371305418575736,520,"Sorry about my little Freudian split -I mean, slip, sorry!"
595,3,8,21,32,1.4375,0.11826620464566504,520,Am I hearing you say that your life no longer bears fruit?
595,6,9,33,48,1.4375,0.10273843570063136,520,When did your father split from the bunch and how did that make you peel?
595,6,9,33,48,1.4375,0.10273843570063136,520,"Tell me about your nana, Nana Beau Bana."
595,4,13,31,48,1.4375,0.09371305418575736,520,"What exactly do you mean by ""empty inside""?"
595,5,11,32,48,1.4375,0.09832935140393091,520,So you've been having a hard time since the split?
595,3,15,30,48,1.4375,0.0888572546398304,520,But our attempts to probe your innermost self have been fruitless.
595,4,13,31,48,1.4375,0.09371305418575736,520,Sometimes I feel like you're not all here.
595,6,9,33,48,1.4375,0.10273843570063136,520,I think we're done here.
595,5,11,32,48,1.4375,0.09832935140393091,520,Sometimes splits can be messy.
613,7,10,38,55,1.4363636363636363,0.09627274793894025,520,"I know, but eventually we're all compost."
614,4,9,26,39,1.435897435897436,0.10894458591456893,520,Remember what Freud said: There are no accidents.
615,3,14,29,46,1.434782608695652,0.0914307843222464,520,"So, what makes you think I would fall for you?"
615,5,10,31,46,1.434782608695652,0.10144927536231883,520,Is it possible you might be a Freudian slip?
615,3,14,29,46,1.434782608695652,0.0914307843222464,520,I'm tired of being blamed for other people's slip-ups.
615,2,16,28,46,1.434782608695652,0.08598490999531203,520,When did you first notice you'd lost touch with your inner self?
615,3,14,29,46,1.434782608695652,0.0914307843222464,520,I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who think you're still funny.
615,5,10,31,46,1.434782608695652,0.10144927536231883,520,I'm not so sure that bananopause is a real thing.
615,5,10,31,46,1.434782608695652,0.10144927536231883,520,"So... what I'm hearing is, it's one Freudian slip after another."
615,5,10,31,46,1.434782608695652,0.10144927536231883,520,I'm just tired of people stepping all over me!
615,3,14,29,46,1.434782608695652,0.0914307843222464,520,Stop calling me Chiquita!
615,6,8,32,46,1.434782608695652,0.10610437807375725,520,You need to stop blaming yourself for others' slip-ups.
615,4,12,30,46,1.434782608695652,0.09657003622584162,520,Had you considered that perhaps they are laughing with you?
615,3,14,29,46,1.434782608695652,0.0914307843222464,520,It's like he only cared about what was on the inside...
615,5,10,31,46,1.434782608695652,0.10144927536231883,520,So people step on you?
615,5,10,31,46,1.434782608695652,0.10144927536231883,520,Tell me more about why you think life is fruitless.
615,6,8,32,46,1.434782608695652,0.10610437807375725,520,Do you want to slip on something more comfortable?
615,4,12,30,46,1.434782608695652,0.09657003622584162,520,What did the monkey do next?
631,4,15,34,53,1.4339622641509433,0.08733032049795691,520,This business of you just lying on the floor is very passive aggressive.
631,7,9,37,53,1.4339622641509433,0.0990133985533268,520,You can be open here.
633,4,11,29,44,1.4318181818181819,0.09967031951757234,520,"Really, you must let go of the guilt. You're the one who keeps getting stepped on!"
633,2,15,27,44,1.4318181818181819,0.08843080734603967,520,I wonder if you unconsciously want people to slip and fall.
633,4,11,29,44,1.4318181818181819,0.09967031951757234,520,You feel like everyone steps all over you?
633,3,13,28,44,1.4318181818181819,0.0942183110669241,520,"Causing harm to others may be morally indefensible, but when I picture it, it still makes me laugh."
633,5,9,30,44,1.4318181818181819,0.10483918659149474,520,I feel used and discarded.
633,6,7,31,44,1.4318181818181819,0.1097649192483534,520,Well maybe you should try Standup>
633,5,9,30,44,1.4318181818181819,0.10483918659149474,520,We need to peel back a bit more.
633,5,9,30,44,1.4318181818181819,0.10483918659149474,520,When did you shed your inner self?
633,5,9,30,44,1.4318181818181819,0.10483918659149474,520,Any issues other than experiencing an empty feeling?
633,5,9,30,44,1.4318181818181819,0.10483918659149474,520,Tell me about the first time you made a Freudian slip.
633,6,7,31,44,1.4318181818181819,0.1097649192483534,520,How do you really peel?
644,4,14,33,51,1.4313725490196079,0.08968311079238646,520,"My, aren't we thin skinned!"
644,4,14,33,51,1.4313725490196079,0.08968311079238646,520,"Just relax, Mr. Peel, and tell me what’s eating you."
644,4,14,33,51,1.4313725490196079,0.08968311079238646,520,We don't see nuts until the second year of residency.
644,6,10,35,51,1.4313725490196079,0.09803921568627452,520,"I couldn't help it,doc, she was getting under my skin."
644,7,8,36,51,1.4313725490196079,0.1019607843137255,520,I suppose that was a breach of the physician-patient relationship.
644,6,10,35,51,1.4313725490196079,0.09803921568627452,520,Your life isn't a joke.
650,2,14,26,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09108238758047692,520,So she dumped you for the top banana?
650,5,8,29,42,1.4285714285714286,0.10853719125189994,520,"Now that I've opened up, I feel vulnerable."
650,6,6,30,42,1.4285714285714286,0.11376186562588508,520,"Ok, let's begin. Tell me how you peel."
650,4,10,28,42,1.4285714285714286,0.10304795824770656,520,It appears you have a split personality.
650,1,16,25,42,1.4285714285714286,0.0844663314080219,520,I feel like my life has become one big joke.
650,2,14,26,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09108238758047692,520,I'm not sure I really understand what's eating at you.
650,5,11,33,49,1.4285714285714286,0.09671474291233285,520,"'Now tell me, what happened after the chimp first spotted you'"
650,3,12,27,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09724937795785968,520,I'm going to have to ask you to zip yourself up.
650,2,14,26,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09108238758047692,520,It's not only what's inside that matters.
650,6,6,30,42,1.4285714285714286,0.11376186562588508,520,Was it more than a Freudian Slip?
650,3,15,31,49,1.4285714285714286,0.08748177652797065,520,Why do you think he fell for you?
650,4,10,28,42,1.4285714285714286,0.10304795824770656,520,Tell me about your loss of inner self.
650,3,12,27,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09724937795785968,520,"So, you feel like you are always blamed when someone slips up."
650,5,8,29,42,1.4285714285714286,0.10853719125189994,520,the problem is your appeal
650,3,9,23,35,1.4285714285714286,0.11065666703449761,520,Would you like to discuss the split?
650,2,8,18,28,1.4285714285714286,0.11983864182969442,520,You ARE empty inside.
650,2,14,26,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09108238758047692,520,Tell me about the day you got your peelings hurt.
650,1,16,25,42,1.4285714285714286,0.0844663314080219,520,So tell me exactly why the term 'second banana' is such a problem for you.
650,3,12,27,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09724937795785968,520,"Yes, but you can't let ""slippery"" define who you are."
650,4,13,32,49,1.4285714285714286,0.09221388919541469,520,"Well, it's not REALLY all about who you are on the inside."
650,6,6,30,42,1.4285714285714286,0.11376186562588508,520,You can't just hurt everyone that walks all over you.
650,3,12,27,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09724937795785968,520,It's obvious to me that you can no longer afford to ignore the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room!
650,1,16,25,42,1.4285714285714286,0.0844663314080219,520,"So, tell me about the emptiness you say you're feeling."
650,5,8,29,42,1.4285714285714286,0.10853719125189994,520,And how does it make you feel when people cautiously step around?
650,6,6,30,42,1.4285714285714286,0.11376186562588508,520,"So you hurt people, but you don't mean to?"
650,3,12,27,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09724937795785968,520,"You say you're always ""the fall guy."" How does that make you feel?"
650,2,14,26,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09108238758047692,520,"Slippery is one thing, but now you're being evasive."
650,7,7,35,49,1.4285714285714286,0.10514001031342675,520,so he left you feeling empty
650,4,10,28,42,1.4285714285714286,0.10304795824770656,520,Which is the bigger issue: feeling dangerous or empty?
650,3,12,27,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09724937795785968,520,I hear you saying you feel empty inside.
650,5,11,33,49,1.4285714285714286,0.09671474291233285,520,Do you understand your life is a joke
650,5,11,33,49,1.4285714285714286,0.09671474291233285,520,And you said the split left you feeling empty inside?
650,3,12,27,42,1.4285714285714286,0.09724937795785968,520,It sounds like the issues started after your split.

803,2,15,29,46,1.4130434782608696,0.08555636025011852,520,So you feel you were labeled?

840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,"So, you feel your career has been limited to slapstick comedy?"

840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,I think we're getting into slippery territory here...
840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,I don't think the fear of being composted has a name.
840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,"So, you say you feel used and discarded?"
840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,What makes you think people are always falling for you?
840,2,13,27,42,1.4047619047619047,0.0905495148811283,520,"To be honest, a part of me wants them to slip..."
840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,"You have to stop letting people walk all over you, Nana."

840,4,9,29,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10257726364486693,520,I can't help but feel I'm going to be the cause of someone's downfall.
840,2,13,27,42,1.4047619047619047,0.0905495148811283,520,"Yes, those brown spots are a sign of aging, but you were still good on the inside."
840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,50% of all bananas split.
840,5,7,30,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10809040291672044,520,You seem to me to have somewhat of a split personality.
840,4,9,29,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10257726364486693,520,"On the bright side, someone really enjoyed that banana daiquiri."
840,4,9,29,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10257726364486693,520,"My specialties are orange rinds and cherry pits, but I've had success with clients similar to you."
840,2,13,27,42,1.4047619047619047,0.0905495148811283,520,You have plenty of skin in the game. You just need the guts to see it through.
840,4,9,29,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10257726364486693,520,You say your wife split and your life is slipping away?
840,3,11,28,42,1.4047619047619047,0.09675047716181098,520,I certainly understand why people keep falling for you.
840,5,7,30,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10809040291672044,520,Can you describe your peelings?
840,5,7,30,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10809040291672044,520,It's natural to feel empty inside.
840,4,9,29,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10257726364486693,520,So you feel used and discarded?
840,6,5,31,42,1.4047619047619047,0.11333567570950197,520,Why do you think you feel empty inside?
840,4,9,29,42,1.4047619047619047,0.10257726364486693,520,I'm tired of being blamed for everybody's slip ups!
869,4,11,32,47,1.4042553191489362,0.09452923656848809,520,She slipped. She fell. Get over it.
869,3,13,31,47,1.4042553191489362,0.08950255407538756,520,When did you get dumped by Apple?
869,5,9,33,47,1.4042553191489362,0.09930179226189577,520,Why do you feel you're life's one big joke?
872,3,17,37,57,1.4035087719298245,0.078598505165748,520,Don't blame yourself; it was probably what we like to call a Freudian slip.
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,I think we've peeled backed more than you can handle today.
873,3,8,24,35,1.4,0.11000381964338538,520,And was it then that you went bananas?
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,"Well, you're right. Sometimes a banana is just a banana, but....."
873,4,6,25,35,1.4,0.11739468729479209,520,"After what happened at brunch on Sunday, I don't feel that it would be ethical for me to continue as your therapist."
873,5,8,32,45,1.4,0.10249414863810764,520,You're experiencing survivor's guilt.
873,5,8,32,45,1.4,0.10249414863810764,520,So she'll never dance again ... how do you feel about that?
873,3,10,27,40,1.4,0.09999999999999998,520,"How does that make you peel—sorry, feel...feel?"
873,2,12,26,40,1.4,0.09336995618478523,520,You're bipeeler.
873,3,16,36,55,1.4,0.08040302522073697,520,You've got to rid yourself of the illusion that everyone is always falling for you.
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,So you feel you've lost your manhood?
873,3,10,27,40,1.4,0.09999999999999998,520,"No, it's perfectly natural to feel there's something missing in your life."
873,3,8,24,35,1.4,0.11000381964338538,520,I'm afraid my lunch hour is almost up.
873,2,12,26,40,1.4,0.09336995618478523,520,I think I know why you feel impotent.
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,"As a Freudian, I’m intrigued, but as a feminist, you disgust me."
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,So when did you first stop seeing yourself as appealing?
873,2,10,23,35,1.4,0.10207922446427037,520,I feel my life is just slipping away.
873,3,8,24,35,1.4,0.11000381964338538,520,Being second is also valuable.
873,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,520,And how did it feel when the monkey tossed you aside.
873,5,8,32,45,1.4,0.10249414863810764,520,Being part of a bunch lost its appeal?
873,2,12,26,40,1.4,0.09336995618478523,520,And when did you leave the bunch?
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,What did you do with the chimp?
873,2,12,26,40,1.4,0.09336995618478523,520,So you suspect monkey business?
873,3,10,27,40,1.4,0.09999999999999998,520,So why is it so important to be the top banana?
873,2,12,26,40,1.4,0.09336995618478523,520,"When I said I found you appealing, it was just a Freudian slip."
873,2,12,26,40,1.4,0.09336995618478523,520,So you think you finally got that monkey off your back?
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,"He told me I'd lost my appeal, and then he split."
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,I feel like I've served my purpose in life
873,3,2,15,20,1.4,0.16858544608470488,520,I'm willing to make an exception and charge you on a sliding scale
873,5,6,29,40,1.4,0.11208970766356098,520,Do you have composting thoughts?
873,3,10,27,40,1.4,0.09999999999999998,520,"I do apologize, sir. I missed breakfast."
873,5,6,29,40,1.4,0.11208970766356098,520,Why do you let people to step all over you for laughs?
873,3,12,30,45,1.4,0.09211323729436766,520,Let's talk about why you feel objectified by women.
873,4,10,31,45,1.4,0.09744203145947591,520,"Well, your appealing nature is even hard for me to resist, after all, you are easy to fall for."
873,4,8,28,40,1.4,0.10621700090875885,520,Tell me about your peelings.
873,2,12,26,40,1.4,0.09336995618478523,520,Lately I just feel all empty inside.
873,3,10,27,40,1.4,0.09999999999999998,520,Ok.. You had a slip. So now we make a fresh start.
873,3,10,27,40,1.4,0.09999999999999998,520,"People think you're slippery, how does that make you feel?"
910,4,17,42,63,1.3968253968253967,0.07686804028227165,520,Don't beat yourself up. Not everyone can do comedy.
910,7,11,45,63,1.3968253968253967,0.08628321926729898,520,When did you first realize you were only skin deep?
912,3,13,32,48,1.3958333333333333,0.08802191525416737,520,Sorry--am I getting under your skin?

1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,I just don't get the appeal in hanging with the rest of the bunch.
1176,1,12,25,38,1.368421052631579,0.08781407871437069,520,"You're right, it is a slippery slope."
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,"In my diagnosis, I'd say you have 'split personality disorder.'"
1176,0,7,12,19,1.368421052631579,0.11369720523522558,520,How long have you felt this emptiness?
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,"So, you feel like you're not all there? Empty inside?"
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,You were saying you feel all eaten up inside. . .
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,"I know you don't like to talk about your ex, but we need to discuss the split"
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,But what's really missing on the inside?
1176,5,4,29,38,1.368421052631579,0.11576360761135697,520,My life is a joke.
1176,5,4,29,38,1.368421052631579,0.11576360761135697,520,"Okay, I'll write you a prescription for Viagra."
1176,5,4,29,38,1.368421052631579,0.11576360761135697,520,Why sidewalks?
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,So what do think’s causing all these slip-ups?
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,Of course you feel stepped on.
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,Let's focus on being less under foot and more in hand.
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,"So, did the Viagra help at all?"
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,"Try to remember: they're not laughing at you, they're laughing with you."
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,"What do you mean, you've been looking at my slip?"
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,Why do you feel people don't take you seriously?
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,It seems like every guy I meet ends up falling for me...
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,I'm thinking split personality.
1176,1,12,25,38,1.368421052631579,0.08781407871437069,520,I can assure you that I will not fall for you!!!
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,Did you just call me Chiquita?
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,How long have you had this feeling of emptiness?
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,"So you told him to stop monkey-ing around, and then what happened?"
1176,1,12,25,38,1.368421052631579,0.08781407871437069,520,...And you feel that something is missing?
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,How long have you believed that deep down inside you were actually a starfish?
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,She tossed me for a plantain. And they say size doesn't matter!
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,I'm sick of being the fall guy.
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,Don't let him treat you like garbage.
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,And what makes you think people avoid you?
1176,2,10,26,38,1.368421052631579,0.09557085082356087,520,You say you're feeling empty inside?
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,Your insecurity is certainly not due lack of appeal.
1176,3,8,27,38,1.368421052631579,0.10274367442244295,520,And just why do you not feel part of the bunch anymore?
1176,4,6,28,38,1.368421052631579,0.10944741998106026,520,Can you tell me why you split up?
1227,3,19,46,68,1.3676470588235294,0.06918696204926,520,Not your fault. He should have looked where he was walking.
1228,5,8,36,49,1.3673469387755102,0.0953594950263686,520,Worthless piece of trash or compost?
1229,2,7,21,30,1.3666666666666667,0.11227361214762056,520,"Technically speaking, it's dissociative personality disorder. But in your case, we'll just go with split personality."
1229,2,7,21,30,1.3666666666666667,0.11227361214762056,520,So how long have you had these feelings of being totally discarded?
1231,4,7,30,41,1.3658536585365855,0.10333522031373103,520,But I find you very appealing...

1231,5,5,31,41,1.3658536585365855,0.10907648670730682,520,"Who knew ""going bananas"" was a real thing?"
1231,3,9,29,41,1.3658536585365855,0.0972556196945214,520,What makes you think you have a split personality?
1231,4,7,30,41,1.3658536585365855,0.10333522031373103,520,"Well, you may think it was a slip, but I think it was a relapse."
1231,3,9,29,41,1.3658536585365855,0.0972556196945214,520,Do you find yourself appealing.
1231,1,13,27,41,1.3658536585365855,0.08378323920642766,520,And why do you think that was a Freudian slip?
1231,5,5,31,41,1.3658536585365855,0.10907648670730682,520,Your case is appealing to me.
1231,2,11,28,41,1.3658536585365855,0.09076972715087023,520,I dunno...I just feel empty all the time.
1231,3,9,29,41,1.3658536585365855,0.0972556196945214,520,It's no longer called a split personality.
1231,3,9,29,41,1.3658536585365855,0.0972556196945214,520,And then they called me 'yella'.
1231,3,9,29,41,1.3658536585365855,0.0972556196945214,520,Your wife's reason for the divorce is that you were an accident waiting to happen?
1231,4,7,30,41,1.3658536585365855,0.10333522031373103,520,I seem to have lost my purpose in life.

1244,5,6,33,44,1.3636363636363635,0.10328079651648403,520,"When you hear someone say ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away,"" how does that make you feel?"
1244,2,8,23,33,1.3636363636363635,0.10497277621629558,520,When did you first start feeling empty inside?

1244,7,2,35,44,1.3636363636363635,0.1130534733386903,520,"""Ate"" is such a strong word."
1244,1,10,22,33,1.3636363636363635,0.09552666827968552,520,I'm tempted to ask how that makes you peel.
1244,1,2,8,11,1.3636363636363635,0.20327890704543547,520,Do you think that was a freudian slip?
1244,2,8,23,33,1.3636363636363635,0.10497277621629558,520,You caused a Freudian slip.
1244,4,8,32,44,1.3636363636363635,0.09802979382130766,520,"I loved my mother and father, but I did feel hostility toward the rest of the bunch."
1244,3,10,31,44,1.3636363636363635,0.09248112252896155,520,So......how long have you had this feeling that you are always being stepped on.....?
1244,0,12,21,33,1.3636363636363635,0.08503766788122592,520,Have you ever tried going for a laugh that wasn't at somebody else's expense?
1244,1,10,22,33,1.3636363636363635,0.09552666827968552,520,"After you gave him the slip, what happened next?"
1244,5,10,40,55,1.3636363636363635,0.08747731351357967,520,Have you looked for jobs in sex education?
1244,4,4,25,33,1.3636363636363635,0.12168468488037128,520,Sometimes the emotional bruises can hurt worse.
1244,2,12,30,44,1.3636363636363635,0.08657756968052124,520,I've really slipped up this time.
1244,2,8,23,33,1.3636363636363635,0.10497277621629558,520,"Yes, I agree that it was a slip, but are you sure it was Freudian?"
1244,3,6,24,33,1.3636363636363635,0.11363636363636362,520,Being rejected by Chiquita is no reason to feel you've lost your a peel.

1244,4,4,25,33,1.3636363636363635,0.12168468488037128,520,I see this could lead to a Freudian Slip
1244,3,6,24,33,1.3636363636363635,0.11363636363636362,520,I tend to trip people up. I guess that's why they don't like me.
1244,4,4,25,33,1.3636363636363635,0.12168468488037128,520,I’m sorry but even without that part it's unethical for me to date a patient.
1244,2,8,23,33,1.3636363636363635,0.10497277621629558,520,"Well, we can all agree that you aren't completely bananas."
1244,2,8,23,33,1.3636363636363635,0.10497277621629558,520,"I identify myself as a peach, so I should be allowed to use the peach bathroom."
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,"Perhaps the term 'fruit' was descriptive, not derogatory."
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,I hear you saying you feel like an accident waiting to happen.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,It's natural to feel you've lost the best part of yourself in a split.
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,What do you do for fun?
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"You may be irrational, but you're not bananas."
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,"No, I don't want to slip into something a little more comfortable!"
1269,5,3,28,36,1.3611111111111112,0.12053306058872547,520,"Well, that was highly unethical, but I needed that. I do often get hangry during these sessions."
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,What's your secret for mastering the splits? It's very appealing.
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,"No, I believe you. You don't need to show it to me."
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,What did he think was going to happen if he kept stepping all over you?
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,I get it now. It wasn't the split. You feel that you've been stepped on all your life.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,Next time can you bring your other half?
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,You made who slip?
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,So you've lost touch with your inner self-tell me about that.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"Even though you have no substance, you can still have appeal."
1269,5,3,28,36,1.3611111111111112,0.12053306058872547,520,I wasn't ready.
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,You seem to be suffering from a split personality disorder.
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,I'm afraid I'm not as appealing as I once was.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,My fear of death intensified with the appearance of brown spots.
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,So you just let people step all over you?
1269,3,20,49,72,1.3611111111111112,0.06650671996932396,520,"If the clown has forgiven you, don't you think it's time to let it go?"
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"Yeah, I was hanging in there for a while. Now... Not so much."
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,A hazard to anyone who encounters you? Don't you think that's a little theatrical?
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,So I said let's split and she laughed.
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,"What constitutes ""appeal"" can be very slippery, as you know."
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,They're not laughing at you. They're laughing at him.
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,It is my fault she slipped out of my life.

1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,"It's too soon to say if it's split personality disorder, but the diagnosis is appealing."
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,You pay on a sliding scale.
1269,0,13,23,36,1.3611111111111112,0.08118935126220327,520,Whether I find you appealing is beside the point
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,Tell me what led to the split.
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,"Well, is it possible that he never would have been comfortable in his own skin?"
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,"How do you feel about vanilla ice cream, crushed nuts and whipped cream?"
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,Let's find the inner you.
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,What do you think she meant by Second Banana?

1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,Why do you feel like the world is waiting for you to slip up?
1269,0,13,23,36,1.3611111111111112,0.08118935126220327,520,"Based on what you told me about your mother, I'm afraid you've got what we call an edible complex."
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,It's not your fault that they don't watch where they're walking.
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,And how does the split make you peel?
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,"No, I don't think all those slips were Freudian."

1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,Lately it seems like everyone is avoiding me.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"Please, tell me how you peel."

1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,"So, why don't you tell me about the split?"
1269,5,3,28,36,1.3611111111111112,0.12053306058872547,520,So you were born a banana but identify as a kumquat?
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,You'll be fine -- I deal with splits all the time.

1269,5,3,28,36,1.3611111111111112,0.12053306058872547,520,"So the melody didn't bother you as much as the lyrics to 'Yes, we have no bananas?'"
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,"So, when did you first notice you felt so empty inside?"

1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,How long have you felt all eaten up inside?
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,You feel empty inside?
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,Sometimes it feels like my life is just an endless series of slip-ups
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"Actually, you ARE the butt of a lot of jokes."
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,Sorry I laughed. Go on...
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,Lately i've just felt empty inside...
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,Perhaps your low potassium is causing your depression.
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,"Splits happen, bru."

1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,"I, too, fear the vegans."
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,"Sure people blame you too much for their falls, but I am sensing some real guilt here, too."
1269,0,13,23,36,1.3611111111111112,0.08118935126220327,520,So you say you're not peeling very well.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,I used to be the top banana.....
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,"So, since when have you had this hollow feeling."
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,I'm going to recommend a Jungian colleague of mine.
1269,0,13,23,36,1.3611111111111112,0.08118935126220327,520,It's evident to me that your problems are more than skin deep.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,I think you may be unclear about the meaning of a 'Freudian slip'
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"Maybe people are laughing with you, not at you?"
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,I would say you're ripe for analysis.
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,She took all of me. I feel so empty inside.
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,You're not the first banana I've had that feels on the inside they're really a plantain.
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,There's usually more to talk about once we've peeled back all these layers.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,When did you first start believing you were actually a plantain?
1269,5,3,28,36,1.3611111111111112,0.12053306058872547,520,Sometimes I think I'd be better off bread.
1269,2,9,25,36,1.3611111111111112,0.0988246625745851,520,I thought it was a minor slip-up.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"So, you and Cherry decided to make the split?"
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,Take your time. I'm comfortable with silence.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,What matters is whether you believe our sessions have become fruitless.
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,Just because it's cliche doesn't mean it isn't painful.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,People step all over me and then pretend like they're the victim.
1269,3,7,26,36,1.3611111111111112,0.10655334588966311,520,"So, what would make you think that you have a split personality?"
1269,4,5,27,36,1.3611111111111112,0.11375815182914926,520,Sometimes I just feel like such a joke.
1269,1,11,24,36,1.3611111111111112,0.09043789220055394,520,You are not alone: A split personality can drive anyone bananas.

1358,4,6,29,39,1.358974358974359,0.10702188336252005,520,I said you might have Multiple Personality Disorder. I never said you were bananas.
1358,3,8,28,39,1.358974358974359,0.10051943022691538,520,"When your mom split, how did that make you peel?"
1358,2,10,27,39,1.358974358974359,0.09356617010344374,520,What I hear you saying is that you feel unappealing!
1358,3,8,28,39,1.358974358974359,0.10051943022691538,520,How long has The Name Game been your favorite song?
1358,1,12,26,39,1.358974358974359,0.08605289374860925,520,"So how did you FEEL when he took what he wanted, then just discarded you?"
1358,3,8,28,39,1.358974358974359,0.10051943022691538,520,I wouldn't take it personally. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
1358,4,6,29,39,1.358974358974359,0.10702188336252005,520,"Emotionally, you are just an accident waiting to happen."
1358,3,8,28,39,1.358974358974359,0.10051943022691538,520,"No. A ""Freudian slip"" is a different thing."
1358,3,8,28,39,1.358974358974359,0.10051943022691538,520,"Well, do you think that you're a tired, old joke?"
1358,3,8,28,39,1.358974358974359,0.10051943022691538,520,"Your insides have been sliced up, slathered in buttery sauce and ignited over a bed of vanilla ice cream? I'm afraid we'll need another session to unpack that metaphor, Mr. Foster."

1358,4,6,29,39,1.358974358974359,0.10702188336252005,520,Maybe daylight has come and you can't go home anymore.'
1358,3,8,28,39,1.358974358974359,0.10051943022691538,520,Why do you think people walk all over you?

1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,Maybe it was just a freudian slip?
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,This is a breakthrough. You finally opened up.
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,He did that and then cast you aside?
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,"Really, your the victim?"

1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,People slip on all kinds of things - don't feel so guilty.
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,When did start feeling like garbage?
1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,"You can split, but you paid for the full hour."
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,nd how long have you felt like an accident waiting to happen?
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,Have you always been thin-skinned?
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,I'm glad you're being so open with me.
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,"You have to stop blaming yourself, he's the one who slipped!"
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,I've been feeling quite empty lately.
1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,You need to stop dating all these low hanging fruit.
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,I see you're peeling better
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,Do women actually fall for that?
1391,5,2,27,34,1.3529411764705883,0.12582953229028945,520,A Freudian slipped?
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,I feel like there's a part of me missing
1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,"so, he only wanted you for your potassium?"
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,Sounds like separation anxiety.
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,We all slip up sometimes. Forgive yourself and move on.
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,What's the difference that you ended up in a banana cream pie rather than a banana split? They're both to die for.
1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,"""It's not your fault people keep falling for you""."
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,She was only interested in my body.
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,You're unpeeling me with your eyes.
1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,Tell me about the split.
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,"Yes, I do understand emptiness."
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,"...and, yes, sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel."
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,"I get it, you're not the top banana anymore."
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,Explain to me again why you feel your life is so fruitless.
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,"Well, you are slippery."
1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,I WOULD NOT REFER TO THIS SESSION AS FRUITLESS
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,I really think we are making progress in peeling back your emotional layers.
1391,1,10,23,34,1.3529411764705883,0.09328958365867754,520,You blame yourself for everyone else's slip ups.
1391,2,8,24,34,1.3529411764705883,0.1023986211504105,520,I'm tired of being the fall guy.
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,"And when someone slipped on you, how did that make you feel?"
1391,3,6,25,34,1.3529411764705883,0.11076104372838493,520,And when did you feel you were slipping?
1431,3,7,27,37,1.3513513513513513,0.10409207214676887,520,So how long have you had this fear of being stepped on?
1431,1,11,25,37,1.3513513513513513,0.08849947164138966,520,Have you ever heard of a Freudian slip-and-fall?
1431,1,11,25,37,1.3513513513513513,0.08849947164138966,520,It seems a bit late to be worrying about size.
1431,2,9,26,37,1.3513513513513513,0.09661085851138386,520,Your lack of an inner-self appears to be the crux of the problem.
1431,1,11,25,37,1.3513513513513513,0.08849947164138966,520,Tell me about life after the split.
1431,6,1,30,37,1.3513513513513513,0.12385339716096866,520,If you were the Invisible _Gentleman_ you'd use a fig leaf.
1431,3,7,27,37,1.3513513513513513,0.10409207214676887,520,Talk to me about your Freudian slip.
1431,5,3,29,37,1.3513513513513513,0.1176357194342396,520,"Now, perhaps, we can get in touch with your feminine side."
1431,3,7,27,37,1.3513513513513513,0.10409207214676887,520,"You understand that the falls, the slapstick...that's not you."
1431,4,5,28,37,1.3513513513513513,0.1110705225760176,520,When did you first notice people avoiding you?

1431,3,7,27,37,1.3513513513513513,0.10409207214676887,520,"Technically, what you experienced is not a Freudian slip."
1431,1,11,25,37,1.3513513513513513,0.08849947164138966,520,Let's talk about what's getting under your skin.
1431,1,11,25,37,1.3513513513513513,0.08849947164138966,520,I do think we've made progress since the split.
1431,4,5,28,37,1.3513513513513513,0.1110705225760176,520,She decided I no longer appealed to her so last Sunday she split and hooked up with a fast-talking plantain -- a real smoothie.
1431,4,5,28,37,1.3513513513513513,0.1110705225760176,520,"So, when did you first have this feeling that people were avoiding you?"
1431,4,5,28,37,1.3513513513513513,0.1110705225760176,520,Let's peel that back
1431,4,5,28,37,1.3513513513513513,0.1110705225760176,520,I guess I just don't understand why I always have to be the fall guy.
1449,4,13,43,60,1.35,0.07820370329491788,520,"Doctor, I haven't been feeling comfortable in my own skin lately."
1449,2,10,28,40,1.35,0.09163752450517142,520,I think you lost your identity with all that knock knock stuff
1449,4,6,30,40,1.35,0.1046973660678169,520,"Look, I admit you have appeal, but sometimes a banana is just a banana."
1449,2,3,15,20,1.35,0.14999999999999997,520,Something's eating you up inside.
1449,3,8,29,40,1.35,0.09838438483563931,520,"It's normal to feel that you've lost your inner self at times, but I'm afraid it's permanent in your case."
1449,4,6,30,40,1.35,0.1046973660678169,520,Do you think other people ever feel empty inside?
1449,2,10,28,40,1.35,0.09163752450517142,520,How long have you felt like trash?
1456,3,9,31,43,1.3488372093023255,0.09343761535166267,520,"Just how often do you hear, ""Day-O"" ringing in your ears?"
1456,5,5,33,43,1.3488372093023255,0.10462039660958573,520,"In your case, I'd have to say the emptiness you feel inside is justified."
1458,5,6,35,46,1.3478260869565217,0.0993573130492905,520,"No, you're definitely not a nutcase."
1459,3,11,35,49,1.346938775510204,0.08527177644028351,520,So tell me more about the split.

1462,2,6,21,29,1.3448275862068966,0.1139944479350358,520,Now let's discuss why you let people walk all over you.
1462,2,6,21,29,1.3448275862068966,0.1139944479350358,520,We all sometimes feel like second banana.
1462,3,4,22,29,1.3448275862068966,0.12432935432634445,520,"This may sound unprofessional, but I find you appealing"
1462,3,4,22,29,1.3448275862068966,0.12432935432634445,520,You must have felt very exposed.
1466,3,5,24,32,1.34375,0.11543549204027609,520,"I'm just constantly getting stepped on, you know?"
1466,1,9,22,32,1.34375,0.09640069895008291,520,Can you say more about what is inside you?
1466,3,5,24,32,1.34375,0.11543549204027609,520,What else do you feel besides emptiness?
1466,2,7,23,32,1.34375,0.10634483433774572,520,"Well, it's about what is on the inside that matters, and maybe that is your problem."
1466,3,5,24,32,1.34375,0.11543549204027609,520,"After all these sessions, I was hoping that we could finally go a little deeper than ""I come from a strange bunch."""
1466,3,5,24,32,1.34375,0.11543549204027609,520,My wife says I've lost my appeal.
1466,2,7,23,32,1.34375,0.10634483433774572,520,"...and how long have you felt this sense of emptiness, this loss of purpose?"

1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,So slapstick comedy felt patronizing?
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,You said you are not a peeling?
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,"You say your mother loved apples, pears and peaches but not you?"
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,Yes...I'd say you probably have gone bananas
1669,1,9,24,34,1.3235294117647058,0.09173110587384192,520,It's time you acknowledge the split.
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,He hollowed me out then treated me like garbage.
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,So now you feel like the one slipping?
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,You're comparing apples to oranges.
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,Tell me again about that dream where a clown steps on you.
1669,1,9,24,34,1.3235294117647058,0.09173110587384192,520,"Yes, I've heard that ""Freudian slip"" joke before..."
1669,1,9,24,34,1.3235294117647058,0.09173110587384192,520,Can you tell me more about this reoccuring dream you have about being stepped on?
1669,0,11,23,34,1.3235294117647058,0.08143748885213797,520,This is not about my shoes.
1669,1,9,24,34,1.3235294117647058,0.09173110587384192,520,"'So, you've just split with your better half'."
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,It can certainly be a burden when people keep falling for you.
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,It was just a Freudian slip.
1669,1,9,24,34,1.3235294117647058,0.09173110587384192,520,When did you first discover you were accident prone?
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,Don't define yourself as accident prone; they don't have to step on you.
1669,4,3,27,34,1.3235294117647058,0.11731235812021552,520,That’s a slippery slope.
1669,4,3,27,34,1.3235294117647058,0.11731235812021552,520,When did you first notice that you were losing appeal?
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,"Well you're no Clooney, but you do have a peel."
1669,4,3,27,34,1.3235294117647058,0.11731235812021552,520,Interesting... When did your parents split?
1669,1,9,24,34,1.3235294117647058,0.09173110587384192,520,I think you have a split personality.
1669,0,11,23,34,1.3235294117647058,0.08143748885213797,520,"Shall we explore why you're feeling ""easily bruised""?"
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,"Sometimes a doctor falls for the patient, but you aren't appealing to me."
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,If you say 'Freudian slip' one more time I'm ending our session early.
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,Why do you feel empty inside?
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,And it's never your fault?
1669,1,9,24,34,1.3235294117647058,0.09173110587384192,520,Are you surprised you let that slip?
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,"Let's explore ""I feel empty inside""."
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,When did you first realize that you had a foot fetish?
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,"When around your peers, do you feel comfortable in your own peel?"
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,"While I do find you appealing, you should know I don't date my patients."
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,Please stay on the couch so you don't make a Freudian slip.
1669,0,11,23,34,1.3235294117647058,0.08143748885213797,520,"I've told you, my potassium levels are just fine."
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,Slippery situation you have there.
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,I'm tired of people just walking all over me.
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,Just start by telling me how you peel.
1669,2,7,25,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10098082480913838,520,"Doc, I have this fear of sidewalks"
1669,3,5,26,34,1.3235294117647058,0.10945162480945542,520,Tell me how you're peeling today
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"Yes, I can see how it would be very painful that you never got any of the acclaim that all your comedy partners enjoyed."
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,"So, you say it's Splitsville."
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,it's not your fault people keep slipping
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"Yes, I know a cigar is just a cigar."
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,Diagnosis: split personality disorder.
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"Yes, I gave you the AARP discount."
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,So you feel you've been discarded?
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,And how are things going with your friends? Are you still hanging with the same bunch?
1732,3,4,24,31,1.3225806451612903,0.11719936854570935,520,"It sounds like you feel like you're losing your grip on things, is that correct?"
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,"""A 'slippery slope'? Tell me more about that feeling""."
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"I mean I'm falling apart but, mostly, I feel just empty."
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,Tell me why you feel empty inside.
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"Doc, I'm worried I'm bipolar; sometimes I feel like a banana and other times a plantain"
1732,4,2,25,31,1.3225806451612903,0.12604058720079658,520,About an hour ago I woke up in the garbage can with this empty feeling.
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,That's what we call a Freudian slip
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,"So tell me, why do you think everyone considers you a joke?"
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,Can you go back to the part where you said you felt like your heart went through a blender?
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"The same nightmare again, being eaten alive?"
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,I disagree. Not everything's a Freudian slip.
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,Whether or not I find you appealing is hardly the point here...
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,"When I said, ""let's peel back some layers,"" I did not mean physically..."
1732,1,8,22,31,1.3225806451612903,0.09713195518826852,520,Life hasn't been the same since the split
1732,3,4,24,31,1.3225806451612903,0.11719936854570935,520,"I swear if they are going to stick a ""gluten free"" sticker on me I will lose my mind."
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,How do you feel about the split?
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"Yes, but have you considered that you wanted to make them slip?"
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,It was a bad split.
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,What makes you think she purposefully left you behind?
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"Yes, throwing yourself on the floor as someone walks by, is a form of co-dependence."
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,You let people walk over you once and it's a slippery slope!
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,"I'm tired of being called the ""fall guy""."
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,Forget me. Let's stay focused on you and how you jazz up your own damn corn flakes.
1732,2,6,23,31,1.3225806451612903,0.107634354892406,520,Do you suppose it's the loss of your inner self?
1764,1,7,20,28,1.3214285714285714,0.10355546310079275,520,So when did you first feel like you had a split personality?
1764,0,9,19,28,1.3214285714285714,0.08987898137227081,520,"I know you say you just happened to be on the sidewalk, but do you think unconsciously you wanted him to fall?"
1764,1,7,20,28,1.3214285714285714,0.10355546310079275,520,I'm sure it was just a Freudian slip.
1764,2,5,21,28,1.3214285714285714,0.11562541495502748,520,Let's peel back the emotional skin on your relationship with your Nana.
1764,1,7,20,28,1.3214285714285714,0.10355546310079275,520,Let's start with your early pollination.
1764,2,5,21,28,1.3214285714285714,0.11562541495502748,520,You're not a joke.
1764,2,5,21,28,1.3214285714285714,0.11562541495502748,520,Perhaps you feel that way because you actually are empty on the inside. ['are' should be underlined]
1764,1,7,20,28,1.3214285714285714,0.10355546310079275,520,The separation anxiety is easier to treat than the hollow feeling.
1764,4,10,42,56,1.3214285714285714,0.08101283711465418,520,Looks like it's been an hour. Time for you to split.
1764,4,1,23,28,1.3214285714285714,0.13660249585760717,520,You need to make amends with your bunch

1774,3,10,37,50,1.32,0.08300479455047971,520,When did you first feel like you had lost your appeal?
1774,2,4,19,25,1.32,0.12543258481484518,520,When did you first realize you were going bananas?
1777,1,11,29,41,1.3170731707317074,0.08144296515640975,520,It must feel terrible to have everyone fall all over you
1777,2,9,30,41,1.3170731707317074,0.08861415670529244,520,"So you think your life is on the skids, do you?"

1780,3,6,29,38,1.3157894736842106,0.1005338747316337,520,You have to come to terms with why he split.
1780,2,8,28,38,1.3157894736842106,0.09319112008056446,520,"Feeling empty is only natural, but do try to stay off of sidewalks."
1783,1,9,25,35,1.3142857142857143,0.08955002893954435,520,You need to stop punishing yourself for causing her downfall.
1783,3,5,27,35,1.3142857142857143,0.10667967107602253,520,Looks like you've already peeled back the layers.
1783,1,9,25,35,1.3142857142857143,0.08955002893954435,520,Doesn't tripping people seem like a passive-aggressive way of managing your feelings?
1783,2,7,26,35,1.3142857142857143,0.09848796856459571,520,Maybe it's time for you to accept that marbles are just funnier.
1783,2,7,26,35,1.3142857142857143,0.09848796856459571,520,"On a positive note, I can safely say you are not nuts."
1783,3,5,27,35,1.3142857142857143,0.10667967107602253,520,Your confused? I'm talking to a banana with mother issues.
1783,3,5,27,35,1.3142857142857143,0.10667967107602253,520,I feel like people are always stepping on me
1783,2,7,26,35,1.3142857142857143,0.09848796856459571,520,So you're saying you feel very empty inside?
1783,4,3,28,35,1.3142857142857143,0.1142857142857143,520,And then the ice cream up and split.
1783,3,5,27,35,1.3142857142857143,0.10667967107602253,520,I can see your appeal.
1783,2,7,26,35,1.3142857142857143,0.09848796856459571,520,"Firstly, it's unethical for me to date a patient. And secondly, you're a banana."
1783,1,9,25,35,1.3142857142857143,0.08955002893954435,520,But I feel like a vegetable.
1783,4,3,28,35,1.3142857142857143,0.1142857142857143,520,Maybe you should just be grateful. The cartoon business has gotten you this far.
1783,4,3,28,35,1.3142857142857143,0.1142857142857143,520,"You have to learn to face the ugly truth; after this election, slapstick is dead."
1783,2,7,26,35,1.3142857142857143,0.09848796856459571,520,When did this feeling of emptiness inside begin?
1783,3,5,27,35,1.3142857142857143,0.10667967107602253,520,"No, therapy is not a slippery slope."
1783,1,9,25,35,1.3142857142857143,0.08955002893954435,520,Let's talk about the bruises.
1783,2,7,26,35,1.3142857142857143,0.09848796856459571,520,I'd like to discuss what happened at the zoo.

1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"How do you mean, ""empty""?"
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,Okay... you met the gorilla your dreams... and then what?
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,But why do you think you feel so empty inside?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,And how did the split make you feel?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,You can't appeal to everyone.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,When they called you yellow..how did that make you peel?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,when did this sense of emptiness begin and how do you feel about it?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"From what you've told me in our sessions, you may suffer from split personality disorder."
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Still feeling empty inside?
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,After what you've experienced I'm not suprised that you feel empty inside.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Why do you think people step all over you?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,I don't think he meant disrespect by calling you 'chiquita.'
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"Yes, you are THE slippery slope."
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,Tell me more about this feeling that your life is just a series of jokes.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,What's this about Harry Belafonte?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,Do you often have these urges to expose yourself?
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,I'm referring you to another therapist who does not have food issues.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,This Trump hairpiece idea is a delusion.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"And in this dream, what is in your pocket?"
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Sometimes I just feel so empty inside.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,"You're not alone, Mr. Thompson -- people tell ME that I'm not a real therapist."
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Stop obsessing about your black spots. You look great for two days old.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,What I'm gathering from our conversation is that you feel empty inside.
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,Elaborate on how you and your bunch slipped across the border.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Why do you hurt the people who are closest to you?
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,"Now that you've finally opened up, I can see that you're truly empty inside."
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,It might be something as simple as having 'Low T'...
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,I'm tired of people walking all over me.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,You're a banana peel. Of course people hate you. I hate you.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,And what exactly makes you feel these slips are Freudian?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,When did you first realize you are an empty suit?
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,I think that we are on a slippery subject here.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"So, it's obvious why you're here. You should know I charge a bunch."
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"Yes, I find you appealing. Is that wrong?"
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,You may have lost your inner self by trying to nourish others
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,He left you. How does that make you peel?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,I see you've already met my therapy dog.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,"Yes, you have no banana!"
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,Let's work through your guilt feelings about the fall.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,At least you're no longer green with envy.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Let's talk about your split.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,Do you feel guilty about making so many others slip up?
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"Well no, that's not really what ""Freudian slip"" means..."
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"If you weren't my therapist and I wasn't a banana, would you...."
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"That's just your paranoia, not everyone thinks you're a joke."
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,So tell me. When exactly did you start feeling things slipping away?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,I see what you're doing! Peeling me with your eyes.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,Yes. There is more to life than just pratfalls.
1998,1,10,29,40,1.3,0.08164965809277262,520,Why do you feel that he won't fall for you?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,They laugh at you because they fear you.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,When did you start having this feeling of emptiness?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,Do you think all women find you appealing?
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"It is sad you lost Grandma, but there are millions of other Nanas out there."
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,You've slipped a little since our last session.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"""Can we talk about this latest slip?"
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,Let’s circle back to your comment about feeling empty inside.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,I find you very apealing.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,So how did that make you feel when you got stepped on?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,"Your delusions have taken on a decidedly realistic character, Mr. Cavendish!"
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,She got under your skin but we can work on it.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"Whenever I slip up, everyone laughs."
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,"And instead of taking me to the compost, this putz had the nerve to dump me in the trash, like I'm garbage or something."
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"So, you're always getting stepped on."
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Slips happen
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"Yellow is a color, not an emotion."
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,You say it feels like everyone in your life keeps slipping away?
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"When I told you last week to work on being more appealing to others, I didn't think you'd take me literally."
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"I have a Ph.d. in psychology, abnormal psychology, and a frequent shopper's card at the Fruit Emporium."
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,Why do you say you´ve lost your inner self?
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,Why do you think it was a Freudian slip?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,"...and then there was the time my own Freuder –ahem– father, slipped on me!"
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,And so then the banana split?
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,You can't keep putting yourself in those situations.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,"No, your lack of tears doesn't surprise me. Most banana peels take two years to break down."
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,It wasn't your fault-she slipped and fell!
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"Have you considered that you really are all peel, no banana?"
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,My parents split.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,You're not top banana anymore and that's got you depressed.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,So he decided to split with you on Sunday over another banana?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,You fear being purposely thrown down so someone can slip on you?
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,So you're saying that it wasn't your decision to split?
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,They're not laughing at you. They're laughing at what you've caused.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Try thinking of yourself as a simple fruit instead of a complex carb.
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,"Doc, I'm just sick of always getting stepped on."
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,Tell me more about these feelings of emptiness.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,It sounds like a classic Freudian slip.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,"OK, can I now speak to Mr. Apple?"
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,I come from a blended family.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,People say I bring them down
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,Tell me more about these abandonment issues.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"Sorry, you can't copyright the Freudian slip."
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,I was the only one in my bunch who didn't make Chiquita.
1998,1,7,22,30,1.3,0.09767410038007757,520,Well most of my patients ARE fruits!
1998,4,1,25,30,1.3,0.12820601237537732,520,Sounds like you've been slipping up.
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,I can see how that moment left you empty inside.
1998,3,3,24,30,1.3,0.118903032065977,520,This recent split really took a toll on me
1998,0,9,21,30,1.3,0.0850962943396763,520,"If you don't talk about your feelings, I'm afraid you'll just slip back into your old habits."
1998,2,5,23,30,1.3,0.10880753861644933,520,"So, you just split?"
1998,4,4,32,40,1.3,0.10253204627247287,520,. . . and you said you went . . . what?
2138,4,9,44,57,1.2982456140350878,0.07901695624277917,520,"It doesn't matter what anyone says, you do have appeal."
2139,3,8,36,47,1.297872340425532,0.08556766756593656,520,"Internal medicine is not my forte, but I believe your potassium level is slipping."
2140,2,7,28,37,1.2972972972972974,0.09384084079279124,520,"So, have you always thought of yourself as 'appealing'?"
2140,3,5,29,37,1.2972972972972974,0.10152637540166345,520,And you were still living as a male then?
2140,4,3,30,37,1.2972972972972974,0.10866971244878214,520,"What you are saying is that after being a comedy movie prop for so long, you think that you would like to direct."
2140,3,5,29,37,1.2972972972972974,0.10152637540166345,520,"You know, Doctor, I don't think switching chairs is helping."
2140,1,9,27,37,1.2972972972972974,0.08546696378833456,520,And why do you think you don't feel complete?
2140,4,3,30,37,1.2972972972972974,0.10866971244878214,520,"No more Freudian slip jokes, OK?"
2140,1,9,27,37,1.2972972972972974,0.08546696378833456,520,At what point did you realize you were going bananas?
2140,3,5,29,37,1.2972972972972974,0.10152637540166345,520,Maybe you should embrace the fact that you can be funny and scary at the same instant.
2140,3,5,29,37,1.2972972972972974,0.10152637540166345,520,I'm so tired of being blamed for everybody's slip-ups!
2149,3,13,48,64,1.296875,0.06929236820651079,520,"Have you ever considered that maybe they're not laughing at you, that maybe they're laughing with you."
2150,1,6,20,27,1.2962962962962963,0.10425170634491158,520,"You can't peel back more layers, or you won't?"
2150,2,4,21,27,1.2962962962962963,0.11712139482105106,520,That empty feeling could take you down a slippery slope...
2150,1,6,20,27,1.2962962962962963,0.10425170634491158,520,"So why do you feel that ""It's all a big joke""?"
2150,1,6,20,27,1.2962962962962963,0.10425170634491158,520,"One more Freudian slip and you will have to find another therapist, ok?"
2150,2,4,21,27,1.2962962962962963,0.11712139482105106,520,"You feel you are an accident waiting to happen, part of some cosmic, slapstick joke?"
2150,1,6,20,27,1.2962962962962963,0.10425170634491158,520,One more Freudian slip joke and this session is over.
2150,2,4,21,27,1.2962962962962963,0.11712139482105106,520,I feel you slipping away
2150,2,4,21,27,1.2962962962962963,0.11712139482105106,520,It's because I was discarded that made me hurt other people.
2150,2,12,40,54,1.2962962962962963,0.07301833256126636,520,And how did it make you feel when he treated you like discarded trash?
2150,1,6,20,27,1.2962962962962963,0.10425170634491158,520,What's eating you this time?
2150,3,2,22,27,1.2962962962962963,0.12871062106070102,520,What did you expect? You were smothering her.
2161,1,11,32,44,1.2954545454545454,0.07679869525286717,520,Okay. So you're tired of being set up as the fall guy.
2161,3,7,34,44,1.2954545454545454,0.0895109183139428,520,Freudian slip jokes? You're right. Not funny.
2163,3,12,46,61,1.2950819672131149,0.07145735973017497,520,Good news and bad news: You are not delusional
2164,2,6,26,34,1.2941176470588236,0.09927914663561015,520,Tell me about the clowns again.
2164,2,6,26,34,1.2941176470588236,0.09927914663561015,520,"What you're describing is separation anxiety and, given your time together, that's perfectly normal."
2164,2,6,26,34,1.2941176470588236,0.09927914663561015,520,It doesn't matter what I think. Do YOU think your life has been one big joke?
2164,1,8,25,34,1.2941176470588236,0.089854425391291,520,I've never felt more fruitless.
2164,2,6,26,34,1.2941176470588236,0.09927914663561015,520,And since when have you had this feeling of emptiness?
2164,2,11,38,51,1.2941176470588236,0.07563647655680751,520,"No, I don't think you're all peel and no banana."
2164,3,4,27,34,1.2941176470588236,0.10788364172102682,520,What does 'produce' mean to you?
2164,1,8,25,34,1.2941176470588236,0.089854425391291,520,Is that a banana peel on my couch? Or are you just glad to see me?
2164,3,4,27,34,1.2941176470588236,0.10788364172102682,520,And just what makes you think you're not appealing?
2164,1,8,25,34,1.2941176470588236,0.089854425391291,520,"I agree. It's definitely hate speech to use the term ""Going bananas""."
2164,2,6,26,34,1.2941176470588236,0.09927914663561015,520,"Yes, I promise, no Freudian slip jokes."
2164,2,6,26,34,1.2941176470588236,0.09927914663561015,520,And how long have you had this feeling of everyone wanting you to be stepped on?
2164,1,8,25,34,1.2941176470588236,0.089854425391291,520,So you finally fulfilled your fantasy about oral sex.

2164,1,8,25,34,1.2941176470588236,0.089854425391291,520,"So, why do you find it distasteful when she calls you her top banana?"
2164,1,8,25,34,1.2941176470588236,0.089854425391291,520,You need to stop letting people step all over you.
2164,1,8,25,34,1.2941176470588236,0.089854425391291,520,"You're not an enabler, everyone has a slip now and then"
2182,1,5,18,24,1.2916666666666667,0.11227500313294327,520,What eats you?

2185,3,3,25,31,1.2903225806451613,0.11540996012902142,520,You are experiencing a kind of penis envy...
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,"I said, ""Reveal your INNER self!"

2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,"You lost a part of yourself that day, so it's not uncommon to still feel bruised from the experience."
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,"Then she got all nuts, so I split."
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,"Once and for all, it's never coming back."
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,We generally don't mean banana peels when we talk about Freudian slips.
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,"This void you feel, I'm afraid it is real."
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,It seems like everything is one big punchline to you.
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,"Yes, anyone can blame you, but why do you accept that blame?"
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,I know you are a peeling but that's not what I meant
2185,0,9,22,31,1.2903225806451613,0.08287246824945246,520,When we peel back the layers you'll realize you're not to blame for others fallings.
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,A man stepped on you...go on...
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,Exactly when did you feel your relationship start to slip?
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,"Yes, it's a very slippery slope"

2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,I don't know if she slipped away because I'm empty or if I'm empty because she slipped away.
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,Our time's up. Please slip on out the side door.

2185,0,9,22,31,1.2903225806451613,0.08287246824945246,520,"So you're saying that these feelings of unworthiness, of inadequacy, came just after you were named Top Banana?"
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,"Aha, when did you start feeling ""empty?"""
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,Don't be hard on yourself - the guy who just left here was a real nut!
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,I don't know if I should help you or compost you.
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,When did you first start to feel unappealing?
2185,0,9,22,31,1.2903225806451613,0.08287246824945246,520,And what makes you think they're not laughing with you?
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,"I used to get a million laughs, then along came attorneys"
2185,1,7,23,31,1.2903225806451613,0.09496517060567579,520,How does the split make you feel?
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,I want to make sure I'm understanding...what I'm hearing you say is that you feel people are avoiding you when they walk into a room and they see you?
2185,2,5,24,31,1.2903225806451613,0.10568311720693004,520,I just feel that life is slipping by me

2222,1,6,21,28,1.2857142857142858,0.10101525445522108,520,That's getting into a slippery slope.
2222,1,6,21,28,1.2857142857142858,0.10101525445522108,520,So tell me how you are peeling today.

2306,1,6,22,29,1.2758620689655173,0.09796641281453865,520,I won't give a group rate for a split personality.
2306,1,6,22,29,1.2758620689655173,0.09796641281453865,520,It's normal. I'd say that most peels feel empty inside.
2306,2,4,23,29,1.2758620689655173,0.10982018132811801,520,I told you I was going bananas.

2306,2,4,23,29,1.2758620689655173,0.10982018132811801,520,And how does it feel to no longer be a phallic symbol?
2306,1,6,22,29,1.2758620689655173,0.09796641281453865,520,How long have you felt that people avoid you?

2306,1,6,22,29,1.2758620689655173,0.09796641281453865,520,"So, you think your slipping and something inside you is missing?"
2306,2,4,23,29,1.2758620689655173,0.10982018132811801,520,So what makes you think you aren't appealing?

2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,How do you think I peel?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,It could very well be that people keep giving you the slip because you're just too appealing!
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,50 years since “Mellow Yellow”... . forget about being a sudden craze
2558,3,1,23,27,1.2592592592592593,0.12622722459758245,520,So how do you peel?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,I don't peel too well.
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,So you think your divorce took a lot out of you?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,You'll have to be hospitalized. You're a danger to others.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,I believe you may have banana-split-personality.
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,Don't look at my legs and I won't look at your skin.
2558,3,1,23,27,1.2592592592592593,0.12622722459758245,520,"""I've been feeling better about the split, but I can't get over the fact that she just took everything and tossed me out the window like a banana peel""."
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"Was that a slip, or are you holding yourself responsible?"
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,It's just a Freudian slip; let's move on.
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,It's separation anxiety. But you still have appeal.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,So you're telling me that you think people walk all over you.
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,But how do you feel when people walk on you?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,And when did you develop this irrational fear of apes?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Fruitless? Yellow? Slippery? Can you be more specific?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Causing pratfalls is an attempt to compensate for your impotence.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"Peel back the layers of denial, and what're we left with?"
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,No you're not paranoid you do make people slip up
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,No. I'm pretty sure Freud wouldn't have appreciated that kind of slip.
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,Transitioning into observational comedy is a slippery slope.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,And you say you’re tired of being walked on?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,I just feel so lonely since she split.
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,Do you really believe that there is no such thing as an accident?
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,"Again, I apologize... But surely can understand why someone might titter when you say you have a 'bunch' of problems."
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,So how much has this separation cost you?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,So when did your partner split?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"So she told you that you have ""a peel,"" but no substance underneath, hmm?"
2558,3,1,23,27,1.2592592592592593,0.12622722459758245,520,I just can't shake this schadenfreude...
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"I still feel terrified whenever someone mentions monkeys, or zoos."
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,It all started when my parents split
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"Yes, most peels go through separation anxiety."
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,I don't know - somehow I feel as if things are just slipping away.
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,I think this is a classic case of splitting.
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,I'd like us to focus on your early relationship with the bunch.
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,Your guilt is from a Freudian slip.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,It's only normal to be experiencing separation anxiety.
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,I really can't win for losing; I'm either over or under ripe!
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,How long have you felt you've lost your true inner essence?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,So when did you start blaming yourself for the slips of others?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,I've been robbed of my sex appeal.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"Let me get this: ""Peel peel bo-beel, Banana-fana po’ feel?"""
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,I know — it's not funny when people avoid you.
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"This feeling of emptiness, is it after the slip and fall?"
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,"...I know, Rachael, but I assure you--you're genetically modified to NOT become your mother."
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Have you attempted suicide before?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Orange you glad you split?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"'' But Nana, tell me why you feel so empty.''"
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,Clearly that ice cream parlor incident led to your split personality
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,He blames you?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"You have every right to feel ""discarded""!"
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,I'm sorry but 'Going Bananas' is not a billable diagnosis.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Freudian slip duly noted.
2558,3,1,23,27,1.2592592592592593,0.12622722459758245,520,"So, you think you are responsible for the slipups of others?"
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,The good news is you're not going bananas. The bad news is it's cause you're already there.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"Yes, it is an unusually long time to remain in the phallic stage."
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,You say you feel empty inside. Why do you think that is?
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,"So, I see you have lost your inner being. Tell me more."
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,You always feel stepped on?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,And how did it make you feel. . . being tossed out on the sidewalk?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"So, since the split you've felt empty?"
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Is this some sort of joke?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,i guess you slipped up when you split...
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,It's just that I feel so empty inside....
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,"Are you insecure about always being the ""fall guy""?"
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Admitting that the slip was Freudian has been a major breakthrough.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Why do you feel its not easy being green?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"As Freud said, 'Sometimes it's just a banana...."
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,You're depressed because no one finds you appealing?
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,And when did you first feel like you were going bananas?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"Let's discuss your fear of fruit-based puns. What do you find so unappealing about them? Is it just that you've heard them a bunch? Sorry, I'm going to split."
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,So my wife got nuts and I split.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,You have to stop blaming yourself.
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"So for once, you feel that you slipped up?"
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,How about we get in touch with your inner fruit?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Size doesn't always matter.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"So, when did people start calling you passive aggressive?"
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,Split personality ?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"It was a difficult split and I know you may never get over it, but I'm sorry to say that's how sundaes are made..."
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"So you feel that to be called ""Chiquita"" is sexist . . . ?"
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,So how long were you and this 'Chiquita' engaged?
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,Is it possible she might just be clumsy?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,I've never felt tallied.
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,"So, he slipped. We all slip."
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"Lets get past the fact that you are garbage, and move on to relationships."
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,How long has it been since the banana split?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,And she said i was to blame for her freudian slips!
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,Why do you feel ice cream shops are the cause of your split personality?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,I think I know just the thing to help with your feelings of emptiness.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,So just when did you split
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"I was born on a plantation, moved to Hollywood but then I slipped up.......now I'm just a second banana."
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,My whole life has been a joke.....
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"And so this reckless impulse to make people slip and fall, this started after the smoothie incident?"
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,Sometimes you work so hard to peel away a patient's exterior persona and there's just bupkis underneath it all.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Let's begin with why you feel like you are prone to so many slipups.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,Do you often feel empty inside?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,You're not a nut case.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,So explain to me again why it's NOT what's on the inside that matters...
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,At what point did you start to feel him slipping away?
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,My wife says I'm no longer her top banana.
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,"So you're depressed because your banana split, is that correct?"
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,You have to stop being the scapegoat for everyone else's slip ups!
2558,3,1,23,27,1.2592592592592593,0.12622722459758245,520,When did you first feel like your life was just slipping away?
2558,2,3,22,27,1.2592592592592593,0.11438666609620929,520,"Maybe it's just transference, but I find you appealing, too."
2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,I think we're split on this issue...

2558,1,5,21,27,1.2592592592592593,0.10116969176390143,520,It really isn't what's inside that counts
2558,0,7,20,27,1.2592592592592593,0.08594360757264019,520,And when did you first notice everything was slipping away?

2883,1,5,23,29,1.2413793103448276,0.09488354819831636,520,No one will step on me . . .
2883,1,5,23,29,1.2413793103448276,0.09488354819831636,520,I just can't get over the split.
2883,2,3,24,29,1.2413793103448276,0.10707913851864116,520,Your guilt complex isn't difficult to understand.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Things just haven't been the same since hover boards.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,And you said you feel that people don't find you appealing?
2905,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,520,You were telling me about your obsessive thoughts that everyone goes out of their way to avoid you.
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,Don't tell me you've slipped again
2905,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,520,Freudian slips are the least of my problems.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"It's not love, it's Doctor-peel transference"
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,That's confidential. Banana is also my client.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Your diagnosis is split personality.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Sounds like empty-peel syndrome.
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,It seems you still exhibit hostility about your childhood on the plantation.
2905,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,520,"Believe me, beauty IS skin deep."
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,My diagnosis is that you fear everyone you meet is going to fall down.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Explain to me why you feel people look at you as slippery and that you have no appeal.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,I don't make people laugh anymore.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"Sure you have thick skin, but I also detect pathological narcissism and a sensitivity stemming from unrealistic expectations."
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,You have to move past this. People slip on things all the time.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,I just feel like they just keep stepping on me.
2905,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,520,I need you to open up more.
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,"It's not what is your problem, but what are you?"
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"No, Mr. Peel, I do not want to slip on something more comfortable."
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"Now, tell me why you and your wife split."
2905,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,520,"And then, she just slipped ..."
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,What makes you say that you aren't getting any traction in your relationships?
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,"Well, so much for self-actualization."
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Gotta be a split personality. I'd bet a month of sundaes on it.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"While I also find you appealing, we must keep this professional."
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Tell me more about your struggle with 'split' personality.
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,What about transitioning straight to mulch?
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,This must've been a devastating split-up.
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,"I understand you feel empty, but you are appealing."
2905,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,520,I think it is narcissistic of you to think that everyone falls for you.
2905,0,6,19,25,1.24,0.0871779788708135,520,And how do you feel when she says you are not apeeling?
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Every slip isn't necessarily Freudian.
2905,3,0,22,25,1.24,0.13266499161421602,520,We're here for you to peel back the layers. Don't bunch it all up inside.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,How long have you had this empty feeling?
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,That plum job can still be yours.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"They're not completely without fault. After all, yellow does signal caution."
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,So tell me more about Daiquiri.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Everything was great in Costa Rica. Now I'm feeling somewhat discarded.
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,So you feel you have a split personality?
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,You feel the hilarity of someone slipping on you doesn’t compensate you for the pain of being stepped on? I’m sorry – I treat standup comedians on Thursdays only.
2905,2,2,21,25,1.24,0.1194431524477928,520,Your parents were in a split when you were younger?
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,...and you think subconsciously you wanted him to slip?
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"So, tell me about this new emptiness you feel, and why you think you're such a danger to others."
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,Can you tell me more about the man that ate you?
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"So, let's explore why you enjoy watching people slip."
2905,1,4,20,25,1.24,0.10456258094238749,520,"So you're saying due to the popularity if plantains, you ego is now bruised?"
2952,1,3,17,21,1.2380952380952381,0.11761037176408067,520,So you feel like part of you has been missing ever since the incident with the gorilla?
2952,0,5,16,21,1.2380952380952381,0.09523809523809525,520,When did you first start having nightmares of gorillas?
2952,1,3,17,21,1.2380952380952381,0.11761037176408067,520,"Berry, I know you are misunderstood, but you have thick skin."
2952,1,3,17,21,1.2380952380952381,0.11761037176408067,520,"So when you yelled back, 'Eat my lunch, Buddy!' what did you expect?"
2952,1,3,17,21,1.2380952380952381,0.11761037176408067,520,But what about MY peelings!
2952,1,8,33,42,1.2380952380952381,0.0747393753458591,520,"Now, Mr. banana peel you said you like to give people the slip... tell me more about that."
2952,2,1,18,21,1.2380952380952381,0.13636020060263193,520,Your slip is showing.
2952,1,3,17,21,1.2380952380952381,0.11761037176408067,520,So when did you start feeling that you had lost your appeal?
2960,0,9,29,38,1.236842105263158,0.06989334006042335,520,Thank you; I find you appealing too.
2960,0,9,29,38,1.236842105263158,0.06989334006042335,520,So what time of the day do you find yourself more appealing?
2962,3,6,42,51,1.2352941176470589,0.07714633558002353,520,'Tell me more about how you think the chimpanzee was using you in your relationship.'
2962,2,4,28,34,1.2352941176470589,0.09496057470137043,520,I was doing so well and then I slipped.
2962,2,4,28,34,1.2352941176470589,0.09496057470137043,520,"You're tired of slippery jokes, I get that; but let's peel back another layer."
2965,2,7,38,47,1.2340425531914894,0.07581055041090795,520,"I know, it’s a such cliché, but I’ve fallen over you…"
2966,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,520,I'm just tired of being the fall guy all the time.
2966,0,7,23,30,1.2333333333333334,0.07854032324531729,520,Let's peel back some layers of memory...
2966,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,520,So you tripped him. Then what?
2966,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,520,Why do YOU think you keep trying to give people the slip?
2966,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,520,"""That one slipped right by me""."
2966,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,520,"You know, sometimes a banana is just a banana."
2966,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,520,So size is the big issue.
2966,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,520,He always said I'm nothing without him...
2966,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,520,Let's talk about why you don't think you're a-peeling.
2966,2,3,25,30,1.2333333333333334,0.10376070318239085,520,"So, how was week's experiment with oral sex?"
2966,1,5,24,30,1.2333333333333334,0.09201865544655373,520,"So you feel empty, rejected and slippery"
2966,3,1,26,30,1.2333333333333334,0.11430281754889884,520,"Yes, you could say we both make a lot of 'bread'."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,When did you start feeling as though people were always stepping on you?
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"We got into a big argument, and than she split."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,Tell me why you feel life is slipping away.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"For me, it was love; but he only wanted my flesh."
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"I dunno doc, it just feels like the whole world is slipping away from me."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,So how would you describe your appeal?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Why do you think your always tripping people up?
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,Therapy just never seemed appealing
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,I have become a couch potato
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,And when did you first feel yourself slipping?
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"And why do YOU think they won't consider you for dramatic roles, Miss Peel?"
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Or...could the reason you feel empty inside stem back to your childhood?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,It's so difficult for me to peel back any more layers
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,I hear you saying you feel empty and wonder if you still have appeal?
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,You're only bananas when you're with the rest of your bunch.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,It's biological.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,No more weddings.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Don't blame yourself! He took a Freudian slip.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"The truth is, no one _really_ falls for your type."
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,I don't think she meant to say your existence was banal.
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,You're saying everyone you love always slips up.
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,It sounds like someone used you and just split.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"So, you're feeling a bit split lately? I think I can dole you out a prescription."
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"Gretta, life isn't always going to be vitamins C, B-6 and potassium."
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,I always wondered what made a Freudian slip.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,So I presume you need help with the recent split?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"Okay, so no one's ever slipped on you, get over it!"
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,When did you first realize that you were losing your grip.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"What do you mean when you say you feel ""empty inside""?"
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,And how does that make you feel when someone steps on you?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,It's time for a change. You're empty inside. Your words are slippery; your behavior's rotten.
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,Nonsense. You are a peeling.
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,I'm diagnosing you with a Split Personality
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,That's quite the Freudian slip.
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"You can choose to focus on what you've lost, or you can focus on the happiness you've brought to others."
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Well THAT'S a slippery slope.
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"So you would say that leaving the others in the bunch was liberating at first, right?"
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,So you're feeling a void?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Was it Freudian?
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,And tell me again why you think people laugh at you
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,And just why do you feel Donald Trump's hair is making fun of you?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"Sure, no cholesterol, low fat, great potassium, but I still feel dissatisfied..."
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,I'm afraid we don't accept patients on the Dole
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Tell me more about your feeling of emptiness.
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,I've overcome the abandonment issues and my addiction to slapstick comedy but the personal injury lawsuits are killing me
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,So tell me how you felt the first time someone slipped on you.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,And why do you think that your life is slipping away?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,And did you feel this way before you were peeled?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"Once again, why did yor date fall for you?"
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,Sometimes a banana doesn't want to be just a banana.
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,I'm worried I'm going to start slipping again.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"Great, another manspreader..."
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,So you had a slip up...
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,I guess you are just a Freudian slip.
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,So today i wanted us to focus on your bananal fixation.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,I'd like to refer you to a Skinnerian.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"So, why do you think everyone falls for you?"
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Not another case of split personality disorder...
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,You're claiming that you're responsible for the Freudian slip?!
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Banana Who
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,I'm tired of always being the fall guy.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,It wasn't your fault somebody slipped on you.
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,"I know it's wrong, but I think I'm falling for you."
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"Doctor, I have this recurring dream of someone slipping on me while standing next to an open grave."
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,You sure are a mouthful.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,"We don't use the ""B"" word in psychotherapy."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"Ok, go ahead and tell me about your latest slip-up."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,So - you don't find it funny anymore?
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,It sounds to me like people weren't laughing at YOU so much as they were laughing at the entire situation.
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,How long have you felt so hollow?
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,Let's talk more about your peelings…
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"Well, Chiquita, another hour has slipped by."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"I would ask how things are going, but I see we are headed down a slippery slope."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,Why do you feel you're just a shell of your former self
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,So when did you discover just how slippery Life can be??
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"I know, I slipped up again!"
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,"Some people say I have appeal, but I feel so empty."
2978,0,6,20,26,1.2307692307692308,0.08426500884694861,520,How did you really feel after she slipped?
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,"The correct pronunciation is still ""flak´sid,"" but do go on."
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,"And so I told him, ""I wasn't asking to be eaten because I wore this."""
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,I just feel so empty inside
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,I apologize for wearing heels today... I will make a note that they are a trigger for your anxiety.
2978,2,2,22,26,1.2307692307692308,0.11512791959304433,520,I'm not falling for you -- that's transference talking.
2978,1,4,21,26,1.2307692307692308,0.10088366960464615,520,Let's role play—I'll be the banana peel and you be the one slipping

3171,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,520,"And then, she just split."

3171,1,5,25,31,1.2258064516129032,0.08931853616040941,520,Sometimes I feel like I'm the one slipping
3171,2,3,26,31,1.2258064516129032,0.10063964694019434,520,"My friends think I have appeal, but my enemies say I'm a slippery character"

3188,0,6,21,27,1.2222222222222223,0.0815332650783714,520,Let's go back to the first time someone slipped on you. How did that make you feel?
3188,2,2,23,27,1.2222222222222223,0.11111111111111109,520,I sense an alienation from your inner core.

3188,0,6,21,27,1.2222222222222223,0.0815332650783714,520,Another slip up?

3188,0,8,28,36,1.2222222222222223,0.07027283689263064,520,And then she swallowed me whole

3188,1,4,22,27,1.2222222222222223,0.09745089103411433,520,I'm just tired of being stepped on doc like I'm some joke.
3188,2,2,23,27,1.2222222222222223,0.11111111111111109,520,My inner self slipped away

3188,1,4,22,27,1.2222222222222223,0.09745089103411433,520,So you feel you're losing appeal...

3188,1,8,36,45,1.2222222222222223,0.07027283689263063,520,Sometimes a banana is just a banana. But a peel - that's when things get slippery.
3188,1,4,22,27,1.2222222222222223,0.09745089103411433,520,There are a bunch of problems I want to talk about.
3188,0,6,21,27,1.2222222222222223,0.0815332650783714,520,"""How long have you felt like you were just 'one in a bunch'?"

3188,1,4,22,27,1.2222222222222223,0.09745089103411433,520,"Frankly, I don't find this session that appealing."
3188,1,4,22,27,1.2222222222222223,0.09745089103411433,520,"How would you like it, Doc, if they ripped off all of your clothes?"

3221,1,5,26,32,1.21875,0.08676970585889242,520,Why do you think people don't find you appealing ?

3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,So you're feeling somewhere above dog poo but still below a puddle?

3227,2,1,20,23,1.2173913043478262,0.12505369185420057,520,"So in your dream, my little Chiquita, the pedestrian steps on you and falls backward into a vat of ice cream. You shout ""Cherry."" This, I'm afraid, is a classic case of Banana Split Personality."
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,"So tell me, when did your life start slipping away?"
3227,0,5,18,23,1.2173913043478262,0.08793911249520546,520,"Every time I get my life together, I cause someone else to slip."
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,I'd rather you sit. I'm a Freudian and I would hate to slip.
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,"I know I should have considered the consequences, but it was so funny in the cartoons"
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,Have you considered not trying to be funny all the time?
3227,0,5,18,23,1.2173913043478262,0.08793911249520546,520,It's usually best to establish trust before opening up to someone.
3227,0,5,18,23,1.2173913043478262,0.08793911249520546,520,I told you the flesh was weak.
3227,2,1,20,23,1.2173913043478262,0.12505369185420057,520,You're co-dependent.
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,Have you always had a fear of sidewalks?
3227,2,1,20,23,1.2173913043478262,0.12505369185420057,520,Tell me how that makes you peel.
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,"I'm flattered, but let's talk about what makes YOU appealing."
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,Most people go through life without slipping on me even once. So why does everyone treat me like I'm a piece of garbage?
3227,2,1,20,23,1.2173913043478262,0.12505369185420057,520,Was that uncomfortable for you?
3227,2,1,20,23,1.2173913043478262,0.12505369185420057,520,"At first I thought you might be suffering from a split personality, but now I’ve come to believe that you are a slippery, thin skinned, hollow shell of a fruit case."
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,"Sorry, we only do couple's therapy."
3227,2,1,20,23,1.2173913043478262,0.12505369185420057,520,So how did you feel when she said she was no longer happy to see you?
3227,0,5,18,23,1.2173913043478262,0.08793911249520546,520,Actually 'sex appeal' doesn't mean that.
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,I don't think they're laughing *at* you.
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,"OK, Why are you here today?"
3227,1,3,19,23,1.2173913043478262,0.10810114095792364,520,I'm diagnosing you a slipzophrenic.

3287,0,6,22,28,1.2142857142857142,0.07896725691322382,520,You need to get out and mingle; maybe enter a nut-loaf.

3287,1,4,23,28,1.2142857142857142,0.09424081021458665,520,Let's return to the monkey business that we were exploring in our last session.
3287,1,4,23,28,1.2142857142857142,0.09424081021458665,520,"You want Freud to slip. How about this, "" Sometimes a banana is just a banana""."

3287,0,6,22,28,1.2142857142857142,0.07896725691322382,520,It must be hard to avoid feeling discarded.
3287,2,2,24,28,1.2142857142857142,0.10736308935292606,520,Let's discuss how you keep slipping toward me on that couch...
3287,1,7,34,42,1.2142857142857142,0.0725807194981817,520,You feel like you are just one of the bunch?
3287,1,7,34,42,1.2142857142857142,0.0725807194981817,520,And you say that's when you started to feel things were slipping?
3287,1,4,23,28,1.2142857142857142,0.09424081021458665,520,And why do you believe it is your fault?
3287,2,2,24,28,1.2142857142857142,0.10736308935292606,520,You likely would've had a better result with group therapy.
3287,1,4,23,28,1.2142857142857142,0.09424081021458665,520,Forgive yourself. You didn't intend for anyone to slip.
3287,3,9,58,70,1.2142857142857142,0.06068230798361479,520,I feel so empty inside. Like I'm all eaten up.
3287,1,4,23,28,1.2142857142857142,0.09424081021458665,520,"While I'm certainly flattered, our canons of ethics prohibit any non-professional patient involvement."

3313,1,5,27,33,1.2121212121212122,0.08436006610348519,520,Perhaps you'd feel more appealing if you stopped making so many banana puns.
3313,1,5,27,33,1.2121212121212122,0.08436006610348519,520,So it was only after the split that you began feeling empty inside and noticed your work was slipping?
3315,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,520,Why do you think your parents won't let you play with the other fruits?
3316,1,2,16,19,1.2105263157894737,0.12280701754385967,520,"So, Ms. Chiquita, have you read Kafka's Metamorphosis?"
3316,1,2,16,19,1.2105263157894737,0.12280701754385967,520,I caused him to slip and fall...
3316,0,4,15,19,1.2105263157894737,0.09609167675529232,520,"Do you think they are laughing at you, or with you?"
3316,1,6,31,38,1.2105263157894737,0.07690579795683228,520,"So, you say no one finds you appealing? That's bananas."
3316,0,4,15,19,1.2105263157894737,0.09609167675529232,520,"So, why'd you split?"
3316,1,6,31,38,1.2105263157894737,0.07690579795683228,520,Naturally peeling and natural appeal are not the same thing.
3316,2,0,17,19,1.2105263157894737,0.14467037282868986,520,"So, you think it was a Freudian slip."
3316,1,2,16,19,1.2105263157894737,0.12280701754385967,520,And why do you... feel guilty... when you didn't initiate the mishap?
3316,1,6,31,38,1.2105263157894737,0.07690579795683228,520,"I definitely think your split personality, Mrs. B., stems from your chocolaholic husband desserting you."
3316,1,2,16,19,1.2105263157894737,0.12280701754385967,520,"I know, its been like three decades since the Knicks' last championship."
3316,0,4,15,19,1.2105263157894737,0.09609167675529232,520,How long before you knew you were on a slippery slope?
3316,1,2,16,19,1.2105263157894737,0.12280701754385967,520,"No, I keep telling you, that was not a Freudian slip. Maybe it's time you looked for another analyst."
3316,1,2,16,19,1.2105263157894737,0.12280701754385967,520,"You are one banana, not bananas."
3316,0,4,15,19,1.2105263157894737,0.09609167675529232,520,"Well, if your partner lacks appeal, perhaps you should just split."
3330,1,7,35,43,1.2093023255813953,0.0710476851931138,520,Fixing your low self-esteem will be a slippery slope.
3330,1,7,35,43,1.2093023255813953,0.0710476851931138,520,Give up the guilt. It wasn't your fault.
3330,0,9,34,43,1.2093023255813953,0.06277223796575146,520,"Actually, you may have to face the fact that becoming passé in slapstick might mean that now your act is rubbish.."
3330,0,9,34,43,1.2093023255813953,0.06277223796575146,520,"Yes, I understand you think those slipups were your doing, but there are wider forces in the universe you don't understand...."
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,"Sorry, but any further innuendo and we'll have to end the session."
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,"Well, despite what you have been told, I think you are certainty a-peeling."
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I'm too thin-skinned.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I suggest that you wear an outfit less provocative to work...
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,"And when did you begin feeling this sense of, well, emptiness?"
3334,2,6,40,48,1.2083333333333333,0.07267881673425383,520,So you have abandonment issues
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I can understand you're feeling used.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,"Yes, I agree, perhaps you should have seen it coming, but honestly, it happens every single day."
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,You talkin' to me?
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Relax and you'll peel better.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,You’ve got to stop dating these clowns who walk all over you and then act like it’s all a joke.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,You may want to check your potassium. I think you are over medicated.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,You'll always be appealing.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"And when you were peeled, how did that make you feel?"
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,I think you just made a banana slip.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,"You don't need a therapist to put you back together, you need a zipper."
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,She doesn't laugh at your jokes?
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,You have a lot of a-peel.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,People are always giving me the slip.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,Why do you think the family ate you?
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,Have you considered that this desire to watch me peel might be just a bit of transference?
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,You can blame your parents all you want but I still believe those bruises are natural.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"In therapy, we like to peel back your issues, do you think you might slip up?"
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Classic case of a 'split' personality.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,What can I say? I slipped up with a younger peel and the wife split. It's all so cliche.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"So, when did you notice things beginning to slip around you?"
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I am not getting paid enough for this.....
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,How long have you peeled this way?
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,You say you slipped up. But how exactly?
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,That's a very slippery slope!
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,"So, you've been feeling funny."
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"So, you're worried that girls don't find you appealing."
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,"Was it a slip, or a fall?"
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Why do you feel you are on the skids?
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,How did you feel when he slipped?
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,"I told you to break a leg, not do it to the Oscar winning actor."
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Tell me how you feel now that you are no longer top banana.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,Sounds to me like a Freudian slip.
3334,2,6,40,48,1.2083333333333333,0.07267881673425383,520,I get no respect. One slip and fall and they never let you forget it.
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,You're ripe for a Freudian slip.
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,"Okay,I get it, I get it. You slipped up badly. But how do you feel now."
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"You mean, after all these sessions, you still feel stepped on?"
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,When did you discover that your wife had an affair with a tomato?
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,I understand that it's eating you up inside. I'm just asking how you feel about that.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I'm not a piece of meat.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"Charlie Chaplin's whole career was defined by silent, physical humor, and he is a comedy legend."
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"To be clear...when you refer to ""the slip"" are we talking bedroom or sidewalk?"
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,My mother mother My mother also had a split personality.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,Quit blaming yourself. You are not the cause of a Freudian slip.
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,I'd expect that kind of remark from a cucumber.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,We've covered the emptiness -- let's talk about your mother.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,So...you say you have a history of making people fall down but you're upset when people think that's funny.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,"So, you're afraid of slipping on a human."

3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I always feel rejected

3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I believe you should concentrate on potassium not phallicism
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Then they accused me of making a Freudian slip.

3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"As your psychiatrist, I must warn you: You are on a ""slippery slope."""
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I don't think Dr. Freud was thinking of you when he was talking about Freudian slips!
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Why do you think it is your fault?
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,I think it goes back to the day my father split.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,"I realize we should maintain a professional, doctor and patient relationship, but be honest: Do I appeal to you?"
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Tell me how you peel about that.
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,You shouldn't feel inferior just because you're not labelled organic.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"I feel like I get blamed for every fall, Doc."

3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,I see that you grabbed hold of that potassium-deficiency suggestion from our last session.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,"So, your feelings of abandonment make you want to hurt people?"
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"I think you're just paranoid, everyone isn't trying to give you the slip."

3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,My divorce? What can I say? She peeled off and gave me the slip.
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,"You're a mere shell of yourself, all spent."
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,"I feel empty, used up, cast aside. I may still have some appeal, but that's all I have."
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"Now, today, where do we start: your feeling that you're squeezed out, unnoticed or simply rotten?"
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,Your sense that you lack appeal may be related to your feelings of emptiness inside.
3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,"Psycho analyst, not bananalyst."

3334,1,3,20,24,1.2083333333333333,0.10389457216622949,520,So...tell me again...why did you and your better half split?
3334,2,1,21,24,1.2083333333333333,0.12007193898409807,520,And how did you feel when the heel hit you?
3334,0,5,19,24,1.2083333333333333,0.08468112965594382,520,It sounds to me like cucumber envy.

3541,1,5,28,34,1.2058823529411764,0.08207873882240854,520,That's a pretty slippery answer to my question.
3545,2,4,33,39,1.205128205128205,0.08360539002285311,520,This is clear evidence of a split personality.

3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,And why do you feel you have lost your status as a phallic symbol?
3556,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,520,But how did it FEEL when she stepped on you?
3556,2,2,26,30,1.2,0.10057307059414874,520,Blaming someone else for your own emptiness is a slippery slope.
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,Let's talk about your split personality.
3556,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,520,What makes you think they are laughing at you and not with you?

3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,Why do you think you keep slipping?
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,I understand you feel disconnected from your inner core.
3556,0,7,28,35,1.2,0.06859943405700354,520,When exactly did you stop feeling like a banana?
3556,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,520,So what's troubling you Mr. Banana? You seem so relaxed.
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,So how did you feel when the banana split?

3556,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,520,Tell me more about your fear of being typecast.
3556,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,520,"I gave her the slip, and now she's suing."
3556,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,520,Did your fear of being composted start before or after peeling?
3556,1,4,25,30,1.2,0.08840866447369841,520,I feel unappreciated.
3556,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,520,"When he ate you up and spit you out, how did that make you feel?"
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,Your openness is what makes you appealing.
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,You are a model character for separation anxiety.
3556,1,5,29,35,1.2,0.07991592220483187,520,"Even if you are appealing, you can't expect everyone you meet to fall head over heels."
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,Then I was rejected as one of the bunch.
3556,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,520,I recommend getting in touch with your inner plantain.
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,"Surely, it was a Freudian slip."
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,I need your undivided attention.
3556,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,520,It is not your fault when someone slips.
3556,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,520,Why do you think you have a split personality?
3556,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,520,"""I constantly feel rejected""."
3556,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,520,Why do you think you lost your appeal?
3556,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,520,It's no wonder your mind was in the gutter...
3556,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,520,Stop thinking you are a banana.
3556,1,2,17,20,1.2,0.11697953037312035,520,"Tell him he can't eat the fruit, then just throw away the peel."
3556,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,520,"I don’t know, doc, I just feel all empty inside. It’s really affecting my sex life."
3556,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,520,And how did Freud slipping on you make you peel?
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,"Now that you're no longer a phallic symbol, do you still feel you have a skin in the game?"
3556,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,520,You're just experiencing common feelings of separation anxiety.
3556,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,520,Now about this sense you have that people are falling all over you ...
3556,2,2,26,30,1.2,0.10057307059414874,520,So what makes you think you're going bananas?
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,Tell me again why you find your mother so un-appealing?
3556,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,520,I appreciate what you're saying. I just don't find you appealing.
3556,2,1,22,25,1.2,0.11547005383792516,520,"So tell me, how do you peel?"
3556,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,520,so why do you think the others in the bunch don't appreciate your sense of humor?
3556,1,5,29,35,1.2,0.07991592220483187,520,Really? You named your daughter Emma?
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,"Someone steped on me but it was a ""Freudian Slip""."
3556,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,520,Let's unpeel that.
3556,1,5,29,35,1.2,0.07991592220483187,520,No . . . I don’t think it was a Freudian slip.
3556,1,4,25,30,1.2,0.08840866447369841,520,Do you think you'd be less depressed if you could learn to enjoy physical comedy?
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,This only works if you start the conversation.
3556,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,520,Well you are society's garbage. Get over it!
3556,2,0,18,20,1.2,0.13764944032233706,520,"By now, don't you think the fruit-vs-vegetable conflict is perhaps a moot point?"
3556,1,3,21,25,1.2,0.1,520,"More importantly, do YOU think you have appeal?"
3556,0,4,16,20,1.2,0.0917662935482247,520,"You feel in your heart your a watermelon, is that it?"
3556,0,5,20,25,1.2,0.08164965809277261,520,It's what's on the inside that counts.

3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,Keep it in your peel! I'm not that kind of therapist.
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"I'd go to a 12-step meeting, but everyone blames me for slipping."
3682,2,0,19,21,1.1904761904761905,0.13127665478181164,520,My dissertation was on Freudian slips.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,There's just something inside I feel is missing.
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,Of course you've been sterotyped. But that's not the real you.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"So they said ""Ba NA na na NA na"" and just TOOK it?!?"
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,I always feel this caption contest is rigged against me.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,I've been feeling kinda empty.
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"I don't know what to raise first, that you're completely bananas or the Freudian slip."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,And why do you think people are saying you're going bananas?
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"So, I guess making people slip was a way to get positive attention."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"The Fosters, The Cream Pies, the Splits...all signs of a masochist."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,I thought this was ripe crisis counseling.
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"Just remember as we peel back your childhood, things can get slippery."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,Peelings? I thought you were here to work on your feelings!
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,I find that patients who don't make a Freudian slip feel they're not getting their money's worth.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"I'm in touch with my peelings, uh, I mean feelings! Huh, almost slipped on that one!"
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,So why do you think Jane Goodall ruined your family life?
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,Where do you think this emptiness inside originates?
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"Let's not compare apples to oranges, ok?"
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"No, I'm not wearing a Freudian slip."
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,Surely you have something left to give.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"So, tell me about this vegetable you were so attached to."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,I'm guessing she slipped away as well.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,The feelings of losing your inner self are compensated by your appeal.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"You need to accept that they're laughing with you, not at you."
3682,2,0,19,21,1.1904761904761905,0.13127665478181164,520,I used to be a terrifying octopus - now look at me!
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"Again, let's discuss why your wife thinks you're yellow, slippery, and can't be trusted."""
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,I keep thinking I'm a potato.
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,And...how long have you had this empty feeling inside?
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"Sometimes, people may not find you appealing."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"Hmm, I guess that was a banana in his pocket."
3682,2,0,19,21,1.1904761904761905,0.13127665478181164,520,But the situation with Inky and Blotchy was completely different.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,Now un-peal your emotions for me.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,You have to quit blaming yourself. The accident wasn't your fault.
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"Sure, you miss the old bunch. But you'll always have 69 cents a pound."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"True progress, Chiquita. You're starting to peel away the layers."
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,"As Freud said, sometimes a slip is just a slip."
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,I just don't feel like I'm funny anymore.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"We call that a Freudian Slip, Mike."
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,That reminds me- I also need to pick up nuts and maraschino cherries.
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,Some people say they have one foot on you like it's a bad thing?
3682,0,4,17,21,1.1904761904761905,0.0878051853075513,520,So you think you lost your self confidence after being replaced by a zucchini?
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,"I understand you feel guilty, but it is not your fault."
3682,1,2,18,21,1.1904761904761905,0.11167656571008165,520,You weren't consciously uncoupled. You split.
3780,1,5,31,37,1.1891891891891893,0.07591125921780505,520,"Sorry, I don't date my patients."
3780,3,1,33,37,1.1891891891891893,0.09362436797669607,520,"He used to call me ""appealing"". Now, it's ""appalling""."
3780,0,7,30,37,1.1891891891891893,0.06527647182968217,520,It's not your fault he had one foot in the grave.
3780,1,5,31,37,1.1891891891891893,0.07591125921780505,520,And you say the witch doctor became angry ?
3780,0,7,30,37,1.1891891891891893,0.06527647182968217,520,"That, Mr. Cavendish, is what we psychoanalysts refer to as a Freudian slip."
3785,1,4,27,32,1.1875,0.08324928557283298,520,I think you took my suggestion to try to be more appealing a little too literally.
3785,1,4,27,32,1.1875,0.08324928557283298,520,"So tell me, when did you start feeling so empty inside."
3785,1,4,27,32,1.1875,0.08324928557283298,520,Let us talk about that Freudian slip.
3785,0,6,26,32,1.1875,0.07010217197868432,520,Why would you think you don't have a peel?
3785,0,3,13,16,1.1875,0.10077822185373188,520,We need to peel back the layers to find the underlying problem.
3785,0,6,26,32,1.1875,0.07010217197868432,520,so how do YOU feel about being stepped on all the time?
3785,0,6,26,32,1.1875,0.07010217197868432,520,I just feel like I'm a big joke.
3792,0,5,22,27,1.1851851851851851,0.07618086585254098,520,Peeling away that ego is a good first step.
3792,0,5,22,27,1.1851851851851851,0.07618086585254098,520,So what makes you say that you've been feeling empty lately?
3792,0,5,22,27,1.1851851851851851,0.07618086585254098,520,Doc...I'm just not peeling very well lately
3792,0,5,22,27,1.1851851851851851,0.07618086585254098,520,"So, you say that you find yourself slipping into depression?"
3792,0,5,22,27,1.1851851851851851,0.07618086585254098,520,"But, is there really a ""right"" end to peel from?"
3792,0,5,22,27,1.1851851851851851,0.07618086585254098,520,I feel like a shell of my former self.
3792,1,3,23,27,1.1851851851851851,0.09301896135221943,520,I just can;t deal with the guilt anymore.
3792,1,3,23,27,1.1851851851851851,0.09301896135221943,520,So how long do you think your friends have been finding you unappealing?
3792,1,3,23,27,1.1851851851851851,0.09301896135221943,520,.... regardless - I don't date patients.
3801,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,520,She's not the only one 'fleck'd with brown and a golden hue.'
3801,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,520,"Let's call it ""a banana slip"""
3801,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,520,"Feelings of inadequacy? Yes, and I just don't think I have appeal"
3801,2,3,33,38,1.1842105263157894,0.0831053005440275,520,"So, are you single?"
3801,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,520,Finally! Your split personality is fully revealed!
3801,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,520,We all feel divided some times....
3801,0,7,31,38,1.1842105263157894,0.06373021861834363,520,"And I told her, 'You know, sometimes a banana is just a banana.'"
3801,1,5,32,38,1.1842105263157894,0.07405414149004433,520,So then he just split?
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,Let me get this straight. You are stressed over a slip and fall because you think it is your fault?
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,We may have some trouble finding the root of your problem.
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,You seem split.
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,Let's discuss last week's Freudian slip.
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,At least we've taken care of your castration anxiety.
3809,2,0,20,22,1.1818181818181819,0.1254664653349735,520,"No, of course you still can be useful after retirement. You can still be a prop in slapstick comedy! Your inner peel can shine shoes! There's a lot you can do."
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,And tell me–how did that make you peel?
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,"Because you've been peeled and your innards used for a smoothie, it would be prudent to increase your Prozac dosage significantly for the foreseeable future."
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,Maybe you could start by explaining your appeal.
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,"So, you're saying you're related to the Austrian Peels that gave Freud the slip?"
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,Let's start by pealing back the years.
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,"When it comes to answering my questions, you are a slippery one!"
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,You are afraid my of monkeys and have penis envy?
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,If only I'd been born a toupee.
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,You do realize that Freud hated bananas.
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,That ‘empty feeling’ often indicates a potassium deficiency.
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,"""You should feel much better about yourself, you have great appeal""."
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,"Hmm...identity issues ? Before we begin, are you Dole or Chiquita ? You all look the same without the sticker."
3809,0,6,27,33,1.1818181818181819,0.06818181818181816,520,"Well, this has been a fruitful session"
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,Everyone tries to walk all over me
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,So you and your wife split....
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,I had a dream last night that I slipped on Freud.
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,And you say you made a Freudian slip?
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,Divorce? More like they got...split.
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,"Well, you've certainly got appeal."
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,"They call me heartless—but sometimes I just want a good trip, you know?"
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,"If you want to be known for your wit, you have to stay off the sidewalks."
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,You have to acknowledge why you feel so hollow inside
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,Nothing seems to be appealing anymore.
3809,2,0,20,22,1.1818181818181819,0.1254664653349735,520,What makes you think that you are not appealing?
3809,1,2,19,22,1.1818181818181819,0.10683084570781876,520,What do -you- think you're a symbol of?
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,"Are you familiar with the term ""Freudian slip""?"
3809,0,4,18,22,1.1818181818181819,0.08416546361568651,520,Are you bannanas!?! I'm married!

4057,2,2,30,34,1.1764705882352942,0.08926904831050918,520,Why do you feel people look at you differently?
4057,1,1,15,17,1.1764705882352942,0.12820291010413745,520,I don't know whether to laugh or cry!
4062,1,5,34,40,1.175,0.07059726877843334,520,"And when she said, ""Sometimes a banana is just a good smoothie,"" how did that make you feel?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Split personality? Self-diagnosis is not usually a good idea.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,It seems like a bad case of split personalities.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Stop staring at my legs, you filthy banananimal."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Monkey see, monkey do, banana go to therapy."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"So, why do you think that you don't have appeal?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Your separation anxiety seems to be tripping up everyone you meet.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Everyone slips up now and then.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"What do you think it means, this slippery slope you keep dreaming of..."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I just don't understand why I keep slipping everyone up.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I'm hearing that those you love are all slipping away from you.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,Talk some more about your feelings of people slipping away from you.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Give it to me straight doc, do you think I'm bananas?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,You clearly have a case of banana split personality.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I keep dreaming that you need a big hit of potassium.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,It's not your fault the guy slipped.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"""Tell me more about this 'slippery slope'""."
4063,2,0,21,23,1.173913043478261,0.12014770081874042,520,You're more than a cheap laugh. You're a slightly below average protective shell
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"So, you're here to resolve your anxiety about ""one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel""?"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I can't begin to help you if you won't talk.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Stop blaming yourself. You didn't mean for that man to slip.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I keep waiting for a Freudian slip from you.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,You've really gone bananas this time
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"How do you feel when they call you, ""slippery""?"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I seem to be losing my appeal.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Perhaps she only wanted you to think that her vulnerabilities were in the palm of your hand, Mr. Kong. Mr. Kong?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I think you may have experienced a sizable loss during the phallic stage...
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"So tell me again, you slipped on what?"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,Sometimes Freud is just Freud.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"So tell me, what makes you think you have split personality disorder?"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"I'm sorry but my lawyer said not to let anything slip."""
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"It wasn't really Freudian, he just slipped on me and fell."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Don't internalize blame -- it is his own fault he slipped on you. On behalf of: Howard F. Taylor, Princeton, N. J."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,How long ago did you notice that you went bananas?
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Seems to me like that was a Freudian split.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,Tell me more about these feeling of abandonment. Where do you feel it in your body?
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,How long have you been a Banana Republican?
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Have I been reading too much Freud, or are you just glad to see me?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Can you tell me more about your appeal?
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,It's been a slippery slope. They keep falling head over heels for me.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"One little slip, and now my life is ruined!"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Say more about what is making you feel so unappealing.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,You need to stop suppressing your desire to stand out from the bunch.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"You realize, of course, I can never do that again."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Your mother sounds like a real bitch.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"That's very interesting, tell me how that makes you peel."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I don't think an antidepressant is really going to fix your problem.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Number one, I need to get back to my professional code Number two, I think my boyfriend's on to us."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,You miss breeding fruit flies.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I am not appealing. You are!
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,What's the deal banana peel?
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,You're the second banana split personality I've seen today.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,Sounds like it was more than a Fruedian slip.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,You have stem envy.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Stop pouting, Cheeta, and come back to the couch. We have ten minutes left."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Now, let's tak about your split"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Normally I like to explore your inner child, but in your case I can see that will be a problem."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"And how does that make you peel... I mean, feel?"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I've got a thick skin but nothing left inside. That is the price of leadership!
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I'm not trying to hurt anyone; I just want to be noticed.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,Your castration anxiety may have been justified after all.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"So he slipped, but you were bruised?"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"More than has been the case with my other patients, a Freudian slip from you is understandable."
4063,2,0,21,23,1.173913043478261,0.12014770081874042,520,You have got to stop blaming yourself for your wife's death.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Let me see whether I understand you. You think that peeling back your emotions will produce a slippery slope?
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,It sounds like a bunch of Freudian slips
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Oh my, are you sure you're not really a plantain?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"So, you decided to peel away from the bunch and accept blame for the slips of others."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Do others find you appealing?
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Following the split-up, it's important for you not to slip into a bad place."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"'Torn apart...empty...discarded', let's explore what might lie behind that self-image."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Mr. Dole? What happened? Did you take the blue pill an hour before your date with Chiquita like we discussed?
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"That's quite a litany of complaints: you feel cast aside, you smell rotten, you're yellow, and you feel responsible for people slipping and falling. I think you may suffer from situational anxiety."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"So, why are you feeling do empty?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"So, talk about slapstick."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"So, she told you to split?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"No, I am not going to do that with my legs."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I think you'd be better off just admitting you're slippery
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I don't know why I feel this way; I just feel all used up.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Therapist: ""Split up!"" Patient: ""But I love my apple!"""
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I think the issues with your mother stem from an oedipotassium complex.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Mr. Petersen, you're not bananas, you just think you are."
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,The bunch is lonely too.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Tell me more about your mother.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"So you were in a bunch with the other bananas, a monkey came along, then what happened?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,It's not funny when they fall on you!
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Now tell me- how did that make you peel?
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Reassignment surgery is very difficult.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Well now, that was an interesting slip."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I'm just trying to stay relevant.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Oh no, the man with the yellow hat did it again!"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,Let's set some ground rules right now -I will not tolerate slippery behavior.
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,Tell me; why do you feel discarded?
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,You might be interested to know that my other clients who are living with banana-split-personality disorder tend to self-medicate--with toppings and the like.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Maybe you slip away from people too much
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,You are a danger to others.
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,Why do you say you feel worthless?
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,So it sounds as if you're starting to have second thoughts about the gender surgery?
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"Yes, but the people who fall and hit their heads don't really care if the slip is Freudian or not."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Tell me, Charles, how does that make you peel?"
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,"Being ""organic"" is causing problems at work?"
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,"We've all slipped up, the key is to stop enabling others to slip up as well."
4063,1,2,20,23,1.173913043478261,0.10238603831611556,520,I just feel like no matter what I do I'm always letting things slip
4063,0,4,19,23,1.173913043478261,0.08081046758996392,520,I'm guessing you won't fall for the Freudian slip gag.

4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,I'm really not comfortable with you sitting there judging me for how I use your better half.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"You are not only slippery, but truly evil, and should consider a career in politics ASAP!"
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"Don't be so hard on yourself, you're all appeal."
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,People may toss you away but always remember it's what's inside that counts.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"Why shouldn't they step on me? Obviously, something's missing."
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"Miss Peel, how long have you been under the impression that you are a ballerina?"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,...and then she just split on me.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,Let's peel back another layer and really dig into the meat of your issues.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,And how long have you been having these kinds of thoughts about sidewalks?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Wanna' slip on something more appealing?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,I've just never found psychotherapy very appealing.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"Despite the anti-immigrant sentiment in the country, you must come to grips with the fact that your mother was a plantain."
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,She said I lacked a certain appeal.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Let's go back to the mustachioed man and the day of the crash.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Thanks for clearing my cramps...now what can I help you with.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"It may all seem fruitless now, but be careful not to slide down that slippery slope."
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,You feel I slipped when peeling back your layers?
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,Why do you feel like you're at the bottom of every joke?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"Yes, other fruit. ANY other fruit. Do you think I'm crazy?"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,How did you slip back in here?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,When did you start experiencing this feeling of emptiness?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"It matters not what I think you are. Do you identify as a banana peel without the elongated edible fruit, or a lily blossom with a short stem?"
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,He said he didn't find me appealing anymore
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"Now, on those occasions when you were being punished -- placed in the refrigerator--was the refrigerator light on, or were you in total darkness?"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"I mean, who's to say I'm not an apple?"
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,We're not likely to make any real progress if this is the way you are going to respond
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Everything with you is subconscious.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,Please stop with the 'Freudian slip' excuse - you're consciously being offensive.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,I feel deserted.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"I don't know Doc, I literally feel split on the issue..."
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,I'm having an existential crisis.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"So, you feel like your life is slipping away from you?"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"I'm very accident-prone. What does that mean, doctor?"
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"Your wife, Orange Peel, says you won't help with the kids."
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"First off, you've got to stop blaming yourself."
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,What evidence do you have that you're no longer appealing?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"So, what do you think your appeal is?"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Do you want to talk about your feeling of being so stepped upon?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Many kids grow up fine in families without social standing or appeal.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Don't even think of coming at me with your sex appeal
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"But he's a watermelon rind, Ms. Chiquita . You didn't think there'd be issues?"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Your inner self was soft and fragrant. Tell me more about your exterior. Is it...slippery?
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,In your case a paranoid fear of body snatchers may not be unreasonable.

4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,I'm not clear on your reference to a Freudian slip.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,I aspired to be Bananas Foster but ended up in somebody's smoothie.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,No one would be falling all over you if you weren't so slippery.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,I just have this feeling of emptiness
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,I never thought we would split.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"Yes, I do understand that that slip wasn't consciously intended."
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,So you're saying you have regrets about having a relationship with someone less evolved.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,You call that a Freudian slip ?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"Yes, Yes, I am sure you were once quite the specimen but lets explore those feelings of inadequacy."
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,I know you're upset but it's not your fault he slipped.
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,...and THEN they put me in the refrigerator!
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,Fermenting is a dead-end
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"I thought you said you were ""appeallng,"" not ""a-peeling""."
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,I'm just a shell of my former self.

4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"I actually specialize in marriage splits, not banana splits."

4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Tell me about your bunch of origin.
4425,0,4,24,28,1.1428571428571428,0.0673435029701474,520,"So, when did you start to think people were laughing at you?"
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"Yes now that you have opened up I understand the appeal that separates you from the bunch, but I can't slip from my professional oath."
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,Do you think everyone finds you appealing?

4425,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,520,I'm sure someone out there will find you aPEELing...
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,"Even though your inner core is missing, you still have appeal."
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,It's like every man I attract turns out to be a total monkey.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,""" Then she said 'I would be just as appealing .'"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,It's not always your fault.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,And that's why we split.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Why do you think your feelings are so easily bruised

4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,And how long have you been having this recurring nightmare of the clumsy man in a porkpie hat?

4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,So you've lost your banana. You're still appealing.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Yet you still feel devoid of appeal?
4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,How many lawyers did you say you are working with?
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,"So she says, ""No, I don't like you. You're thin-skinned and slippery."" Frankly, Doc, I was hurt. You find me appealing, don't you, Doc?"
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,Tell me why you think you lost your appeal.
4425,0,3,18,21,1.1428571428571428,0.07824607964359519,520,. . . and you think I'm appealing?

4425,1,1,19,21,1.1428571428571428,0.10432810619146024,520,You *have* to get over these feelings of inferiority.

4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,So believe you have a thin skin.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,You've peeled back the layers but you continue to slip.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,When did you first noticed you were being stalked by monkeys?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I knew you found me a-peeling
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Have you been feeling emty on the inside lately?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Why so miffed? All I said was 'Sometimes a banana is just a banana.'
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,You have survivor’s guilt.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"Slippin', sliden' away--is that your mantra?"
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"Every time the psychiatrists' convention is in town, I make a Freudian slip."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,What happens when people do walk all over you?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"I didn't say your were bananas, I meant you must be bananas"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"I've tried Viagra and Cialis, nothing works. She slipped out of our apartment."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"So, every time someone picks you, you feel the need to split?"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"Of course you have separation issues, you're a bloody banana."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,You seem to be perking up a bit.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"I told you I don't go out with my patients, not even for ""just a cup of coffee."" It's a slippery slope."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Did our foreplay make up for eating you?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,And when did you two split?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,And why did that appeal to you?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"You may think I have great legs, but you have no appeal for me."
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,I'm sensing an unusual amount of friction from you today.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Tell me how you feel about being peeled from the wrong end?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"So, you're making an appeal to lessen the number of New Yorker psychiatrist cartoons?"
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,So you only feel like half an octopus.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"I can't help it, I am naturally attracted to people with one foot in the grave."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"So, they laughed at you when he slipped on you?"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"I mean, I know I'm appealing and she tells me she she loves me for what's inside. So why do I feel so empty?"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,It hurts on the inside.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,So it sounds like what you're trying to say is that you don't want to let this relationship slip away like the last few did.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"I get the slips and falls, but you can't blame yourself for rise of ISIS."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE LOST YOUR APPEAL. I THINK YOU HAVE SIMPLY GONE BANANAS.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"Now you are upset, because I couldn't resist eating you."
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"Maybe if you were less slimy, people wouldn't step on you so much."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,He said I'm no longer appealing.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Tell me again why you find a peel appalling.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,So you feel others don't find you appealing?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Feelings are like onions.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,It's not your fault you were the banana peel his one foot was on.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,You have a slippery appeal.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"So tell me, how long have you felt that you're not a peeling?"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"So, you feel guilty about the part you played in the Freudian slip?"
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,You say you're losing appeal?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Try to think of yourself as a peeling.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Get over it. Your life is one big joke.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Although I was born a squid I always felt I wanted to live my life as a calamari.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,When did you start feeling guilty about collecting a share of the money in these fake slip and fall cases?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I always said he was a slippery character!
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,you are! appealing and well adjusted; we'll have to deal with the fruit or vegetable thing next time.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"I'm telling you, I've gone bananas!"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,We can't move on until you can come to terms with your slippery side.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Why do you think I find you appalling? You are actually appealing.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,And which Freudian did you make slip?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,You really feel you lack appeal???
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I only booed once and then I was smashed into a cleshay.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,So what you seem to be saying is you have never been the same since your parents split.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Now we need closure.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,When did you first feel this desire to take people down
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,So tell me when it all started to fall apart.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I think you feel you have no core inside.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,That was a Freudian split.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Have you considered approaching Cialis Mr. Dole?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"You say you're thick-skinned, but people have seen through your façade and have taken advantage of you."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"No, I will not slip on you !"
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Please tell me more about that dream. So you were a stepping stone and then...?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Tell me about the clowns.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,And when did your sex peel begin to slip?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Tell me why you feel like a punchline.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"Is there rigid banana flesh under your peel, or are you just happy to see me?"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I'm peeling very depressed. My girlfriend wanted to split.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Your issues are certainly appealing.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Damn genie said I'd be TOP BANANA!
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"Honestly, I don't know why I split !"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,A textbook case of stamen envy if I ever saw one.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"No one ever finds me appeeling enough. It's always orange, orange, orange."
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,It's quite normal that sometimes you're just a banana.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,You need not doubt yourself. Of courseyou have appeal.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,So when did you start feeling like a mere shell of your former self?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,How long have you and your ex been split up?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,It was a Freudian slip.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Sorry. Mellow Yellow has been debunked.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,About how long ago did you and your wife split?
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,I feel like my life is slipping away.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"So, you enjoy making slip-ups?"
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"Well, my mother started hanging with a pretty ripe bunch, that's when my Dad split."
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Being the second banana is okay. As long as you're not the third.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,I think you need to stop that diet.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"""And to think, after all of these years, it was me who was slipping""."
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Did you say 'pear or pair'?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I think you should get in touch with your inner self.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I don't think you're crazy.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,What makes you think you've lost your appeal?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,My life has been characterized by a long slippery slope.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,"And why exactly do you feel no one finds you ""a-peel-ing""?"
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,That's what we call in the profession a Freudian slip.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"Excuse me, sir, but your session is not quite finished. Are you trying to give me the ""slip?"""
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,So -- deep feelings of emptiness followed by bouts of hysteria?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,And I really resent when she accuses me of slipping up.
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,He gave me the Freudian slip!
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,The first peel is the deepest.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,This is progress. You've learned how to express your peelings.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,"So, explain why you feel unfulfilled with your life?"
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,Was that a Freudian slip just now?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Be easy on yourself. You're not the cause of people's Freudian slips.
4723,1,1,20,22,1.1363636363636365,0.09968466614432427,520,And how did that make you feel when the banana deserted you for three scoops of ice cream and a maraschino cherry?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,Whenever I get close to someone they split
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,So what happens after you slip into this other realm?
4723,0,3,19,22,1.1363636363636365,0.0748867700952649,520,I have an obsession that I will cause an accident

5290,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,520,Let's talk about your obsession with Freudian slip and falls.
5290,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,520,We already tried light therapy.
5290,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,520,"And, you say since the penectomy, you've been feeling empty inside?"

5290,1,3,46,50,1.1,0.05150787536377128,520,"Help me, Doctor! I just hate making people slip and fall but I always have such a strong inner compulsion to do it!"
5290,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,520,"I don’t know what it means, but I keep having this dream of people stepping on me and slipping."
5290,0,2,18,20,1.1,0.06882472016116854,520,"Your family was a bad bunch, but you're appealing."
