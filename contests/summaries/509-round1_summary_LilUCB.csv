3389,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,Recalculating route...recalculating route...
44,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,But they said I didn't have to swim faster than the bear; I only had to swim faster than you!
387,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,And I left Flint for this?
6743,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,Am I really that predictable?
2469,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,This is exactly why I said we shouldn't have kids.
6884,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,I don't have to swim faster than the bear. I just have to swim faster than you.
16,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,"I swear, you and your 'live streaming' will be the death of me."
3436,88,3,0,8,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2816715160878121,509,Full disclosure: we're from Flint.
1117,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,We swam upstream for this?
1156,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,"'Let's swim upstream to the spawning grounds,' she said. 'It'll be romantic,' she said."
1933,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,Did you ever try the tilapia?
1916,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,This is the last time I follow my instincts.
438,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,"You don't want us, we're genetically modified."
4687,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,"I misunderstood when you said, 'Bear left!'"
1011,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,Don't believe all you hear about the benefits of eating salmon.
2207,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,Oh... BEAR to the left.
1769,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,Whose idea was it to swim upstream?
3785,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,You're really putting a damper on my sex life...
7087,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,My name is Trevor and I'll be your entrée tonight.
4735,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,Sometimes the sex just isn't worth it.
7081,88,0,6,5,11,1.5454545454545454,0.15745916432444337,509,See? This is what happens when you go against the current.
6510,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,"Back off pal, we're endangered."
592,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,Do you mind? I'm trying to spawn.
6423,88,2,2,7,11,1.5454545454545454,0.24729946379518986,509,Forget the suburbs--this commute is killing me.
7354,88,1,4,6,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2073046227452978,509,That's what I get for not going mainstream
4703,88,3,0,8,11,1.5454545454545454,0.2816715160878121,509,"For this, we swam 1,000 miles?"
556,139,1,5,7,13,1.5384615384615385,0.18311354944981667,509,"Just so you know, I had worms for lunch."
5580,139,1,5,7,13,1.5384615384615385,0.18311354944981667,509,But if I teach you to fish you'll eat for a lifetime
496,139,1,5,7,13,1.5384615384615385,0.18311354944981667,509,"You wouldn't eat a talking fish, would you?"
2079,139,1,5,7,13,1.5384615384615385,0.18311354944981667,509,"Oh, so that's what he meant by bear left."
3577,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,That's the last time I take directions from a saltwater fish!
1884,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,The fat ones are behind us.
7102,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,"Actually, Sven, the only one I have to outswim is *you*."
4063,143,2,2,8,12,1.5,0.23028309323591914,509,"At the fork, we should have taken the river less traveled."
4151,143,0,5,5,10,1.5,0.16666666666666666,509,"Roe, roe, roe your b. . . uh oh!"
3861,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,Life was easier back on the farm
6034,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,"I'm too big , he's too small but the next fish will be juuuuuuust right!"
4252,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm loaded with bones.
1886,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Maybe we should adopt.
3511,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,"Ok, now I get it. BEAR LEFT, at the next falls."
1974,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,And I thought getting up here was the hard part.
2188,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,You're shoes are untied.
1917,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"On second thought, maybe we should have stayed in school."
463,143,2,2,8,12,1.5,0.23028309323591914,509,I hate this commute.
4050,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,The tastier salmon are behind us.
6793,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,I can do this all day.
7331,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,We shouldn't have taken the scenic route.
2087,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Larry, remind me why we do this every year?"
1893,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,So do you still think the journey is more important than the destination?
1747,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,I believe we're up the creek without a paddle!
1948,143,0,5,5,10,1.5,0.16666666666666666,509,"Quick, act genetically modified!"
6916,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,Looks like we really are in a bear market
7313,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,"The things we'll do for sex, eh, Ned?"
6519,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Let's just adopt.
727,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Bear left. BEAR LEFT!!
6352,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I will never trust Google Maps again.
1709,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm suddenly not in the mood anymore.
561,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,I don't suppose you'd let me go with a warning?
2040,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"I said, bear left!"
7171,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Someone must have tipped him off that we would be coming
6575,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,How about giving me up for Lent?
6313,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,I don't need to swim faster than the bear--I just need to swim slower than you!
3148,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,I told you we should have taken the ferry.
7003,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Are we almost there yet?
6303,143,1,2,5,8,1.5,0.2672612419124244,509,Omega-3 fatty acids are highly overrated.
3933,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,"'Skip the fish ladder and take the waterfall,' she says; 'it'll be good for your heart,' she says."
1697,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,Try to look bigger than you really are.
3128,143,0,6,6,12,1.5,0.15075567228888181,509,Who's taking this one for the team??
1814,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Have you seen my wife?
672,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"I wouldn't if I were you, we're from Flint!"
3707,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,Perhaps one of these days we should consider taking the river less traveled.
6243,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,"I'll grant you, life on the fish farm did have its advantages."
5238,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Of course I'm genetically modified! I'm talking to you, aren't I?"
6620,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,You might want to go back. The cast of Revenant is upriver.
684,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,By law I need to warn you that I'm genetically modified.
509,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,You look nothing like your profile picture
1655,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,"On second thought, spawning's overrated."
6485,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Now this is live streaming.
4012,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Oh, that's what they meant by 'at the waterfall, bear left'!"
6706,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Yeah. Great shortcut, Floyd."
7230,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Your eyelids are getting heavy. You are very sleepy. You are a vegetarian.
721,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,Shouldn't you be somewhere else preventing forest fires?
6708,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,It's almost as if he was expecting us.
3661,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"'Just a myth, just a myth.' That's the last time I listen to you."
1587,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I think it's time we looked into a better streaming service.
5981,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Can't we all just get along?
4547,143,0,5,5,10,1.5,0.16666666666666666,509,It's time to turn around and just go with the flow.
1436,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,"Fake left, On THREE."
140,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I knew I should have stayed on the farm!
5771,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm part of the assisted suicide program.
4948,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I think their definition of sustainable is different than ours.
58,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,This is no way for one endangered species to treat another.
5399,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Carp! Just a couple of Carp!
1045,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,So this is how it ends.
2763,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Of all the streams in all the world....
7763,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Let's ask someone else for directions.
5796,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Better pass me by, Mr. Bear. I'm just getting back from a year in the Flint River."
5069,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"C'mon, man. I'm on a date here!"
4460,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,The benefits of salmon oil have been shown to be overrated.
158,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm from Flint.
1475,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,The GPS did say bear left at the falls
1412,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Honey, you wanted the exciting, romantic get-away."
7794,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,I'm farmed he's wild.
1022,143,0,5,5,10,1.5,0.16666666666666666,509,As if swimming against the current wasn't hard enough.
5473,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Great, as if swimming up stream wasn't hard enough!"
90,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Aren't you supposed to be hibernating?
5517,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,Maybe going home is not such a big deal.
2335,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,Now you know what's eating me.
4754,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Step aside fish breath, we're coming through."
7666,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,I'd reconsider. I'm from Flint.
5589,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Can't we discuss this as one endangered species to another?
7368,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"I don't have to swim faster than the bear, I only have to swim faster than you."
5595,143,2,1,7,10,1.5,0.26874192494328497,509,Think for a second...You're endangered. We're full of mercury. Why risk it?
1319,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Sam, back away slowly. Have you seen what this guy did to DiCaprio?"
2679,143,0,5,5,10,1.5,0.16666666666666666,509,"Okay, I'm distracting him. Now what?"
4834,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"There are other fish in the sea, you know."
914,143,2,2,8,12,1.5,0.23028309323591914,509,...Heads UP...we got a Smokey ahead!!!
4913,143,0,6,6,12,1.5,0.15075567228888181,509,You can't always trust your instincts!
2293,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,Alternatives? Honey pots and picnic baskets to name a few.
7699,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,It's never good to be early to these things.
66,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Move your fat butt, I mean, excuse me sir."
2483,143,1,3,6,10,1.5,0.22360679774997896,509,"Look over there, it's a hiker with a picnic basket"
2772,143,2,2,8,12,1.5,0.23028309323591914,509,"Keep moving, they don't like fast food!"
191,143,1,4,7,12,1.5,0.19462473604038075,509,Well...this is awkward.

6791,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,Seen any females come up this way?
6106,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,I don't have to swim faster than the bear - I just have to swim slower than you.
3561,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,So much for the Bear Falls short cut.
1804,419,0,4,6,10,1.4,0.16329931618554516,509,"Sorry, we're not in season."
5289,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,Dude. You're totally spawn-blocking me right now
6805,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,I'm a little gamey. He marinates in dill and moisturizes with butter.
6211,419,0,4,6,10,1.4,0.16329931618554516,509,I should have taken the stairs.

5842,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,"You're endangered, I'm endangered. Let's just leave it at that."

2804,419,0,4,6,10,1.4,0.16329931618554516,509,So it's true: You can't go home again.
2259,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,"Seriously, I an farm bred, GMO and completely indigestible!"
2165,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,"'You're into catch-and-release, right'?"
2111,419,0,4,6,10,1.4,0.16329931618554516,509,"It never fails. Every time you switch lanes, it gets worse."
83,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,How do you feel about catch-and-release?
3467,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,This is why I drink.
2739,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,"The slower, fatter, salmon are just behind us."
3305,419,2,0,8,10,1.4,0.26666666666666666,509,I'm farm raised.
430,419,0,4,6,10,1.4,0.16329931618554516,509,Don't just stand there. Go prevent a forest fire.
3283,419,1,2,7,10,1.4,0.22110831935702663,509,"Every year, the same goddamn ending."

5470,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"No, you couldn't stay home and have a nice quiet romantic evening-you had to see the wild side upstream, didn't you?"
3068,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Here's a thought. Let's just spawn downstream this year.
5495,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Meh, spawning isn't all it's cracked up to be. Go on without me."
3028,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,We welcome migrants here.
5488,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Yes, I know we're a cliche, but we're an iconic cliche."
3063,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Have you tried the chicken here? It's great.
5474,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,You really need to start fishing responsibly !
4008,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Just play dead
4883,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Simon says, 'Take three steps forward.'"

4006,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"OK Alice, just aim for that big brown rock"
2343,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,We'll take a quick vote and toss someone up in a minute.
72,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,As if this isn't hard enough!
2585,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I'll need to see a license.
6829,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Omega-3 fatty acids are overrated.
3026,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,You think he cares that we are endangered?
2142,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Perhaps we should have gotten a room.
756,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Please sir, we're the only two left"

746,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Can we negotiate?
4794,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Looks like we're about to meet a grizzly end.
2183,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Please, I don't want to die a virgin."
2983,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"At this moment, the fish realized it wasn't worth it."
740,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"You know, maybe I don't need to spawn after all."
5516,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Believe me, the omega-3 found in seafood is wildly overrated."
2336,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"I don't know, Henry. He looks like a credible threat to me."
2991,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,This just seems like a metaphor for my life.
6069,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Pardon me.
232,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,One false move and you'll find out why they call us sockeyes!
983,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,'Recalculating....'.
2171,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Your breath smells like Doug.
724,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Don't believe all that Omega 3 healthy diet nonsense!
3025,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Would it change things if I told you we were genetically modified?
4816,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I hate this new immigration policy
5465,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Hey, your shoe is untied!"
6246,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Fresh water fish should not be eaten raw.
3980,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Can't you read, the sign says 'No Fishing'"
2556,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,This is going to be grizzly! I hope we can bear it!
4951,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,You didn't tell me the road was under consumption.
3920,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,SIRI! RECALCULATE!
6340,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"You distract him, Leonard, and I'll go for the throat."
6348,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,This is totally killing the mood.
5394,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Look, Fred. They sent someone to welcome us home."
3901,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Wouldn't you rather eat me on a bagel with a shmear?
643,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,If you stay perfectly still he won't see you.
4976,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I told you we shouldn't go back to the same place this year...
3171,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,But it's not Friday!
7151,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"On the count of three, fake right and do a left end around as we practiced."
3175,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"You should know right now, I'm loaded with Mercury."
292,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I hate this capture contest.
7770,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I can never remember whether to play dead or make lots of noise.
5384,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Smile for the Webcam.
1052,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Just remember, it's as afraid of us as we are of it."
622,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Genetically modified!
6309,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Damned if we do, dammed if we don't..."
274,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Damn, I'm still a virgin."
652,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,'Forget celibacy!' you said. 'This trip will be totally worth it!' you said.
4928,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I said we should have just gone back to my place.
2193,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"I'm serious, I could teach you to eat for a lifetime."
5459,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Seriously though, no one follows Paleo anymore."
7190,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Don't just stand there, help me up!"
5453,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Hello, can I talk to you about your relationship with Cod?"
4933,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Hey big guy, you are a real spawn blocker standing there."
3104,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I am up to here in mercury!
3968,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I hate reunions.
7711,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Carp Diem
7188,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,What fresh hell is this?
2564,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Gravity, don't fail me now!"
2356,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Dying is guaranteed, spawning is not!"
662,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"I thought they said, 'Bear left!'"
1687,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"It's okay, we do it in the water too."
3954,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,We summered in Flint. Just think about it.
1025,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Talk about your Murphy's Law!
6296,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Are you the Trump Bear, whose coming was foretold?"
6232,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Actually, I'm 100% soy."
2199,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,If you let us go we can promise you caviar.
4767,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"You want a piece of mercury, my friend?"
2951,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"It's only fair to tell you, I swam all the way from Flint."
4478,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I'm sure there's some sort of metaphor here.
7597,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Just so you know, we're up to our gills with mercury."
5823,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I hope this is a catch and release river
156,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,And they say that God doesn't have a sense of humor.
4455,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Sometimes, your day can suddenly turn into a real bear."
1468,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Nope! He's still there. Nope! He's still there. Nope! he's still there.
848,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"I'm swimming upstream to spawn, you're looking for lunch. So, who has the loftier goal?"
5806,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Damn, I guess it is true. You really can't go home again."
1373,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Play dead, it worked for DiCaprio."
843,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Eat more chicken.
2805,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Honey, do you know who we're supposed to call about problems with our streaming services?"
112,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,You know what's underrated? Going with the flow.
2811,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I happen to think you were marvelous in The Revenant.
1478,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Congratulations, you've been naturally selected."
4407,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,What good is lox? It's not like you'll find a good bagel in Montana!
5610,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,My cartoonist friend put me here and I'm not moving an inch!
4669,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I guess it's true. You can't go home again.
5630,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"On second thought, maybe I can live a fulfilled life without children of my own."
2305,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Look into my eyes that's it... keep looking.
5784,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I don't remember this on the way down.
2285,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"'I know we look tasty, but actually we're totally diseased and filled with deadly parasites."
2286,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,But I AM trying to go to my happy place!
7562,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Just remember to put them to bed early and feed the dog, also we left you money on the counter for pizza, oh looks like our ride's here, got to go bye!"
4595,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I think this could interrupt our sex lives
2282,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,You lookin' at me . . . ? Are you lookin' at ME?!
2736,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I told you we shouldn't go swimming on Fridays during Lent!
2290,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I don't need to outswim the bear... I just need to outswim you!
5728,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,You better think it over. We just escaped from a farm.
4541,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Do you really want to accumulate more mercury?
4533,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I think I just spawned.
5744,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,You’ve never had venison?
137,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I think we should adopt.
1395,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,It's no use. I'm Catch-22.
4515,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,We're on a mission.
4508,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Like swimming upstream isn't bad enough?!
870,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,There goes our debut at Le Bernardin.
4496,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Salmon, now streaming live!"
4400,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,These two shall pass.
5605,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"In the woods! Do you hear me? In the woods, NOT in the river."
937,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Oh stuff it, Jerry. No one believes that was you in 'The Revenant.'"
7614,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"Wait for my mother-in-law, she's twice my size!"
4729,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Reservations? Really? That's new.
2654,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Milt, it's now or never!"
2653,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,OK. But just let me spawn first.
2892,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,I must know before dying... Do you guys really do that in the woods?
4737,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Worst GPS Directions Ever.
6830,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Aww man...can I at least lay my eggs first?
5958,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,"I told you, the upstream market is looking bearish."
5960,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,not sure if up stream is a good idea.
4263,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Can I offer you some caviar instead?
4740,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,You gotta get home right-a-way - some blond chick just broke in.
4258,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"So, eat us now--just 2--or let us spawn--and later eat a riverfull..."
5556,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,It turns out it really is the journey; not the destination.
5976,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,You'd think we'd learn by now!
95,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Wait... Did the directions say 'bear right' or 'bear left'?
4223,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,As if swimming upstream wasn't hard enough...
2635,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Unless you're immune to salmonella you better back off.
3866,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Told you we should've gotten off at the last exit!
5941,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I'm flexible. Let's go with the flow.
5540,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Seriously? ‘Come here often?’ is your best pick up line?
7399,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"-If there was no lead in this water, do you really think we would be jumping right at you???"
4726,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Yes it's true, life's a bear and then you die."
2821,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Like its not hard enough swimming upstream...
1509,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,As if spawning wasn't hard enough...
5887,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,There's been a recall.
4344,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,"Hey pal, guess why they call me Sockeye."
1513,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,I knew there was a catch.
7618,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,When you said 'getting up these falls was a bear'...I didn't take you literally!
4710,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Yes it is where salmonella comes from.
7429,446,1,1,6,8,1.375,0.26305214040457564,509,Look! Behind you! Donald Trump!
4325,446,0,3,5,8,1.375,0.18298126367784998,509,Is this what they mean by up a creek without a paddle?

1196,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,I think I just made the endangered species list.
2624,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,I don’t have to out swim the bear. I need to out swim you.
2344,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Sex Ed never said a word about this.
844,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,So much for practicing safe spawning.
7207,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Full disclosure. We're loaded with PCBs.

840,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"Honey, I think we should rethink having kids..."
1682,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"OK, this is it. Remember your moves!"
3102,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,"Not to lay a guilt trip on you, but you'd also be killing the unborn."

2493,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Fifty bucks if you can wait until after we spawn.
5472,1436,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,509,You must have other fish to fry.
6248,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"Well! Don't just stand there, give us a paw."

3223,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,I'm really hoping you're a vegan.
1284,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,You may want to rethink this. You do know you're standing in the Flint River?
4024,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"You're welcome to borrow my fish ladder, guys."
6443,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,I just peed in the water. You're probably gonna want to get out.
4851,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,Perhaps you should go chill a bottle of Pinot Grigio first.'
5355,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,There are plenty more of us in the sea.
3683,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,What are the odds he's a vegetarian?
5776,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"Salmon, party of two."
1441,1436,1,1,10,12,1.25,0.17943514064131835,509,"Why fill up now?,...,DiCaprio is just 50 yards downstream."
2223,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Maybe the ocean wasn't so bad after all.
362,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"Sure...we'll just swim upstream, you said. We'll meet some hot chicks, you said."
5061,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,I guess the cute Chinook we met downstream last Friday night isn't going to be meeting us around the bend after all.
6701,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"Eat him, I'm farm raised"

1876,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"I have no idea! But after 3 years at sea, she looks pretty good to me."
3520,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,As if swimming upstream weren't enough.
3522,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,Sometimes I really hate my instincts.
3531,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"Honey, do we have to have kids?"
7468,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,So that's why my analyst said bears in dreams were symbolic of death.
7465,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Didn't see that coming.
5738,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,"Gatekeepers, nothing but goddamn gatekeepers."
3618,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Full disclosure: we've just relocated from the Flint River.
4572,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,All this aggravation for some external fertilization ?!
2005,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,"Nah, it's just not worth it, I'm not doing this trip any more."
4652,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,The big guy down stream said it's called 'Catch and Release'!
7396,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,As if swimming up stream is not challenging enough
7589,1436,1,0,7,8,1.25,0.25,509,Are you hormone-free?
4492,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Talk about a treacherous commute
226,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,What's DiCaprio like on set?
527,1436,0,3,9,12,1.25,0.13055824196677338,509,"Damn climate change, he should still be hibernating."
916,1436,0,2,6,8,1.25,0.16366341767699427,509,Definitely swiping right on these two.
