511,4,14,58,76,1.2894736842105263,0.06438859404737743,559,I said Walk!

532,7,7,60,74,1.2837837837837838,0.07332043922869991,559,We called him fishmeal.
532,7,7,60,74,1.2837837837837838,0.07332043922869991,559,He's killing it.
532,6,9,59,74,1.2837837837837838,0.07075064354296645,559,That's the jolliest I've ever seen Roger.
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,Great talent! Just not cut out to be a pirate.
532,6,9,59,74,1.2837837837837838,0.07075064354296645,559,We need a stiffer plank.

532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,We should have waited until after the Pirate Olympics to get rid of him.
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,See? What did I tell you? A flawless execution.

532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,Who installed the springboard?
532,3,15,56,74,1.2837837837837838,0.0624095651395455,559,I'm going to miss Jolly Roger.
532,6,9,59,74,1.2837837837837838,0.07075064354296645,559,These things go a lot smoother since we implemented that management consultant's recommendation to rebrand as a contest.
532,5,11,58,74,1.2837837837837838,0.06808392111797266,559,"Arrr, his form is to die for."
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,An execution well-executed.
532,3,15,56,74,1.2837837837837838,0.0624095651395455,559,I don't think he has the right attitude about this!
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,"Without the circus, his life had no meaning."
532,2,17,55,74,1.2837837837837838,0.05936935719680311,559,"Finally, a plank salesman that understands our business"
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,He dived as he lived.
532,3,15,56,74,1.2837837837837838,0.0624095651395455,559,Now I feel guilty.
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,The sharks won't care whether it's a 10 or a 2.
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,His execution is a perfect 10!
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,Forget gold. We'll be lucky if you get bronze.
532,5,11,58,74,1.2837837837837838,0.06808392111797266,559,Looks like a 9.5 to me.
532,3,15,56,74,1.2837837837837838,0.0624095651395455,559,Walking the plank is so yesterday.
532,3,15,56,74,1.2837837837837838,0.0624095651395455,559,Roger is a bit too jolly.
532,6,9,59,74,1.2837837837837838,0.07075064354296645,559,I'm actually going to kind of miss him.
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,"OK, but can he swim?"
532,3,15,56,74,1.2837837837837838,0.0624095651395455,559,That is what happens when you for forget to put on the blindfold
532,4,13,57,74,1.2837837837837838,0.065308399673034,559,Avast! Fish that scallywag out of the water. I want to see that again.
562,7,7,61,75,1.28,0.07243512163893182,559,I don't think he gets the true spirit of walking the plank.
562,6,9,60,75,1.28,0.06990340826087443,559,It's to distract the press while we pillage.
562,4,13,58,75,1.28,0.06454274371116994,559,That's only going to earn Long John the silver.
562,1,19,55,75,1.28,0.0555399377446958,559,"Always makes the best of any situation, doesn't he?"
562,3,15,57,75,1.28,0.061687968076484787,559,Remember to leave this out of the obituary.
562,3,15,57,75,1.28,0.061687968076484787,559,"Arrrrr! Three sheets to the wind, and still a perfect 10."
562,2,17,56,75,1.28,0.05869450608911404,559,That's not a cannonball.
562,8,5,62,75,1.28,0.07488128743021989,559,"I'd say a ""10"" for style....and execution!"
562,2,17,56,75,1.28,0.05869450608911404,559,Tell the other Red Bull salesman he's up next.
562,5,11,59,75,1.28,0.06727649014422592,559,The cheeky bastard can't even swim!
562,5,11,59,75,1.28,0.06727649014422592,559,"And,for his final dive...."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,"If he did it with a peg leg, then I'd be impressed."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,"You got to admit, he went out in style."
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,He saved the best for last.
573,6,8,58,72,1.2777777777777777,0.0719236636231486,559,"Ah, to be young and full of life again."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,"Don't worry--if the sharks don't finish him off, lack of affordable health care will."
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,Should've keelhauled him.
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,What the... Really?
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,Now watch for a splashless entry.
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,". Ten points for style, none for execution."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,"Sublime elevation, extension... I mean, arrgh!"
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,Ya' can't be havin' em walk the plank this close to Miami.
573,6,8,58,72,1.2777777777777777,0.0719236636231486,559,"Arrr, I'm giving the lad a 10.0 for execution."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,Hey! This ain't no Carnival Cruise ship!
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,The kid had style. I'll give him that.
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,He's really going overboard with these dives.
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,There goes the dreaded Black Swan
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,"And that, gentlemen, is the definition of ""panache""!"
573,6,8,58,72,1.2777777777777777,0.0719236636231486,559,And he steals the gold!
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,I've never seen such a flawless execution.
573,6,8,58,72,1.2777777777777777,0.0719236636231486,559,"Perfect approach, excellent take-off, poor decision to dive into Shark Bay."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,That's it.....no more stops at Fire Island....
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,I prefer his cannonball.
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,A show off to the very end.
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,Much better than the entertainment on our last cruise.
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,"I know, but he wasn't a team player."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,They call it assisted suicide.
573,1,18,53,72,1.2777777777777777,0.05671712135968739,559,"Performance arrrt, me matey."
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,That confirms our suspicions.
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,"Now, that's a class act."
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,"He was always going for the gold, matey."
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,I'll bet he can swim.
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,I guess that's what it's like to see the ocean half full.
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,Such talent. What a waste.
573,2,16,54,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06006719705512129,559,I didn't expect Roger to be quite so jolly.
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,Nope - still too much spring.
573,5,10,57,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06915039466443099,559,"It figures that, just when we get rid of him, he shows talent."
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,Looks like he's done this before.
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,This is why I am always saying we should just stab them.
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,I told him to take a flying leap.
573,6,8,58,72,1.2777777777777777,0.0719236636231486,559,"Argh, he's always goin' for the gold, boys!"
573,4,12,56,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06626115585708794,559,Charades just won't be the same with him gone.
573,7,6,59,72,1.2777777777777777,0.07459389851526126,559,I'd like to see him try that with a peg leg.
573,8,4,60,72,1.2777777777777777,0.07717179538169601,559,Still showboating!
573,2,16,54,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06006719705512129,559,Let's rethink the fitness center.
573,3,14,55,72,1.2777777777777777,0.06324005430728247,559,He always wanted to make a big splash.
573,1,18,53,72,1.2777777777777777,0.05671712135968739,559,"Always was a bit of a drama queen, aye??"
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,A diver's life for him.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,I said WALK the plank!
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,Not a bad swan song.
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,"Well his approach was a little rushed. Otherwise, I'd give a 10."
619,2,15,52,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06153776060943875,559,I deduct two points for flamboyance.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,We should have told him we've run aground.
619,6,7,56,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07410752875954478,559,It's blimey awkward capturing French ships.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,"Aye, ye jumped the shark."
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,And I thought he'd stolen that gold medal...
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,Stop him! He's taking the gold!
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,kind of takes the fun out of funeral
619,1,17,51,69,1.2753623188405796,0.057971014492753624,559,"Nice, but without leg irons the degree of difficulty is really low."
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,From now on let's just say walk the plank.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,It's time to start extreme vetting.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,"I said it's time for your swan song, not swan dive, ye scurvy dog!"
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,That guy takes all the fun out of this.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,I knew piracy wasn't his passion.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,I like a man who goes out with style!
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,We're just not getting through to him.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,Nice booty.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,Now we know who's from Penzance.
619,2,15,52,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06153776060943875,559,Me'thinks he's not grasping the concept here.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,"I give him some credit Mateys. When I said jump, he did not even ask how high."
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,"Arr... Perfect execution, for a perfect execution."
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,His private diving lessons cost me an arm and a leg.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,The lying press will call it a swan dive.
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,Let’s get back to lethal injection.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,I'll give that dive a 7 for difficulty and a 10 for execution.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,WOW! I hope he hits the landing.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,What do you think he knows that we don't?
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,The damn fool thought I'd said this was to be his swan dive.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,I don't think he took this seriously.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,SERIOUSLY???
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,I like his attitude.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,He respectfully declined the cabinet position.
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,Keep those toes pointed!
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,"THAT,,,,my friends, is how you walk the plank,,,,,"
619,6,7,56,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07410752875954478,559,Arr…and a 10.0 for execution.
619,2,15,52,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06153776060943875,559,"Blast him, he makes it look like fun."
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,What did I tell ye? The scurvy bilge rat be goin' for the gold!
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,"Aye, you've got to admire his hang-time."
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,"I told him that if he got an 8 or higher, a mermaid would save him."
619,2,15,52,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06153776060943875,559,"Shiver me springboards, it was suppose to be a reverse gainer with a twist ye scurvy dog!"
619,1,17,51,69,1.2753623188405796,0.057971014492753624,559,You just couldn't let me have my moment.
619,2,15,52,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06153776060943875,559,Planking is so last year
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,Can't find good pirates these days...
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,Notice the arch in the back and point in the toes.
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,There goes our best chance at a gold medal.
619,2,15,52,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06153776060943875,559,Talk about going out in style.
619,0,19,50,69,1.2753623188405796,0.05416992765191319,559,He'd better at least come back with silver
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,"Aye, but will he nail the execution?"
619,2,15,52,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06153776060943875,559,"Oh man, I hate it when they do that."
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,And the gold goes to...us.
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,Do you think he knows we hit a sandbar?
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,And the winner is Gravity.
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,Arg... I'll give it a 9.5
619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,You've gotta love a guy who rises to the occasion.
619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,If only we could execute like him.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,Shiver me timbers. His swan song's a swan dive.
619,5,9,55,69,1.2753623188405796,0.07117350883117408,559,9.5! Much better than yesterday.

619,4,11,54,69,1.2753623188405796,0.06811322118234958,559,You know that this is the sudden death round mate.

619,3,13,53,69,1.2753623188405796,0.0649088086497521,559,He has a real spring in his step.

686,3,13,54,70,1.2714285714285714,0.06409564725042376,559,We should have left him in Acapulco.
686,5,9,56,70,1.2714285714285714,0.07025958544104309,559,I give this execution a 10.

689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,And that is exactly why he was never going to make it as a pirate.
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,He's going for the gold.
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,"Look, nothing against the guy, it just wasn't a good fit."
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,"Arr, there be no more shanghaiing what's flying the rainbow colors."
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,That's an 8.7 or I'll eat my parrot.
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,This isn't his first gangplank
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,He burned our pecan chocolate soufflés for the last time!
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,I hate it when they don't take me seriously...
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,"Aye, if he thinks I was hard on him, wait til he sees his score from the Russian judge!"
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,He never was one to make a splash.
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,I'll bet that's why they tie their hands!
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,"If he nails the entry, maybe I'll reconsider."
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,He's taking it well.
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,I told him it was Olympic tryouts.
689,2,14,51,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06230202312960611,559,I was hoping for a cannonball.
689,6,6,55,67,1.2686567164179106,0.07543658411895597,559,Arrg!! So overboard about everything!!
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,"Sure, that's a difficult dive to try, but what's he got to lose."
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,So that's where he got the gold.
689,5,8,54,67,1.2686567164179106,0.07237675171740394,559,That Mankoff fellow could be a real wise guy.
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,Grace under pressure.
689,2,14,51,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06230202312960611,559,I knew it... Pirate assisted suicide.
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,"To make things worse, I think he also has my wallet."
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,I got a doubloon that says he nails the entry.
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,"Wait, weren't we supposed to bind his hands?"
689,2,14,51,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06230202312960611,559,The carbon fibre board does give a better bounce cap 'n.
689,1,16,50,67,1.2686567164179106,0.05855986724428589,559,Whatever happened to a good ole fashioned cannonball?
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,He wanted a swan dive to be his swan song.
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,"Yeah, he's been like this ever since we took him to Cirque du Soleil."
689,6,6,55,67,1.2686567164179106,0.07543658411895597,559,Did you happen to mention the sharks?
689,3,12,52,67,1.2686567164179106,0.0658318017406144,559,This is the last time he upstages me.
689,0,18,49,67,1.2686567164179106,0.05456165335924858,559,He's determined to get gold one way or another.
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,Arr! From now on we just shoot the Millennials.
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,"He can dive, but can he swim..."
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,I really hate that guy.
689,4,10,53,67,1.2686567164179106,0.06918171835672447,559,Swan Song
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,"Nice, but he can't swim."
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,WTF?
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,We should have just given him 100 lashes
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,I was kind of expecting a cannonball
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,"I said ""dying swain,"" not ""diving swan""!"
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,Argh! Everything is turning into a musical these days!
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,We should send a gold medal to his next of kin.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,I'd give it a 10 for execution.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,He's taking the wind out of our sails!
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,At least he died doing what he loved.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,You know...Its guys like him that take all the fun out of being a pirate.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,I say an eight. His arms be askew. Bring up the next finalist.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,"Once a wise-ass, always a wise-ass."
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,That my matey's is diving with dignity.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,Worst damn pirate I've ever seen.
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,Now that's death with dignity.
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,Did anyone remind him that it's Shark Week?
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,Now that's 'irrational exuberance'
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,So ends the mutiny of Calico Jack...Knife.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,If only he had scrubbed the deck with the same flourish.
724,1,15,49,65,1.2615384615384615,0.05914829422780653,559,Ok. Back to cannonballs.
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,You insubordinate bastard!
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,If only he could swim!
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,From now on they don't get a choice.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,7.5 maybe 8... I don't know. Let's see how the sharks liked it.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,"I told ye to die, not dive."
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,He always did have a flair for the dramatic.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,A welcome change from cannonballs.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,"He was never really one of us, was he?"
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,I thought he was supposed to do a half gainer.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,Can we go back to calling it a plank?
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,It's all in the execution mateys.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,"Arrrh, mateys, in like a pirate, out like a dove."
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,"He was always jolly, Roger."
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,"Ok, we'll throw out the low score and the high score"
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,Any more theoretical physicists aboard wanting to walk the Planck?
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,The dive has a degree of difficulty of just 1.4 but I give him 9.5 for his execution.
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,I knew we should have tied his hands.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,Now if he could only swim.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,I wasn't quite expecting his swan song to be a swan dive.
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,Mock the plank will ye?!
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,"Be careful, that's how I lost my leg."
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,Wait until he realizes the water is only 34 degrees.
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,I should have known this would happen when he danced the plank.
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,"Arrr, there's no taking the wind out of his sails!"
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,He's certainly going out in style.
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,"Five for difficulty, ten for attitude."
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,"A showboat, 'till the end, eh Carrrl?"
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,"He evidently missed the ‘Land, ho!’ announcement."
724,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,559,Next time water boarding.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,Aargh. A shame we'll never get to see his reverse pike.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,See now this is the very behavior I'm talking about!
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,He said walking the plank was beneath him
724,5,7,53,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07363149891952556,559,"He's not supposed to do that, is he?"
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,"Well if you gotta go, go with style!"
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,Only the French...
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,I told you we shouldn't have let him watch 'Peter Pan'.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,No way he sticks the landing.
724,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,559,that's the last time we Shanghi someone from the circus.
724,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,559,"Let the record show, he took the blows and did it his way."
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,"Remember, you score 8.5 or higher and we throw you a rope."
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,"9.8 for form. ""0 for survival"
784,1,14,48,63,1.253968253968254,0.059732523654257956,559,I get the feeling he's done this before.
784,1,14,48,63,1.253968253968254,0.059732523654257956,559,Guess he won't be in Tokyo in 2020.
784,3,10,50,63,1.253968253968254,0.06776459195111455,559,I wonder if he knows we are on a sandbar?
784,4,8,51,63,1.253968253968254,0.07144279314527355,559,"Aye, I didn't see THAT coming."
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,Heads or tails?

784,3,10,50,63,1.253968253968254,0.06776459195111455,559,Finally one that emphasizes artistry! I hate it when they only focus on the execution.
784,4,8,51,63,1.253968253968254,0.07144279314527355,559,Nice execution. Not what I had in mind though.

784,3,10,50,63,1.253968253968254,0.06776459195111455,559,This is a pirate ship not Cirque du Soleil.

784,4,8,51,63,1.253968253968254,0.07144279314527355,559,He said it was going to be his swan song.
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,These guys that live in the moment are ruining it for the rest of us.

784,5,6,52,63,1.253968253968254,0.07494067962392409,559,Now that's what I call making lemonade out of lemons!
784,5,6,52,63,1.253968253968254,0.07494067962392409,559,Nobody walks the plank like Louganis!
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,If he sticks the landing it's a 10.
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,He's making the best of it.
784,4,8,51,63,1.253968253968254,0.07144279314527355,559,"Aye Captain, I be given him a 10 on the dismount."
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,I guess it would be more of a punishment if we didn't anchor so close to the brothel next time.
784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,"Of course, they never do it when you ask."

784,2,12,49,63,1.253968253968254,0.06387493367670743,559,You have to admire his style.
784,3,10,50,63,1.253968253968254,0.06776459195111455,559,Not bad for someone who can't swim.
824,5,6,53,64,1.25,0.07386710503565985,559,Good execution. I give it a 9.
824,4,8,52,64,1.25,0.07042952122737638,559,I really hate cheerful people.
826,1,13,47,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06030767065058533,559,He takes planking to a whole new level.
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,The good news is that you've scored a perfect 10.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,"Swan song, ye scalliwag- not swan dive!"
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,"Man, over bored."
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,Going for gold.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,A class act till the end.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,I think he knows what he's doing .

826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,"Not what I meant when I said ""no more cannonballs""."
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,"Yeah, but can he do it with a wooden leg?"
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,"Yes, quite lovely. But you know they all taste the same once they hit the water."
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,I'd give him an 8. His toes are pointed but he didn't tuck his chin.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,"Degree of difficulty, 2 - Performance, 10"
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,Anyone that competent has no place in my administration.
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,He always goes so overboard...
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,You are taking the fun out of this!
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,"Remember... legs straight, toes pointed!"
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,"Okay okay, maybe it really was Greg Louganis."
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,Excellent execution but the degree of difficulty was lacking
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,"Come back here ye swab, yer supposed to 'WALK' the plank!"
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,I like his attitude.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,"Well, that diminished my sadistic satisfaction just a bit."
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,Arrrgh. So that's how he got that body - planks!
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,"Yeah, we know you were Johnny Depp's stuntman."

826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,I was hoping for a better deterrent effect.
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,"Aye, the first member of our scurvy crew to hold up a score-card gets keelhauled"
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,"You sure you explained ""walking the plank"" protocol?"
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,We need to find a tougher punishment.

826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,Good Lord! He's diving right out of the cartoon frame!
826,6,3,52,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07980761603041367,559,His be a Trump-like approach - makin’ a spectacle of his willful blindness to reality.
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,A perfect score of 10. I need one of you to go after him to let him know he won.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,I feel like a Kidd again.
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,It's only four feet deep here.
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,"I said, ""Swan SONG!"""
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,"How many times must we go over this? Legs straight, feet together!"
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,Looks like he's going for pirate gold.
826,5,5,51,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07630732264354612,559,He wants to go out with a splash.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,"He said it's called ""The Dead Man's Chest."""
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,He's still dropping his left shoulder slightly.
826,6,3,52,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07980761603041367,559,Now I understand why his last request was an Esther Williams movie.
826,1,13,47,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06030767065058533,559,Do you think our severance package is too generous?
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,He calls it pilates of the Caribbean.

826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,He certainly was a free spirit.
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,"Maybe it's me, but he's not taking this very seriously."
826,1,13,47,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06030767065058533,559,Said his name was Louganis.
826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,He's got his sea legs back.
826,2,11,48,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06467969717562974,559,The Russian shipmate scores it a 3.

826,3,9,49,61,1.2459016393442623,0.06877435069968206,559,We will have to rethink what it really means to walk the plank.
826,4,7,50,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07263855313533271,559,Now I remember. Canon ball. We forgot the canon ball.
826,6,3,52,61,1.2459016393442623,0.07980761603041367,559,"He calls that one 'America...November 8, 2016'."

1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,He said sharks don't eat swans.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,I give him a Ten for his execution.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,Really hate to see the two legged ones go.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,That'll be a hard plank to follow.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Apparently, his divorce was just finalized."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,It's just as well. He never really fit in anyway.
1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,It don't look very death-defying to me.
1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,"On the other hand, I'll miss his sense of humor."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Hence the nickname, Jolly Roger."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,What part of 'flawless execution' did you not understand?
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Now that's what I call ""glass half full""."
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,He used to do ballet.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Arrrgh! Not the Triple Lindy!
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,So this is what happens when we raid the oylimpics
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,That's the third one this week. We may need to adjust our approach.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,Showboat. My silver's on the sharks.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,I'm not sure he fully understands walking the plank.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,That's exactly why he had to walk the plank.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,He gets an 8 for take off and a 10 for execution.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,I didn't have the heart to tell him we haven't left the dock yet and it's only five feet of water.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,Argggh 9.5!
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,"I'll give ye good execution points, but thar better be no splash."
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,Aye...that's making the best of a bad situation.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,He's jumping ship!
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Too bad he failed the drug test.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,No more French pirates - I'm sick of their 'je ne sai quoi'
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,So that's how he got his gold.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,It's his cannonball that really knocks 'em dead.
1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,"Aargh, execution perfect."
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,The judges will still penalize him for being eaten.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,"Still, I'm going to miss him."
1174,4,3,45,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07929049280033962,559,A well executed double entendre
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,"Aye, 'tis a graceful arrrc."
1174,4,3,45,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07929049280033962,559,His last meal was a pot of coffee.
1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,All I ever ask for is a cannonball...
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,9.5 ....... 9.3 ....... 9.8!
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,I was kind of hoping for a forward two and a half somersaults in the pike position.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,That's Roger for you - jolly to the end.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Aye, he's going for the gold."
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,And let it be known that his kisses were just as spectacular.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"His form is good, but he can't say 'Arrghh' to save his life."
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,"Wait, that's not a cannonball..."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"No, you idiot! This is supposed to be your swan SONG, not your swan DIVE!"
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,"Finally ,someone who appreciates the moment"
1174,4,3,45,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07929049280033962,559,He said he's practicing for Tokyo 2020.
1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,He wanted to go out in style.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Arg, but let's see if he can stick the landing."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,I knew we shouldn't have let them practice.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,A show-off to the end.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,I think we should give him the gold!
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,"Like I said, he could talk the talk but he couldn't walk the walk."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"""6"" in Difficulty, ""10"" in Execution."
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,A doubloon says he belly flops.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,He was the ship's opera singer. This is his final performance.

1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,He calls this dive the Captain Hook.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,He's been doing that every day since the Ringling brothers went under.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,I give that 9.2 sharks.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"To his credit, Juan always did have a positive attitude."
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,Worst case of spring fever I've ever seen.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Well, he's going out with style."
1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,Nice to deal with a real professional for a change.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Maybe sharks appreciate flamboyant.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Overachiever.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Walking the plank has gone overboard.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,"Say what ya will, but he was a pirate's pirate - right up the end."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Well, I guess we know who stole the lime juice."
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,He's seen to many Errol Flynn movies.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Could be the first 10 we've ever seen!
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,That's going out with style!
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,"I give it a ten point zero, but I'll bet he can't do it again"
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,"Too much spring, not enough fall."

1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,I'd give it a nine.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,"Long Swan Silver, away!"
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,I had to get rid of him because he was always trying to one-up me!
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Sure, but how will he perform on platform?"
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,"I said, 'Shiver me timber', not 'Show me you're limber'."
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,He always did have style.

1174,4,3,45,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07929049280033962,559,A death-defying dive was a clever idea
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,I wouldn't have expected any less from Jolly Roger.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Mutinous to the end, I see."
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,He'll definitely make it to the finals this year.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"A little too high, but 9.3."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,It certainly is nice to see someone who can face adversity with aplomb.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,I'm sure I said:...his swan song.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,That is not what I meant by execution.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Too bad he still can't get the gold.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,This is the last time he demands a Matinee on the Bounty.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,That's the kind of sass that got him here.
1174,0,11,41,52,1.2115384615384615,0.05718733248399806,559,"Add ""insubordination"" to the list."
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,He did everything with panache. I despise panache.
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,"Aaarrggghh! I said 'walk', matey!"
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,I'll give it a 9.8 if there's no splash
1174,2,7,43,52,1.2115384615384615,0.06912804512336526,559,Amerigo's got talent.
1174,1,9,42,52,1.2115384615384615,0.0634392529086423,559,That's two 7s and an 8 for his last dive.
1174,3,5,44,52,1.2115384615384615,0.07438302518417335,559,"You had one job Rusty, one job."

1352,2,6,41,49,1.2040816326530612,0.07130699079332185,559,Arrrg!! Flamboyant Phil couldn't just walk the plank like everyone else.
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,Well he was an Olympian before he joined my crew!
1352,2,6,41,49,1.2040816326530612,0.07130699079332185,559,He'll get lots of likes on Facebook but he'll never know it!
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,"He's going for the gold, again."
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,No one on my ship's going to be more flamboyant than its captain.
1352,2,6,41,49,1.2040816326530612,0.07130699079332185,559,Oh No. He took the GPS.
1352,0,10,39,49,1.2040816326530612,0.058172215566282534,559,Disqualified for doping!
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,He's going for the Pieces of Eight.
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,Clearly not the first time he's walked the plank.
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,He's not going off the deep end.
1352,0,10,39,49,1.2040816326530612,0.058172215566282534,559,I'm old school. I like a tight cannonball.
1352,0,10,39,49,1.2040816326530612,0.058172215566282534,559,Now that's what I call a death defying leap.
1352,0,10,39,49,1.2040816326530612,0.058172215566282534,559,He falls to his death with the greatest of ease.
1352,0,10,39,49,1.2040816326530612,0.058172215566282534,559,He always wanted to go out on a high note.
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,Now if only his fencing were as good.
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,I prefer it when they cower.
1352,1,8,40,49,1.2040816326530612,0.06507185874050676,559,You'll never work in this town again!
1352,2,6,41,49,1.2040816326530612,0.07130699079332185,559,"That’s a nice enough dive, but someone needs to tell Peter that we are part of the Olympic sailing team."
1352,3,4,42,49,1.2040816326530612,0.07703912689051784,559,"Aye, silver. Gold if he nails the landing."
1352,2,6,41,49,1.2040816326530612,0.07130699079332185,559,Chutzpah.
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,This all could've been avoided if only you had told us where you hid the gold medals.
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Damn! I forgot he's the only one who knows how to operate the GPS.
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Just because he has style, it doesn't mean he's gay."
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Oh, that is just classic Jones."
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Sure the form is great. But what about ""degree of difficulty""?"
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"We're going to have to be more specific than, ""Exit this way."""
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Still trying to capture the gold!
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Too much shiver in the timber.
1479,4,2,44,50,1.2,0.08081220356417686,559,"Well, you were right about the liquor ration."
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,8.5 for take-off and 8.0 for elevation. Let's see how execution goes.
1479,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,Whatever. Let's see his entry.
1479,0,10,40,50,1.2,0.05714285714285714,559,"He has style, I'll give him that."
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,I give it 1.8 for Degree of Difficulty.
1479,4,2,44,50,1.2,0.08081220356417686,559,"Not only is he a Mexican stowaway, he's also a performance-enhancing drug user, so I persuaded him to self-deport."
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Final judgment: 8 if he sticks the landing.
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"I said, this is going to be your swan song, not your swan dive!"
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,It won't impress the sharks.
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,"Max enjoys walking the Planck, constantly."
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,Argh...somebody shoot him!
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"""We never said the amenities included an on-board pool""."
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,The last planker managed only a 7.8.
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Take-off 6. Elevation 9. Execution 7!
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Another reason we hate you!
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,He complimented tattoos and man buns but wouldn't say anything nice about me peg leg.
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Great height, let's watch for that entry."
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Always wondered why they call themselves ""the pirates of pizzazz"""
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"And for execution, I give his swan dive a 9 out of 10."
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Okay, I'll give him his dammed ""Ten."""
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"Okay, my mistake. You're not a piker."
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Oh well. Pirates don't have a team in the Olympics anyway.
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"I've seen better elevation, but high marks on degree of difficulty."
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,Spring is now in the air
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,You must admit I have a way of getting the best out of me men.
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,We've lost our edge.
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Argh...another swan song.
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,We'll have the last laugh when he sees the reef.
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Much less impressive without the Orca breaching.
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,"8.7, 9.2, 9.0"
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,You didn't tell me he was an Aculpoco pirate.
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,He's always been very flambuoyant.
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,"No, no, no... It can't be. Not the Triple Lindy!"
1479,3,4,43,50,1.2,0.07559289460184544,559,*and thus the diving board was formed*
1479,1,8,41,50,1.2,0.06388765649999399,559,argh! look at that booty
1479,2,6,42,50,1.2,0.06998542122237651,559,Fish this guy out. Guaranteed gold in 2020 and we'll all be rich!
1523,1,8,42,51,1.196078431372549,0.06274509803921571,559,"Obviously, HE doesn't have scurvy."
1523,1,8,42,51,1.196078431372549,0.06274509803921571,559,Good form. Low level of difficulty.
1523,1,8,42,51,1.196078431372549,0.06274509803921571,559,Joke's on him. We're aground. A foot o' water waitin' on him.
1523,3,4,44,51,1.196078431372549,0.07419956050362551,559,"Arrg, tis the last time he shows-off around here."
1523,3,4,44,51,1.196078431372549,0.07419956050362551,559,"He was supposed to tuck, not planck"
1523,1,8,42,51,1.196078431372549,0.06274509803921571,559,"Boys, this guy just gave me an idea that will turn our whole lives around when we get back to Penzance."
1523,2,6,43,51,1.196078431372549,0.06871143320758917,559,"What ship does he think he's on anyway, the Love Boat?"
1523,1,8,42,51,1.196078431372549,0.06274509803921571,559,We've got a loose cannon.
1523,1,8,42,51,1.196078431372549,0.06274509803921571,559,"Aye, a fine looking swan but without a tiny splash, the whole thing is crap."
1532,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,559,"Looks like he'll nail the entry, but let's see how he does on the exit."
1532,1,8,43,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06164206964379924,559,And good riddance to ye Crewman Phelps!
1532,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,559,It was this or another Senate hearing.
1532,2,6,44,52,1.1923076923076923,0.06748253524388616,559,"Argh, bugger thinks he's friggen Peter Pan... Riddence I say!"
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,Typical Dutchman.
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,"On a scale of 1-100, I give 'em-atey."
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,Approach was shaky but great execution.
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,Thems that flys will be the lucky ones.
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,He gets a 10 if he nails the entry.
1536,3,3,41,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07836380604827888,559,Third one this week. They've gotta sell springless planks somewhere!
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,You think he's trying to tell us something?
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,But the envelope said La La Land
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,I should've told him that's how I lost my leg.
1536,3,3,41,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07836380604827888,559,Now there's a guy who's going out with a splash.
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,"Good riddance, and you better not give us a bad rating on Uber!"
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,And that's why they called him Jolly Roger.
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,"Excellent dive, chum."
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,DIVERS OF THE CARIBBEAN
1536,0,9,38,47,1.1914893617021276,0.058014463349769285,559,Not exactly the fear inducing effect I was hoping for.
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,"Aye, too much shiver in that timber."
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,His rrrrrrrrrrrtistic performance is a ten.
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,He never was a cannonball kind of guy.
1536,3,3,41,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07836380604827888,559,"He told me he was Dutch, but I didn't make the connection."
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,His back is a bit over-arched. That's really going to hurt his score from the Russian pirates.
1536,0,9,38,47,1.1914893617021276,0.058014463349769285,559,Cannonball!
1536,0,9,38,47,1.1914893617021276,0.058014463349769285,559,You can't fire me! I quit!
1536,3,3,41,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07836380604827888,559,"We thought we had Michael Flynn, not Erroll"
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,Usually it's a cannonball.
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,I give him a 7 out of 10 for the delivery and a 9 out of 10 for the execution of his execution.
1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,If you make a big splash I'll kill you.
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,It's his swan dive.
1536,0,9,38,47,1.1914893617021276,0.058014463349769285,559,I knew Louganis would leave. He wasn't much of a pirate.
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,I asked for your swan SONG.
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,"It's a 4.9 out of 5, but he's still eliminated!"
1536,3,3,41,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07836380604827888,559,He's jumping to conclusions.
1536,3,3,41,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07836380604827888,559,"Maybe we ought to rethink your plank-walking idea, Renwick."
1536,0,9,38,47,1.1914893617021276,0.058014463349769285,559,Glad to see the last of the captured crew from the Olympia!

1536,2,5,40,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07222061144970149,559,More evidence of his narcissistic personality disorder!
1536,1,7,39,47,1.1914893617021276,0.06550379636299898,559,I'm not going to miss him.
1536,3,3,41,47,1.1914893617021276,0.07836380604827888,559,This looser jumps ship rather see America great again. Sad

1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,Where did he learn that?
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,He always has to make a mockery of everything.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,"Arrrh, mateys, the plank bit ain't workin'. Let's award him his damn 10 and disembowel him on deck."

1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,I doubt the sharks are impressed.
1838,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,559,Damn...he promised me a forward somersault with two-and-a-half twists.

1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,They don't call him Captain Kidd for nothing.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,It’s amazing what a clear conscience can do for a guy.
1838,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,559,Gold
1838,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,559,"He was always graceful, even in the end."
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,Arrr. Methinks that's at least good enough for the all-fleet semifinals.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,Not sure that guy is getting the message.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,"That's nothing, you should see him when we put out the water slide!"
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,"Can you believe it, he wanted us to take passengers to places like Alaska and Cabo San Lucas?"
1838,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,559,Damn...we should have kept him for the diving team.
1838,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,559,Another Peter Pan wannabe.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,I give him a score of six argghhs.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,Now that's what I call a positive spin.

1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,"I will walk the plank . . . and nobody walks planks better than me, believe me."""

1838,3,1,38,42,1.1666666666666667,0.08289664910495505,559,Arrggh. We shoulda hung him from the yardarm.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,Out like Flynn.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,Fish him out of the water. His layout position needs more work.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,He's never really been part of the crew.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,"All right, mateys, we quit raiding Acapulco."
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,He's saving us a fortune on retirement costs.
1838,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,559,He's not a Walk the Plank kind of guy.
1838,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,559,Now that’s how you jump to a conclusion!
1838,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,559,A show off right to the end.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,He never would take things seriously.
1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,We make him walk for bad attitude and we get this...
1838,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,559,Now there's a man with an attitude

1838,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,559,Now that's what I call chutzpah.

1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,I'd give him an 8.5 for form. It's his attitude that bugs me...

1838,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,559,He said he wanted out before Trump took over.

2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,Go get a musket. I think he's caught a thermal.

2220,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,559,"A five for execution, but I can't fault him on style."
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,I'm recusing. We're getting too close to Russia.
2220,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,559,So we're all in agreement – no more intern pirates from Stanford.
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,"In retrospect, we probably should have used the sword."

2220,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,559,"Umm, does he realize it's only 3 feet deep?"
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,Notice how his feet are together. It's a 10 so far.
2220,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,559,"Last week, he couldn't even do a cannonball."
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,"Swan song, swan dive, meh."
2220,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,559,This one qualifies for the semifinal.

2220,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,559,I'm not surprised. He's always steered clear of any political party's plank.
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,He's stealing my joy.
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,"He deserved his punishment, but I'm gonna miss First Mate Louganis"
2220,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,559,I meant it figuratively.
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,Just want to ask what for dinner?
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,So that's why he didn't want a mask.
2220,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,559,Definitely a ten ... unless he makes a big splash.
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,Where's the Russian judge when you need them? Perfect 10.

2220,2,2,36,40,1.15,0.07637626158259735,559,Was he tested?
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,I told him not to go gentle.
2220,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,559,Argh! The albatross dive has a much higher degree-of-difficulty.

2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,List'n Up! The next person to swan dive while walk'n the plank is disqualified!
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"Some would call that a death spiral, but it looks like a swan dive to me"
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"First Mate, Bellemy makes a career change."
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"I'll give 'em 8 out of 10, but that still doesn't make up for what he did to my parrot."
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"But he stole me silver, so he'll have to settle for the bronze."
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"So that makes the scores a 9, a 9.5 and a piece of 8."
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"I said, ""Swan SONG!"""

2323,2,1,34,37,1.135135135135135,0.07905373321974885,559,What a way to go out ---- A PERFECT SWAN DIVE --- poor devil.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"Well, if you gotta go, might as well swan-diving the plan instead of walking the plank"
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"Aye, at least he went out in style!"

2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,I knew he would go in style.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Such beautiful form. Swan was always his best dive.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Wait lads! Don't grade him till he hits the water.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,I never did like that guy's attitude.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,We are getting better at this!
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,He'll never get gold without the triple dammit !

2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"Uh Captain, I think we should have chosen harsher punishment than walk-the-plank."
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,Why is he leaving a trail?
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Am I doing it right?
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,I give him a ten if he survives. The water is only three feet deep there.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,Good luck in Seoul!
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"He said ""See if you can Trump this."""
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,He said he always gets the gold.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"His approach was pathetic, but I'll give him an 8.5 for take off and elevation."
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,To think he used to work at Price Waterhouse!
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,He thinks it is the tryout for the Olympics.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"Swan dive, eh? He seemed like more of a kicking and screaming kind of guy."
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,Here comes another cannonball.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"8.5, 8.5, 8.5; 2.0 for difficulty"
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,This way we get the gold medal AND the bragging rights.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Yar. I won't miss the showin' off.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,I'd give his death an 8.5.

2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,Did you say 'plank' or 'plunk'
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,How's his cannonballs?
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,He gets it from the Sparrow side of the family.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Call me old fashion but I prefer the cannonball.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,He was just too darn high and mighty.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Apparently Phelps is looking forward to the water.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,I'll give him a 9.5 for that execution.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,We have a strict No Drama Students policy.

2323,2,1,34,37,1.135135135135135,0.07905373321974885,559,Sure he looks good. He's a recidivist.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,Very bad attitude.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,He's really going for the gold.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,He really was a show off...
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Nine.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,I'm kinda sorry to see him go.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,He always went the extra mile without ever being asked!
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"Excellent execution, captain! or Excellent execution, cap'n!"
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"Damn, he had my cellphone."

2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,All I said was we're outta rum.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,We should have keelhauled him.
2323,2,1,34,37,1.135135135135135,0.07905373321974885,559,"You dumb asses, I said 'waterboarding', not 'this board over water'.."

2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,Enjoy it while it lasts.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Woe be upon him who didn't meet medal expectations.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"Walk the plank into Provincetown Harbor, you scallywag!"
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,Ten coins says he splashes it.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"Nice technique, but low degree of difficulty. Leave him for the sharks."

2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,Great form for so little practice.
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,"Blimey, I think he's been here before."
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,"An okay dive, but a high degree of difficulty."
2323,1,3,33,37,1.135135135135135,0.06890566910260519,559,I told him we're testing floating trampolines.

2323,2,1,34,37,1.135135135135135,0.07905373321974885,559,Aargh. I'd give the bloke an 8. He shoulda kept his head back a pinch more.
2323,0,5,32,37,1.135135135135135,0.05697797585888971,559,When I first laid eyes on that scoundrel he reminded me of a young Greg Louganis.

2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,This is his way of going out in style.
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,We've finally heard the last of his 'I could do that blindfolded' bragging.
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,A Trump supporter's mindset is hard to fathom.
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,The Russian judge gave hime a 9.5.

2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,He's in it for the applause.
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,"Pretty good, but let's see if he sticks the landing."
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,"You knew the penalty for having designer steroids, matey!"
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,"What did he mean by ""there goes my chance to be in the Olympics""?"
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,I told you he schemed to jump ship.
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,I'll give him a 6.2 because his landing is going to suck.
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,He doesn't like being on board.
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,They seem happier knowing we have paid family leave after a good plundering.
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,"Not much degree of difficulty, but I'll give the swashbulkler a ten."

2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,did we smell that bad?
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,I read about that. It’s called the Peter Pan Syndrome.
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,So that's why he was whistling the theme song from the Olympics.

2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,That's not the kind of booty we want on this ship.
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,I just hope our liability insurance is current!

2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,"Six pack or not, he's beginning to take these plank exercise too seriously"

2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,"If you could dive like that, your future would be assured."
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,"I think ""no dessert"" is a more effective punishment."
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,He used to dive for Stanford.
2648,1,2,31,34,1.1176470588235294,0.07020095781645355,559,"Aye, he puts the jolly in Roger."
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,"And here's Theo ""Coconut Crazy"" Ramsay with the flying forward one-and-a-half somersaults, pike."
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,He's going to prove our story about shark infested waters is fake news.

2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,I'm adding some fabulous to this execution.
2648,0,4,30,34,1.1176470588235294,0.05608603466150544,559,But he just ate.

2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,Not what we meant by going belly up
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,Jack hasn't figured out the concept yet.
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"""After he comes out of the Pike Posit"
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,"Say what you will about him, but I always admired his style and optimism."
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,"Oh great, now everyone is going to want to mutiny."
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,Everybody's a show off these days.

2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,Maybe we should have thrown him in the brier patch.
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"We came for the pillaging and plundering, but stayed for the pirate-technics!"
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,I'm predicting a 10 from the Russian judge.
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,Clegg always did have a flair for the dramatic...

2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,I really didn't think he'd top his plank sashay.
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,Arrgh! Who said anything about a swan song with walking the plank!
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,I give him a 9.5!
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,I don't think he grasps the severity of this punishment.
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,He should have won gold at the Olympics...
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"Be careful, I'm not sure how deep the water is here !"
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"I said walk the plank, not jump into the ocean like a salty sea swan! These prisoners take too many liberties nowadays. I gotta get out of this pirate business. The planks just not what it used to be."
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"Argo. This a first. ""Walking the plank"" in the Pike position."
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,Aft deck pilates has really done wonders for his range of motion.
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"Avast ye, maties! It's Jack Swan!"

2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,Damn shame the Olympic Committee listed a bottle of rum as a doping agent.
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,Jumping the plank.
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,A swan dive is his swan song? Too theatrical!
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"See, he did get into the grog"
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,We have to factor in the degree of difficulty.
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,"Not bad, but I'm partial to the armstand back double somersault with a twist."
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"Aye, for his swan song he choose a swan dive, jolly good, Roger"
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"Maybe we should have taken it seriously when the Olympics Committee called. That's a ""10""."
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,He's got some spring in his step!
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,Plank this...
2929,1,2,32,35,1.1142857142857143,0.0682485395100738,559,Well... Your right... He did book a first class cabin...
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,"No, that is not a 10.0 - his arms are in the wrong position!"
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,We didn't expect him to have fun!
2929,0,4,31,35,1.1142857142857143,0.054563640607556065,559,Who knew he'd be a future Olympian?
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,Don't we have any more Speedos?
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,These Trump appointees do like to go out in style. NEXT!
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,Full fathom 5.0.
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,Maybe it was his gold medal.
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,He's an OLympic medallist you know - although I'm not so sure about his swimming.
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,Thar's that arrrrrrrch!
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,"He's good. But with a difficulty rating of only 1.2, I can't see him making the final."
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,That swabbie always had elan.
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,Look a perfect 10
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,"I'M DISAPPOINTED, CAPTAIN PIKE!"
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,"Aye, keel-hauling would have robbed us of his true talent."
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,"Not bad me hearties, but if he can't pillage and plunder, he's a land-lubbing scallywag in me book!"
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,The grand finale
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,"I haven't had my coffee, mate."
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,I'd say about a 9.7
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,"Work like a captain, play like a pirate"
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,Swan dive away from all the problems of the Trump administration.
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,Form and function. He's got it all.
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,Maybe he knows something we don't?
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,What a finish!
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,So glad he took it this way.
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,Now I know why he volunteered!
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,"Arch, extend, head back...good!"
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,He yo ho ho'd and drank all the rum.
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,He is not in trouble; he is just practicing for upcoming Pirate Olympics.
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,I still say it's easier to just steal the gold.
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,"If he sticks the entry, I'll give him a 10!"
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,Another cabinet member lost at sea.
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,"The Swan Dive, very appropriate."
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,That's the last we'll see of Captain Swan.
2968,0,4,32,36,1.1111111111111112,0.05312127152597306,559,"Impressive, but I doubt he'll make it to Regionals."
2968,1,2,33,36,1.1111111111111112,0.06640158940746632,559,"Shiver m'timbers, Flying Jolly Roger, fearless to the end!"
3000,0,4,33,37,1.1081081081081081,0.05175281663547772,559,"Aye, yer approach and takeoff are fine Edwards, but ye still have to nail the entry."
3000,0,4,33,37,1.1081081081081081,0.05175281663547772,559,"Yeah, he's auditioning for that Penzance thing."
3000,1,2,34,37,1.1081081081081081,0.06465180222706,559,"Arghhh, swan dive!"
3000,0,4,33,37,1.1081081081081081,0.05175281663547772,559,I wish we'd made him wear a puffy shirt?
3000,0,4,33,37,1.1081081081081081,0.05175281663547772,559,No more coffee or sweet cookies before execution time.
3000,0,4,33,37,1.1081081081081081,0.05175281663547772,559,"Quite the swan song, eh mateys?"

3000,1,2,34,37,1.1081081081081081,0.06465180222706,559,"Aarrgh, I wanted to yell cannonball!"
3000,0,4,33,37,1.1081081081081081,0.05175281663547772,559,Red Belly always hated cannonballs.
3000,1,2,34,37,1.1081081081081081,0.06465180222706,559,8.2! If he survives he'll be in the running for the gold dubloon!
3010,0,3,28,31,1.096774193548387,0.053978066228004884,559,"Philip, have you ever seen something so, beautiful?"
3010,0,3,28,31,1.096774193548387,0.053978066228004884,559,I said WALK the plank!
3010,1,1,29,31,1.096774193548387,0.0711629768076314,559,The sharks aren't going to like this.
3010,0,3,28,31,1.096774193548387,0.053978066228004884,559,"Does he really think a perfect ""10"" will save him?"
3010,1,1,29,31,1.096774193548387,0.0711629768076314,559,Now that Roger is jolly!
3010,0,3,28,31,1.096774193548387,0.053978066228004884,559,Argh!! I said it's 'Leap Year' not 'Leap dear!'
3010,0,3,28,31,1.096774193548387,0.053978066228004884,559,"I said, 'Swab' not 'Swan'!"
3010,0,3,28,31,1.096774193548387,0.053978066228004884,559,"On the flip side, it's the right way to go."
3010,0,3,28,31,1.096774193548387,0.053978066228004884,559,Blimey! I said WALK THE PLANK.
