5896,2438,3,12,57,72,1.25,0.06176207566630455,589,"""I recommend the Big Salad""."
5797,2438,3,11,54,68,1.25,0.06415178992833838,589,Our menu has expanded...
5781,2438,2,13,53,68,1.25,0.06063390625908324,589,The portions are laughably small.
5766,2438,2,13,53,68,1.25,0.06063390625908324,589,"Well if you wanted me to list the specials, you should have made an earlier reservation."
5724,2438,4,9,55,68,1.25,0.06748654468695238,589,How come there are no specials?
5927,2438,3,11,54,68,1.25,0.06415178992833838,589,We'd had complaints about the small print.

5269,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,Chef takes his inspiration from life in the Big Apple.
5026,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,You still need to pick one from Column Y and one from column Z.

4792,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,"Perhaps, Sir would like to use our Nook version."
4755,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,I'm sorry sir but we only serve tapas.
4749,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,"I'm sorry, we're out of cheesecake."
4717,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,The chef used to work at The Cheesecake Factory.

3971,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,It's to make the prices look smaller.
3968,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,"Sorry, we are out of that as well"
3932,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,Most of our guests are older

5996,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,It's the condensed version.
5839,2739,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,589,King Kong just loved the Grilled Bananas
5836,2739,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,589,"Don't worry, the servings are small."

5680,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,"As signore is perhaps aware, for more than 75 years Luigi's has prided itself in offering the largest menu in town."
5678,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,Would it be correct to assume that small plates are not offered?
5663,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,Shall I roll out our list of specials?
5646,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,"If you don't feel like reading all that, we have smorgasbord on Wednesday night."
5644,2739,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,589,The owner is from Texas
5623,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,Our chef will be delighted. Everyone else orders a la carte.
5582,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,"Sorry, we don't have any beef dishes, sir."
5539,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,We are out of a few things
5529,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,"Pardon, do you need any help with the menu?"
5712,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,May I suggest something large to start with?
3891,2739,0,15,49,64,1.234375,0.053369535239372906,589,Would you like to see our tapas menu?
5382,2739,0,15,49,64,1.234375,0.053369535239372906,589,"Or, you could order from the children's menu."
3754,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,"The menu is bit cumbersome to some, but our owner insists it's the appropriate size for his hands..."
2592,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,Need more time?
2576,2739,4,7,53,64,1.234375,0.06951571243822256,589,We DO have interesting ways to hide your mistress. Wait til you see our 14 foot high shrimp cocktail.
2550,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,And would you like that to be lunch or dinner portion?
2532,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,I'd recommend the jumbo sized shrimp.
2456,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,"Monseigneur, we offer fine dining NOT fine print."
2429,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,"Yes, sir! We're not kidding when we say we have the largest menu in midtown Manhattan!"
2272,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,Can I keep the menu?
2262,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,... and NONE of them are organic-gluten-free-range-localvore?
2217,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,Our guest chef today is from Brobdingnag.
2611,2739,3,9,52,64,1.234375,0.06585136695439135,589,"""We needed a large size menu to fit all the zeros""."
2181,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,"No Monsieur, I haven’t had the opportunity to try that yet. I’ve only been here forty-two years."
1970,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,We're overcompensating for very small portions.
1903,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,Soy clams? Three rows from the bottom on the right.
1890,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,I'm gonna need a few minutes.
1888,2739,0,15,49,64,1.234375,0.053369535239372906,589,Welcome to Trump's Trattoria! We are putting the men back in menu.
1858,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,I recommend that you allow me to just surprise you.
1826,2739,5,5,54,64,1.234375,0.07299634252361824,589,"The menu just reflects our prices, sir."
1787,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,Now that’s a tall order.
1773,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,Ah. Yes. We've added a new craft beer selection.
3860,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,We're proud to offer the largest menu in the city...and you should see our small plates.
2132,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,Perhaps sir would like to order from something a little more his size?
2618,2739,1,13,50,64,1.234375,0.05783026057090191,589,You may supersize anything on the menu.
1756,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,You really used some big words here
2769,2739,2,11,51,64,1.234375,0.061970725215460876,589,"Yes, the 'small plate' trend is so over."
