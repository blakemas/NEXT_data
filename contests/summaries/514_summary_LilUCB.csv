579,1,14,17,32,1.5,0.10040241611281235,514,We gotta git a better hobby.
579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,Give us a break. It was just a bag of wooden nickels!
579,4,8,20,32,1.5,0.1270001270001905,514,We need fresh horses. Ride for the lumber yard.

579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,I say we dismount and run for it.
579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,How the west was fun.
579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,"Dang! They get closer, then farther, then closer, then father, then..."
579,2,14,20,36,1.5,0.101574900036674,514,I think our producer is running out of money.
579,2,10,16,28,1.5,0.12062447740929098,514,The capguns were an even worse idea.
579,4,9,21,34,1.5,0.12126781251816648,514,We'll have a better chance of losing them if we split up!
579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,Wait - Billy's NOT a kid?

579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,How did they know I was Billy the Kid.
579,4,9,21,34,1.5,0.12126781251816648,514,"What do ya mean, We ain't going nowhere?"

579,3,9,18,30,1.5,0.12456821978060995,514,I think we should splinter up.
579,1,14,17,32,1.5,0.10040241611281235,514,"I'll rock right, you rock left."
579,5,7,22,34,1.5,0.12840721766021207,514,This isn't what I had in mind when I suggested wild west reenactments as a hobby.
579,2,14,20,36,1.5,0.101574900036674,514,You think this ridiculous? Wait until tomorrow when they shoot the river-crossing scene.
579,3,10,19,32,1.5,0.11879774082787287,514,"O.K. it's been 30 minutes, can we be the sheriffs now?"
579,4,8,20,32,1.5,0.1270001270001905,514,Stop or I'll squirt!
579,2,10,16,28,1.5,0.12062447740929098,514,Yet another great American tradition that PETA has managed to neuter.
579,2,12,18,32,1.5,0.10998533626601496,514,"Holt, we gotta get new hobbies."

579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,Somehow it don't seem so wild anymore.
579,3,10,19,32,1.5,0.11879774082787287,514,"Still think we're playing games, pardner?"
579,3,8,17,28,1.5,0.13113263207824052,514,"No really, I'm having fun, this just wasn't what I was expecting for my bachelor party."

579,3,11,20,34,1.5,0.11368091818174797,514,Maybe we should have taken the getaway pogo stick.
579,1,14,17,32,1.5,0.10040241611281235,514,Don't make me pull out my water pistol!
579,4,9,21,34,1.5,0.12126781251816648,514,Just keep ridin' pardner...they'll never catch us!
579,1,15,18,34,1.5,0.09673824874398686,514,Let's just settle this in a manly way.Squirt guns at ten paces.

1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"C'mon guys, it's only Monopoly money."
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Your horse is lame.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Them walnut models is too fast for us, Tex."
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"Sorry, Guys...but we're about to leave you in our sawdust!"
1130,0,10,15,25,1.4,0.1,514,My five-year-old warned me about this.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Lucky we got that 10 hour head start.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Hurry! The rocking cows are stampeding
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Dagnabnit! We should have taken Uber!
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,"When the application said 'Rocking Horse Ranch,' I thought they were talking about the brand."
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Just make sure you crop the bottom a bit before you post it.
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,When we catch you you're going straight to time out!
1130,0,10,15,25,1.4,0.1,514,"They are gaining on us, but I think that we still are two months ahead."
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Drat! The posse’s on skateboards.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,All we stole was candy.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,"Sheriff, do you see this as something more than a hobby?"
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Doing zero is speeding in this county?
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"Knockers to the rockers, Frank! They're gaining on us!"
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Dang termites are slowing me down Bill
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,But I thought you said this was a dude ranch for people whose hobby is horses!
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Told you we should have gotten here earlier for the spin class!
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,This is just a hobby.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Once I get to the merry-go-round you'll never catch me.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Stalemate?
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,"Hope you got some fresh caps in that gun of yours, Sheriff."
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,How much farther to the playroom?
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Sheriff, if you think we're gonna catch these bandits, you must be off your rocker!"
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,I'm the man who rocked Liberty Valance
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Giddy up and down!
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"You'll never catch us, not here on the Rockies."
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Clearly it's not a hobby with them!
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,So much for your 'pretend' hold-up
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,What if we jumped off and ran?
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,We're changing horses in the next town.
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"Nah, nah - you can't catch us!"
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,They're almost gaining on us.
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Ever feel like you're in a Ken Burns documentary?
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,The Kid never gives up!
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Dang, they're gainin' on us and we're out of caps!"
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,I'm telling mom!
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"Ride like the wind, Mahogany!"
1130,4,2,19,25,1.4,0.15275252316519466,514,it's not a hobby ... it's a business.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,They can't touch us once we get to our bouncy hideout!
1130,4,2,19,25,1.4,0.15275252316519466,514,The crappiest cowboy dream I ever had
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,I told you we should've taken the horses with springs.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Darn it, Sundance. One of the posse guys is mocking me. Everytime I touch my hat, he touches his."
1130,3,6,21,30,1.4,0.12317635241028796,514,"Well Jesse, it doesn't look like they're gainin' on us."
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Whose idea was it to follow the P.E.T.A. guidelines?
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,I wouldn't give a wooden nickel for these mustangs.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,They'll never catch us at this rate!

1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,It's better for your core!
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Do you mind if we stop for a nap and some milk and cookies?
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,We did not steal your strollers!
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Make America Giddy Up again!
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,What's the mileage on these things?
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Don't forget, it's just a game!"
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,"They're gaining on us... oh, wait, it just appears that they're gaining on us."
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,What are the odds that their horses are just as fast as our horses?
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,And they said crime doesn't play.
1130,0,10,15,25,1.4,0.1,514,Don't worry. They're urban cowboys too.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,They're gaining!
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,We just can't lose them!
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Every man needs a hobby.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,"Watch out, it's Rocker Texas Ranger!"
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"They got fresh phonies, Jake!"
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"Who ARE these guys? No matter what we do, we can't lose 'em, Butch!"
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"The posse's gaining on us, pard! Put another quarter in the slot."
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Don't shot sherif, we're just horsing around!"
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Why don't you get a new hobby?
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Hobbyists!
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Faster! We're almost at the Merry Go Round!
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,The chase isn't what it use to be.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Rock faster, they're catching up with us."
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Don't worry, the Indians are on Big Wheels."
1130,0,10,15,25,1.4,0.1,514,"Goldarnit, they've gained another inch on us!"
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Let's get back to the birthday party.
1130,4,2,19,25,1.4,0.15275252316519466,514,"I said to get us some BAY stallions, Clem, not EBAY stallions!"
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Next time I get be the sheriff.
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,I thought we would have lost these guys by now!
1130,0,10,15,25,1.4,0.1,514,You have no chance of catching us before the statute of limitations runs out.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,This is the last gol durn time I take a role in a Wes Anderson western.
1130,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,"Don't know 'bout you, Sheriff, but this is the second-saddest horse chase I've ever been in."
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,This isn't what I meant when I said I wanted to rock your world.
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Rock harder! They're gaining.
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"Keep rockin'! At this pace, they'll never catch up!"
1130,0,10,15,25,1.4,0.1,514,"They may be relentless, but at least they're not gaining on us."
1130,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Keep ridin'! If they catch us we're in for a good spankin'!

1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,That's right Sheriff! The name is Billy the Kid!
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,I think we lost them – unless of course they ditch the horses and walk over to us
1130,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,This Cowboys and Indians thing is starting to feel childish
