151,4,10,11,25,1.72,0.1474222959166399,514,That's why they call me Billy the Kid.
151,4,10,11,25,1.72,0.1474222959166399,514,Screw the carbon footprint. I want a real horse.

151,5,8,12,25,1.72,0.1583245611605056,514,How in hell can they be gaining on us?
151,5,8,12,25,1.72,0.1583245611605056,514,I ain't goin' back to the nursery.

167,4,9,11,24,1.7083333333333333,0.1532163227136512,514,I think our producer is running out of money.
167,4,9,11,24,1.7083333333333333,0.1532163227136512,514,"Calm down, Sheriff! It's just a hobby!"

167,5,7,12,24,1.7083333333333333,0.16461600758034078,514,They never should have allowed that animal rights lawyer on the set.

177,4,8,11,23,1.6956521739130435,0.15948016602238743,514,I sure hope this scene looks better in post-production.
177,4,8,11,23,1.6956521739130435,0.15948016602238743,514,You think this ridiculous? Wait until tomorrow when they shoot the river-crossing scene.

177,4,8,11,23,1.6956521739130435,0.15948016602238743,514,I told you we should have gone for the pogo sticks!

199,3,11,11,25,1.68,0.1380821011813865,514,Can't never send us back to the play pen!
199,3,11,11,25,1.68,0.1380821011813865,514,This is exactly the sort of thing I warned you about when we became piggy bank robbers.
199,4,9,12,25,1.68,0.14966629547095764,514,Guess it's time to find a new hobby.
199,6,5,14,25,1.68,0.17048949136725894,514,"No seriously, you'll never catch us."

199,3,11,11,25,1.68,0.1380821011813865,514,What if we jumped off and ran?
199,4,9,12,25,1.68,0.14966629547095764,514,When suburban mommas let their babies grow up to be cowboys...
199,6,5,14,25,1.68,0.17048949136725894,514,My mom wants to know if we want to have lunch after.
199,5,7,13,25,1.68,0.16041612554021284,514,We'll be okay so long as they don't dismount and start walking after us.
199,4,9,12,25,1.68,0.14966629547095764,514,The animal rights people are killing the West.
199,5,7,13,25,1.68,0.16041612554021284,514,"Watch out, the deputy's goin' for his cap gun!!"
199,5,7,13,25,1.68,0.16041612554021284,514,So they never tire. There were other things you should have considered.
199,6,5,14,25,1.68,0.17048949136725894,514,We can't seem to shake them!
199,4,9,12,25,1.68,0.14966629547095764,514,"The good news is, they only have cap guns..."
199,4,9,12,25,1.68,0.14966629547095764,514,Speeding? How fast were we going?

199,6,5,14,25,1.68,0.17048949136725894,514,They're gaining on us--now they're falling back....
199,5,7,13,25,1.68,0.16041612554021284,514,PETA has gained far too much influence.
199,5,7,13,25,1.68,0.16041612554021284,514,I think I know why this dude ranch was cheaper.
199,4,9,12,25,1.68,0.14966629547095764,514,That's the last time we knock over a piggy bank.
199,5,7,13,25,1.68,0.16041612554021284,514,Told you we should've taken an Uber!
199,4,9,12,25,1.68,0.14966629547095764,514,Ya'll ever feel like the conceptual potential of the cartoon we're trapped in is a bit limited?

359,2,8,10,20,1.6,0.1521771820505364,514,We've got company.
359,6,3,16,25,1.6,0.17320508075688773,514,This is the last low budget movie I work on
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,How the hell are they gaining on us!
359,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,514,They might be gaining on us.
359,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,514,Dang! We just cant shake these guys!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,Back off or you'll never see your blocks again.
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,"I think they're gaining on us, wait -- maybe not..."
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,"If you think you can catch us, you're off your rocker!"
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,Can we finish this after nap time?
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,This is absolutely positively the last movie I make with this studio!
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,"They're gaining on us. Wait, we're getting away! No, they're gaining on us. Wait, we're getting away!"
359,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,514,Your mother rode a porch swing!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,Hobbyists!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,"They're gaining on us, Clem! I told you the termites wouldn't work!"
359,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,514,"Hold on now, fellers - it's almost nap time."
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,"Quick, hand me the termites."
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,You're after the wrong guys! We're not real horse thieves. This is just a hobby!
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,We'll lose them in Carousel Canyon.
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,You'll never catch Billy the Kiddie!
359,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,514,Don't make me pull out my water pistol!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,"I won't do hard time-out again, Sheriff!"
359,2,11,12,25,1.6,0.12909944487358055,514,And we're holding your teddy bear for ransom!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,We're caught between a rocking horse and a hard place.
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,Hi Ho Sliver.
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,Head them off at the sandbox
359,1,13,11,25,1.6,0.11547005383792516,514,Getting out of Dodge has its ups and downs.
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,He's got a squirt gun!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,"But Sheriff, we never robbed no piggy bank!"
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,"Look, I'm all for reducing greenhouse gases, but there has to be a happy medium."
359,1,13,11,25,1.6,0.11547005383792516,514,If you come any closer I'll be forced to use my cap gun!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,"Next time, I get to be sheriff."
359,4,7,14,25,1.6,0.15275252316519466,514,Do you think we can out rock them?
359,5,5,15,25,1.6,0.16329931618554522,514,"Sure, it all seems bogus - until you check out the numbers on your Fitbit."
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,P.E.T.A. ruins everything.
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,Faster! They're about to dismount and walk over here!
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,What do you say we stop and water the horses ?
359,3,9,13,25,1.6,0.1414213562373095,514,"Oh, yeah? Well, I've got a ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" card!"
399,4,8,15,27,1.5925925925925926,0.14381116198431868,514,I always wondered why they called you Billy the Kid.
399,2,12,13,27,1.5925925925925926,0.12240769834154322,514,"Rock faster, they're gaining on us!"
399,4,8,15,27,1.5925925925925926,0.14381116198431868,514,The Director promised they would sort it out in the special effects studio
399,5,6,16,27,1.5925925925925926,0.15339704417061883,514,Ride faster or they'll catch us by naptime.
399,5,6,16,27,1.5925925925925926,0.15339704417061883,514,Did not!
399,4,8,15,27,1.5925925925925926,0.14381116198431868,514,This is the last time we rob a toy train.
399,4,8,15,27,1.5925925925925926,0.14381116198431868,514,Las’ time I let you git the horses.
399,4,8,15,27,1.5925925925925926,0.14381116198431868,514,You will literally NEVER catch us.
407,2,9,11,22,1.5909090909090908,0.14201839569111904,514,As long as they stay on the horses we'll be fine.
407,3,7,12,22,1.5909090909090908,0.15651910121031104,514,We need more quarters!
407,5,3,14,22,1.5909090909090908,0.1820885435761741,514,"They're gaining on us, no, wait- they're falling back, no- they are gaining on us, wait..."
407,2,9,11,22,1.5909090909090908,0.14201839569111904,514,"If you think this is bad, try robbing a bank with a cap gun!"
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,Don't make me draw my squirt gun!
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,Hurry up! They're almost within cap gun range!
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,So how was I to know they have a Rocking Equestrian Special Forces Unit?
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,"Watch out, he's going for his cap gun."
411,5,4,15,24,1.5833333333333333,0.16936225931188761,514,Looks like we're caught between a rock and a hard pace.
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,"They're not gaining on us, but we're not losing them either."
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,We're okay - unless they decide to shoot....
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,You'll never take us alive...or before nap time!
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,We shouldn't have bought our horses at Hobby Lobby.
411,2,10,12,24,1.5833333333333333,0.13346913374198452,514,We can't seem to lose them.
411,2,10,12,24,1.5833333333333333,0.13346913374198452,514,We'll have a better chance of losing them if we split up!
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,I hope this looks better on the big screen
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,Splinter!? Last time it was your hat blowing off.....
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,"Hold onto your hats boys, this is gonna be a long ride"
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,"I asked ""WOULD"" horses be faster!"
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,"Actually, they're not gaining on us."
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,They're still on our tail!
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,You'll never catch the Big-Boy Gang!
411,1,12,11,24,1.5833333333333333,0.1191252334983594,514,They never got this close on the merry-go-round!
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,"Well, they're not gaining on us."
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,At least they're not gaining on us.
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,We'll lose 'em in that Toys 'R' Us.
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,"I said wood in whores, not wooden horse!"
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,"Shouldn't be long now, I loosened the screws in their horses."
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,Why so seroius .... it's just a hobby.
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,"Just give it up, boys. You ain't getting no where."
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,Another low-budget Western.
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,Look out! They're having more fun than we are!
411,2,10,12,24,1.5833333333333333,0.13346913374198452,514,I'm thinking maybe we'd do better on foot.
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,I've got a squirt gun and I'm not afraid to use it!
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,Looks like they got fresh horses.
411,4,6,14,24,1.5833333333333333,0.15830472663009768,514,I'm glad we ditched the wagon.
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,"Quick Billy, the Sheriff is on a Fisher Price!"
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,They've been on my trail for over forty years now.
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,"Back off, sheriff. I've got a cap pistol and I ain't afraid to use it."
411,3,8,13,24,1.5833333333333333,0.14641447355925183,514,This is getting really boring. What do you say to a quick shoot-out?
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,I told you to grab the ones with wheels.
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,Do you think they want us to pull over?
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,"Just get to the barn, there's a coin operated helicopter waiting for us there!"
447,6,3,17,26,1.5769230769230769,0.16800253590647346,514,I knew that piggy bank would be trouble.
447,5,5,16,26,1.5769230769230769,0.1585809856006792,514,They're gaining on us ... now they're not ... now they are ...
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,"I keep going back and forth on this bank robbery thing, Clem. I just can't see us stayin' ahead of the law forever."
447,4,7,15,26,1.5769230769230769,0.14856313781406125,514,Saddle class is the new spin class.
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,This is starting to feel like a Mel Brooks movie!
447,2,11,13,26,1.5769230769230769,0.12616322666812863,514,"The guns are fake too, right?"
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,"Hurry, their imaginations are gaining on us!"
447,2,11,13,26,1.5769230769230769,0.12616322666812863,514,It's the darnedest thing-- they're actually gaining on us!
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,Just not the same since PETA got involved.
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,"Well, at least they're not gaining on us."
447,4,7,15,26,1.5769230769230769,0.14856313781406125,514,"Hey, I'm Billy the Kid! What's your excuse?"
447,5,5,16,26,1.5769230769230769,0.1585809856006792,514,I told you this was a low budget movie
447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,We're not gonna lose 'em if we keep going back and forth down this road!
447,4,7,15,26,1.5769230769230769,0.14856313781406125,514,If we gave up now we'd be off our rockers.
447,2,11,13,26,1.5769230769230769,0.12616322666812863,514,You have no chance of catching us before the statute of limitations runs out.
447,4,7,15,26,1.5769230769230769,0.14856313781406125,514,"Hey, it’s Zeno’s Paradox all over again!"

447,3,9,14,26,1.5769230769230769,0.13781902205514548,514,We should have just walked away when we had the chance.

447,4,7,15,26,1.5769230769230769,0.14856313781406125,514,I guess they just blue screen the real action in after...

696,1,9,12,22,1.5,0.12741179785940637,514,at least no animals have been hurt in the making of our little drama.

696,1,10,13,24,1.5,0.1203858530857692,514,And they said crime doesn't play.
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,We're in trouble. They have newer models.
696,2,6,12,20,1.5,0.15389675281277312,514,Let's just settle this in a manly way.Squirt guns at ten paces.
696,3,6,15,24,1.5,0.14744195615489714,514,We're changing horses in the next town.
696,1,11,14,26,1.5,0.11435437497937312,514,The key is to let the horse do the work.
696,3,6,15,24,1.5,0.14744195615489714,514,"No time-out chair can hold me, sheriff."
696,2,8,14,24,1.5,0.13459547551454137,514,Who are these guys? Three days now and they're still keeping up with us.
696,1,10,13,24,1.5,0.1203858530857692,514,Do not confuse motion and progress sheriff.
696,1,10,13,24,1.5,0.1203858530857692,514,"Sheriff, these new models are all giddy up and no go!"
696,1,10,13,24,1.5,0.1203858530857692,514,"If we gain another 6 inches on them by nightfall, I think we can lose 'em."

696,3,6,15,24,1.5,0.14744195615489714,514,"Damn it, Gary, they're closing in on us! Can't you make 'clip-clop' sounds any faster?"
696,1,11,14,26,1.5,0.11435437497937312,514,Faster! We're almost at the Merry Go Round!
696,3,6,15,24,1.5,0.14744195615489714,514,Actually; they're not gaining at all.
696,0,12,12,24,1.5,0.10425720702853739,514,"Great, now they'll get us for speeding too"
696,4,5,17,26,1.5,0.14935759876113539,514,Hurry we can lose them in the rockies!
696,4,5,17,26,1.5,0.14935759876113539,514,Keeping up this whole 'Billie the Kid' persona is getting to be a bit much.
696,4,5,17,26,1.5,0.14935759876113539,514,They're reaching for their cap guns!
696,3,6,15,24,1.5,0.14744195615489714,514,"Man, it's two feet forward, two feet back--we'll never catch these guys!"
696,4,4,16,24,1.5,0.15925551431765153,514,Those animal rights folks have gone too far this time.
696,0,13,13,26,1.5,0.1,514,"Rock faster, I think they're starting to fall asleep."
696,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,514,You just playin' with us?
696,5,3,18,26,1.5,0.1593255013631383,514,Those animal-rights activists have really slowed us down.
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,"If you think you can catch me sheriff, you're off your rocker."
696,4,5,17,26,1.5,0.14935759876113539,514,"I don't care if we have a zero carbon footprint, damn it! They're getting away!"
696,3,6,15,24,1.5,0.14744195615489714,514,"We haven't lost them, but they're not gaining any ground either."
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,"I know it's been three hours, but I think we're starting to lose 'em."
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,I don't think I'll ever get used to these new zero emission horses.
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,Stop or you'll shoot? You know damn well we all got our guns the same place as these horses!
696,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,514,Shouldn't have trusted the Kid for our getaway horses.
696,2,8,14,24,1.5,0.13459547551454137,514,I thought you said they were off their rockers?
696,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,514,Hi Partner. Welcome to Perdition.
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,"Are you absolutely sure the script said ""based on a true story?"""
696,2,8,14,24,1.5,0.13459547551454137,514,How the west was fun.
696,2,7,13,22,1.5,0.14339724740304663,514,I told you being a cowboy isn't a hobby!
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,I knew we shouldn't have robbed that daycare.
696,3,7,16,26,1.5,0.1386750490563073,514,"Slim, I think I'm gettin' too old to be robbing piggy banks!"
696,2,8,14,24,1.5,0.13459547551454137,514,When will you varmints understand Zeno's paradoxes?
696,2,9,15,26,1.5,0.1270977818604485,514,"Keep going, their horses are getting tired."
696,1,11,14,26,1.5,0.11435437497937312,514,"When the application said 'Rocking Horse Ranch,' I thought they were talking about the brand."
696,2,8,14,24,1.5,0.13459547551454137,514,It's OK their guns are not real either.
696,3,6,15,24,1.5,0.14744195615489714,514,Quick! Release the termites!
696,4,4,16,24,1.5,0.15925551431765153,514,If you can just get off your high hobby horse and listen for once...

795,3,7,17,27,1.4814814814814814,0.1347189791172295,514,Lucky we got that 10 hour head start.
795,3,7,17,27,1.4814814814814814,0.1347189791172295,514,Let's try to get a few more inches between us before sundown.
795,2,9,16,27,1.4814814814814814,0.12369397918001374,514,Ok. I admit it. I stole some wooden nickels.
795,4,5,18,27,1.4814814814814814,0.14490757807441046,514,"Trust me pardner, chafing is only half of our problem."
795,3,7,17,27,1.4814814814814814,0.1347189791172295,514,Ha! You guys should know you look ridiculous.

795,4,5,18,27,1.4814814814814814,0.14490757807441046,514,Split up!
795,5,3,19,27,1.4814814814814814,0.15442541575917554,514,Ditch the evidence!
795,4,5,18,27,1.4814814814814814,0.14490757807441046,514,I think we're losing them.
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,If they get any closer we'll have to make a run for it.
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,How many quarters did you say you have?
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Let me repeat... this is just a hobby.
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,I was only pretending!
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,I would have enjoyed this more when I was eight years old!
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,"When they said he was a young Director, I guess they meant it."
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,"Don't know 'bout you, Sheriff, but this is the second-saddest horse chase I've ever been in."
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,"We will, We will Rock You."
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,"I don't know about you guys, but I'm definitely firing my agent."
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,You are lucky I can't shoot while holding on to my hat.
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,How the hell do you keep gaining on us?
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,"I realize it's a low-budget Western, but couldn't they have skimped on wardrobe instead?"
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,"Billy, you really are a kid."
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,I think we can outrock them.
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,We'll get fresh horses when we get to the merry-go-roundup!
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Rock harder Rufus....they're gainin' on us!
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,"This is just a hobby, right?"
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,"For you, it's just a hobby."
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,What are the odds that their horses are just as fast as our horses?
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,I never thought a life of crime would lead to such incredibile chaffing.
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,Doggone budget movies!
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,"Hey Sheriff, how 'bout we call it a draw?"
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,This was more fun when we were kids.
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Hey! I shot you! No fair! Mom!
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,Don't you know there's a law against tailgating!
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,The studio insisted upon a kid’s movie.
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,Tort law has really ruined fantasy cowboy camp.
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,I reckon the Pinkertons got the same carpenter.
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,No way is your horsey going to beat my horsey!
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Dang! We shoulda stole the Hot Wheels.
804,1,10,14,25,1.48,0.11718930554164632,514,"""Any closer and I'll get out my squirt gun""."
804,5,2,18,25,1.48,0.1645195023900409,514,"They're gaining us! ...Nevermind, we're losing them. Here they come again! ...Okay, we're pulling away. They're catching up!"
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,How about we call a truce and break for naptime?
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Quick! I think we're gaining on them!
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,"They're still there, but they haven't gained on us."
804,1,10,14,25,1.48,0.11718930554164632,514,It's almost sundown and we still haven't left!
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,Giddy Up? You try Giddying Up.
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Be on the lookout for Indians. They have real horses.
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,"Good work, fellas - my pedometer shows we've covered twenty-two miles since sunrise."
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,Rock faster--those ain't toy guns.
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,I think we better make a run for it!
804,1,10,14,25,1.48,0.11718930554164632,514,"Better use yer spurs, Clem. The posse's almost in squirt-gun range!"
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Head for the toy store! We can lose them there!
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,We don't want to play with you guys anymore!
804,5,2,18,25,1.48,0.1645195023900409,514,Do they really have to do *everything* in post-production?
804,5,2,18,25,1.48,0.1645195023900409,514,"I'll tell ya one thing, Sheriff! You ain't sending me back to timeout!"
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,Bein' an outlaw just ain't the same since the west went carbon neutral.

804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,Damn these low emission vehicles!
804,4,4,17,25,1.48,0.1540562667772179,514,Dang! they got 'em too...
804,3,6,16,25,1.48,0.14282856857085702,514,"I dunno about you, Clyde, but I'm hankerin' fer a juice box."
804,2,8,15,25,1.48,0.13063945294843618,514,. . . and they wonder why they call me Billy the Kid!

1263,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,give it up….. you'll never catch us……….
1263,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,I don't care how energy efficient they are!
1263,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Is horseplay illegal?
1263,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,These new eco-friendly rides don't really have the giddy-up I was hoping for.
1263,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Why don't we settle this like men? With popguns.
1263,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,But in my dream we got away.
1263,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,"Grow up? I will when you do, Sheriff!"
1263,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,The programing of this virtual reality needs work.
1263,0,10,15,25,1.4,0.1,514,We'll never catch those wooden Indians at this rate.
1263,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,You give up first.
1263,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,Don't kid yourself. You've been chasing us for 40 years.
1263,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,"Give it up, Sheriff, this horse is made from lightweight, kiln dried real Western pine. You're on an old oak."
1263,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,Everyone stop where you are. It's time for a nap.
1263,3,4,18,25,1.4,0.1414213562373095,514,Th-they're ga-ga-gaining on us.
1263,1,8,16,25,1.4,0.11547005383792516,514,It's been hell ever since the real horses went on strike!
1263,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Sheriff, you can go to hell - you and the horse you rode in on!"
1263,2,6,17,25,1.4,0.12909944487358055,514,"Told ya, Mahogany better than Spruce any day"
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,Next time I'm the horse thief and you're the accomplice.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,We've done this since kindergarten. Let's switch sides.
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,We ain't goin back to yer Micky Mouse jailhouse sheriff...
1342,0,9,14,23,1.391304347826087,0.10405096111532161,514,What are the chances they are carrying toy pop guns?
1342,4,1,18,23,1.391304347826087,0.16320808554990182,514,Why do you keep calling me OJ? This isn't a white bronco!
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,Dang hybrids! They ain't near as good as our old hay-guzzlers!
1342,0,9,14,23,1.391304347826087,0.10405096111532161,514,You'll never catch us once we hit the Rocky Mountains!
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,They're heading for the Mexican playground.
1342,3,3,17,23,1.391304347826087,0.15061311370164152,514,You'll never catch us. We rock AND roll!
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,Just great! The Earps are closing fast AND our horses have termites.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"If you show me what's under your hat, I'll show you what's under mine."
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,Hold on to your hats; it's going to be a bumpy night.
1342,0,9,14,23,1.391304347826087,0.10405096111532161,514,Just keep ridin' pardner...they'll never catch us!
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,So much for zero emissions!
1342,3,3,17,23,1.391304347826087,0.15061311370164152,514,Half ass is better than no ass.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,Let's split off and see if we can lose them.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,I told you they were nags.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,Stop tailgating!
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,The breeder stiffed us.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,You're off your rocker if you think you're going to do anything but eat my sawdust.
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,Vegan westerns never seem to go anywhere.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"No, holding on to the RIGHT side makes you go faster."
1342,0,9,14,23,1.391304347826087,0.10405096111532161,514,Let's get back to the birthday party.
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,"Goldarnit, they've gained another inch on us!"
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"What's worse, getting caught or having a splinter in my ass?"
1342,3,3,17,23,1.391304347826087,0.15061311370164152,514,Give us a break. It was just a bag of wooden nickels!
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,They’re gaining and also receding on us!
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"Third place again, Senator Rubio."
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,Which one of you brought the juice boxes?
1342,3,3,17,23,1.391304347826087,0.15061311370164152,514,Wait - Billy's NOT a kid?
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"Sheriff, if you get off your hobby horse, I'll get off mine."
1342,0,9,14,23,1.391304347826087,0.10405096111532161,514,"Don't worry, they've only got toy guns."
1342,3,3,17,23,1.391304347826087,0.15061311370164152,514,Only thing that's gonna give them the slip is fresh horses!
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,We'll make our getaway when they have nap time.
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"I reckon we're lookin' at a long time out, Mikey."
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,We'll fix it in post.
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,I think we lost them!
1342,3,3,17,23,1.391304347826087,0.15061311370164152,514,"Slim, this is the last time you buy a getaway horse from Donald Trump."
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,Who would've thought that they'd stake out the playroom?!
1342,1,7,15,23,1.391304347826087,0.12156961659470118,514,That's the last time we hit Toytown!
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"Sheriff, get off your high horse cause we ain't no bank rockers!!"
1342,3,3,17,23,1.391304347826087,0.15061311370164152,514,What is it about white Broncos?!
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"Besides, by definition, an actual robbery can't be of play money."
1342,2,5,16,23,1.391304347826087,0.13686395014372163,514,"Hey, buddy! Is this your anxiety dream, or mine?"
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"Let's split up, they're gaining on us."
1386,1,8,17,26,1.3846153846153846,0.11200169060431567,514,We should've robbed a car dealer instead of a toy store.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,Hurry up! We'll be late for our PETA meeting!
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,I thought we would have lost these guys by now!
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,"They've got the speed, but we've got the brains."
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,You'd think after thirty years they'd realize they ain't catching us.
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,"If we ride through nap time, we may be able to lose them at the jungle gym."
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,"Dang it, Luke! I said ""Walking Horses""!"
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,"If they get any closer, then I'm calling my mom"
1386,1,8,17,26,1.3846153846153846,0.11200169060431567,514,Better put the cork in your gun.
1386,0,10,16,26,1.3846153846153846,0.09730085108210397,514,"But, glass half-full; we're definitely not getting caught either."
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"Bang! Bang, bang! Bang!"
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,I told you we shouldn't have stolen their horses.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"If you get a splinter in your ass, I'm not pulling it out."
1386,0,10,16,26,1.3846153846153846,0.09730085108210397,514,"They're gaining! No, they're not. They're gaining! No, they're not."
1386,0,10,16,26,1.3846153846153846,0.09730085108210397,514,Rock on! Rock on! I guess I should have shot the sheriff AND the deputy.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,This is boring. Let's cut a deal.
1386,1,8,17,26,1.3846153846153846,0.11200169060431567,514,We'll lose them at Nursery Pass.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,I wonder what the Rocking Horse elite will do now that this is still a four-man race.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"Posse's gainin', but we'll outrun 'em. There's a fresh seesaw waitin' at the pass."
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,Mom says we have to be home in time for dinner.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"Good call, Sheriff-- these are a lot faster than the merry-go-round horses."
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"Faster, they're gaining on us."
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,You're as inadequate as you were yesterday on the merry-go-round.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,I reckon we have a week's headstart.
1386,0,10,16,26,1.3846153846153846,0.09730085108210397,514,"We will, we will out-rock you!"
1386,1,8,17,26,1.3846153846153846,0.11200169060431567,514,We need more horsepower!
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,"You and your brilliant ""cheap dude ranch"" idea!"
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"It was just a toy store, sheriff!"
1386,1,8,17,26,1.3846153846153846,0.11200169060431567,514,Last time I'm rustling a toy shop.
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,My gun's out of caps. I surrender!
1386,0,10,16,26,1.3846153846153846,0.09730085108210397,514,"I try to be as tolerant as the next feller, but this is takin' animal rights too far!"
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,It's better for your core!
1386,1,8,17,26,1.3846153846153846,0.11200169060431567,514,Lucky us - it's almost their time for milk and cookies.
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,"Hey, Rex, my GPS is indicating we haven't moved a bit."
1386,1,8,17,26,1.3846153846153846,0.11200169060431567,514,"Yeah, we saw them. They went thataway, thisaway, thataway, thisaway ..."
1386,2,6,18,26,1.3846153846153846,0.12498520622516862,514,That'll teach me not to rob FAO Schwartz!
1386,3,4,19,26,1.3846153846153846,0.136741452574086,514,I need a new agent.
1424,2,4,15,21,1.380952380952381,0.14599723539767515,514,I'd feel better if they had the 'Rawhide' theme playing in the background.
1424,3,2,16,21,1.380952380952381,0.16148404721726828,514,"I know, but you know how PETA can be."
1424,1,6,14,21,1.380952380952381,0.12865958177244088,514,"Rock faster, Barney! These spurs ain't doin' us no good."
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,Reckon we've invented the low-speed bronco chase.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,"Well shoot, I'm outta caps!"
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,I'm out of dimes.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,C'mon! I know you're using your feet!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,I knew this O.K. Corral reenactment camp sounded too good for the price.
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,They were only wooden nickels!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Is it the whiskey talking or did we steal the wrong horses?
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,You have to call a time-out. Then we can trade hats.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Believe!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Back off or I'll sic my toy poodle on you!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"According to quantum physics, I could theoretically reach you in one billion billion billion years."
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,Not so fast!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,GOP Establishment falling behind.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,This is my first PETA authorized posse.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,Somehow it don't seem so wild anymore.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"Hey, Walt, he referred to my hat size! I guarantee there's no problem. I guarantee it!"
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"The kinder, gentler, not-so-Wild West, circa 2016..."
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,They told me you're all hat and no cowboy.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,See what happens when you get government-issued horses?
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,"Sheriff, do you see this as something more than a hobby?"
1427,0,9,15,24,1.375,0.10094660663590603,514,"Man, you ROCK!"
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,You know what really chaps my hide? Splinters.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,They're gaining on us! Let's see if we can lose them in the jungle gym.
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,We did not steal your strollers!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,The Duke must be looking down and laughing at us.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Do you think your mom will let you sleep over tonight?
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"Faster, Jeb! I don't want to end up sittin' in the corner!"
1427,0,9,15,24,1.375,0.10094660663590603,514,"Wait, they can afford to CG in the horses and they can't afford to pay us scale?"
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,"You were right. This bank robbin' business is child's play, Nate!"
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,It must be snack time by now.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Looks like the posse picked up fresh horses at the lumberyard.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,I think they're fixin' to head us off at the past!
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,This isn't what I had in mind when I suggested wild west reenactments as a hobby.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Dang ASPCA...
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Eat my splinters.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,If we go down we're going down low carbon footprint style
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,I just love the thrill of the chase.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,You got a loaner from the blacksmith too?
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,Faster!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,This is getting us nowhere!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"Hurry up, Bart, they're gaining on us!"
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,Get off your high horse
1427,4,1,19,24,1.375,0.15710815069401318,514,"Quick, get out the Lincoln Logs and build a wall. And make them pay for it."
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,"Don't shoot -- the bullets are fake, too."
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,Stay back! My squirt gun is loaded!
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,Stop copying me!
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,This is what you get when millennials plan a company retreat.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,Are you sure Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids began this way?
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,No animals were harmed in the making of this movie.
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,"Look on the bright side boys, no stalls to clean anymore!"
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,I told the sheriff he should take up a hobby!
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,Face it! You'll NEVER catch us!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,30 minutes and we still haven't reached the front yard!
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,He's gainin' on us! They don't call him Hard Rocker for nuthin!
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,I'm guessing the posse's still a day or two behind us.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"Watch out, boys! This sheriff's off his rocker."
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,All we was doin' was rockin' and a-boppin' and singin' a song.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"Yeah, Jake, they rock, but please stop saying that."
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,How are they gaining on us?
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,Best kindergarten reunion ever!!!
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,I don't think this simulation is very instructive.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Think we're dumb? We know you just have cap guns.
1427,1,7,16,24,1.375,0.11753044625585937,514,I think we should splinter up.
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"Get a move on, pard'ner. We only got a day's head start on 'em!"
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,Shouldn't we all be going after the farrier?!
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,Okay Frank. Maybe you're not the world's worst judge of horseflesh.
1427,3,3,18,24,1.375,0.14511989046542054,514,"They be gainin' on us, Zeke."
1427,2,5,17,24,1.375,0.1320476966966806,514,"Dang it boys, I say it's time we learn to ride REAL horses."

1495,2,6,19,27,1.3703703703703705,0.1211077567340871,514,We'll try to cut them off at the pass! You go to the stable and shoot the guy who sold us these!
1495,1,8,18,27,1.3703703703703705,0.10871102010449524,514,Hurry! We can lose them in the ball pit canyon.
1495,1,8,18,27,1.3703703703703705,0.10871102010449524,514,"Jake, we're being followed!...but, they'll never catch us."
1495,3,4,20,27,1.3703703703703705,0.13234837207221578,514,Now I see why the sheriff's nickname is Rocky!
