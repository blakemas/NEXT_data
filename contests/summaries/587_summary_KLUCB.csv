3468,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"As a Madonna and Child, it's utterly derivative work."
3126,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,It just feels reductive.
3122,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"This is a warning? Yeah, maybe not to eat so many acorns."

3100,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,But it's not singed.
3097,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,His early work is doe-rivative.

2955,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I dunno ... I think it fails to evoke much emotion
2937,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Too iterative
2921,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,"Now, this one is very deer."

3355,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,It's called hop skip and a jump.
3353,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,It's a warning about deer's fragility.
3333,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,The lighting is very dark but once they add the headlights it's captivating!
3330,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,The lack of detail is a little disappointing.
3318,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,Hate it. But... I'm frozen in those headlights above us.

3230,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,They grow up much too quickly.

3224,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,This was taken right after Dad left her for another woman.
3215,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I saw one just like this in my neighborhood the last time I crossed the street!
3191,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I still say Bobby could have made this.
4324,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"Compared to this one, the other works seem so stag-nant."

3271,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"Actually, I prefer to yield to art."
4342,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,This makes us look so conventional.
4598,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,"Personally, I find them very derivative."
4375,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"It's kind, all right, but it lacks a certain umph!"
5399,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,I just love the intimacy of this family portrait.
5375,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,...and this is my favorite. See how he is boldly addressing his male gaze origins...?
5373,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,So stereotypical...
5369,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I prefer Monet.
5341,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I think it represents a cautionary expression for the rut in our existence
5322,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I always found his symbolism disturbing.
5315,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Nothing is more beautiful than the female body!
5313,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Well it's . . . different.
5308,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"Derivative, but a good likeness."
5283,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,She always had a nice figure.
5270,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Note the composition! The colors...
5237,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,It’s idealized.
5224,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"When it comes to this form of art, buyer beware!"

5187,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I painted this in reminiscence of my first dinner out.
5180,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,Realism! Like a deer in the headlights.
5174,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,Let's talk.
5152,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,"Young Buck, my deer, to me, this is simply a matter of does and don'ts..."
5122,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"No, I don't think it makes you look fat."
5118,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,Her painting upends art's white-male hit parade.
5108,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I've always been more of a dadaist than a mamaist...
5100,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"The original's been sold, we'll have to settle for a giclee."
5092,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,None of these horns look right to me.
5406,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,These signs are to deer as a trailer park is to tornados: They seem to invite disaster.
5412,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,It speaks to me in a primal way.
5423,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,"Oh deer, we'll get a few bucks of doe for this show"
5460,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Don't you find Pop Art appallingly derivative?
5554,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,Yeah. But you didn't.
5559,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"An excellent postmodern rendering, addressing the tragedy of fawn crossings"
5583,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"Deer, I herd the this show is stagnant. Don't fawn over it, whatever you doe."
5593,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I prefer his abstract period

5639,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,Eh...formula art—the artist sees us as all looking alike.
2821,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,His Yellow Period was quite dry.
5649,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I think I’m gonna have diarrhea
5654,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,"""What about me""?"
5662,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,My two point buck could draw this.
5667,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,It's so relatable.
5062,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,This is ... US!
5673,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,The use of silhouette doesn't say much for technique.
5699,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,It's been crossing my mind lately that we should not let Junior stray on his own.
5704,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,What exactly is a semiotics focus group?
5761,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,But his work is so derivative.
5786,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Sublime renderings of female form but he's even more interesting as a colorist!
5820,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Are you a fan of the still life?
5841,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,"I don't get it, do you?"
5845,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,I was free. Then I wasn't. Now I'm free again!
5549,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,This is too old school for my tastes. Give me something that pops!
5547,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,The originality in this artwork is simply brilliant
5540,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,I wonder if it gets your best side deer ?
5529,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I prefer his red and green period
5694,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Who would expect these invitations to our stag parties to become art?
5056,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I liked the scale of his roadside work better.
5055,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,The headstones of our ancestors

4627,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,Those damn headlights.
4617,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,That's what happens when you cross the street without looking.
4603,3944,0,4,36,40,1.1,0.04803844614152615,587,I find The Reflective period rather pedestrian
4595,3944,1,2,37,40,1.1,0.05991446895152781,587,And this one here is an example of what not to do on the road.
