1265,2,13,50,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06308161333406433,585,"Sorry, I burnt the pop tart you wanted. It's my first day. How about a free wish?"
1265,3,11,51,65,1.2615384615384615,0.06678367443917438,585,Actually it's quite roomy for Manhattan standards.
1265,4,9,52,65,1.2615384615384615,0.07029102647114255,585,Rub the lamp or I'm toast.

1418,3,10,49,62,1.2580645161290323,0.06874059282197471,585,Of course I left. You don't rub me anymore.
1418,1,14,47,62,1.2580645161290323,0.06056094155453091,585,"Just to be clear, was that toasted bagel wish supposed to be part of your inner monologue?"
1418,1,14,47,62,1.2580645161290323,0.06056094155453091,585,"I now offer wishes with the additional options of light, bagel, and extra crispy."

1476,3,11,52,66,1.2575757575757576,0.06588329747412035,585,"Anyway, after I got priced out of the lamp, I tried the coffee maker, but My Doctor told me to cut back on caffeine...but I really like the neighborhood so here I am"

1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,Are heating and electric included?
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,I grant thee two magnificent slices of lightly browned rye.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,Sublet the old one. This one has heat included and a pool within wafting distance.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,No need; the power has been restored.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Yes, I would love some tea."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Careful. You have a bagel setting and two more.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,I'm sorry there's nothing I can do about that pop-tart

1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Better health care.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Before we do this, could I get an espresso?"

1482,0,15,45,60,1.25,0.05637345210021216,585,"Way back when, I got a scholarship to NYU, and now I can't resist bagels."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Mom says that I can't grant any wishes until you clean out the crumb tray.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Man, am I glad your back with my repaired lamp. In 5 days absolutely no one has rubbed this toaster!"
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,I prefer a dry heat.
1482,1,11,40,52,1.25,0.06656289057129833,585,"Lamp, toaster, ... no difference, they're all connected now."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"So, you were expecting toast???"
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"I can't bring people back form the dead, make them fall in love, or make your toast not slightly burnt."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Most guys would ask for a billion dollars, so it's kind of refreshing to grant a wish to clean out the toaster."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"I've told you before, rub twice for coffee."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Lamp Genie had to go out of town on business. I’m taking his messages.
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,"Well, I wish you would clean out the crumb tray every once in a while."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,Next time can you rub the coffee maker? I haven't had a cup in over a century.
1482,0,15,45,60,1.25,0.05637345210021216,585,"If you think this is weird, you should see the coffee genie."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Okay, all the gross crumbs are gone. What's your second wish?"
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,You may have anything you wish...light...medium....or dark.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,It's a better location and the heat's included in the rent
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,Do not say avocado toast.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Beware, the toaster oven is a Pandora's box."""
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,The bottle was occupied.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Your wish is my command! As long as it's light, medium or dark."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Sorry, small change in venue. You have three wishes that somehow include toast or toastiness."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"So, it's a deal. You let me live in the coffee maker and I'll work things out with your babysitter."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,Perfect coffee. Your next two wishes?
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"OK, so I popped out of the toaster. Two wishes left."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,Now go rub all of the dishes in the sink.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Okay, the toaster's fixed. What's your next wish?"
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"""You're telling me your first wish was for a Keurig""?"
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Dude, I just want toast."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Word of advice, be careful of what comes out of the coffee pot when you rub it"
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,I'm going to give you a Mulligan since you are new at this. Think bigger than a Pop Tart as one of your three wishes.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,I had to move out of the lamp - the rent was too high.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,I found it a lot warmer than that cold metal lamp.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,This is my winter home.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Kid, that's a pretty tall order for a genie who hasn't even had his first cup of coffee yet. You do know Ivanka's married, right?"
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,Your sauna's broken.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"The lamp only gave me a small spark, while I get really charged up from the toaster."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Crumbs are all out. What's your second wish?
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"White, rye or pumpernickel?"
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Hang on, I gotta warm up for a minute."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Thank God! It was getting a little toasty in there.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,I was just working on my tan.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"I upgraded, kid. Finally have free roaming."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,You did wish for a hot date with Genie.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Apparently, you couldn’t put the genie back in the bottle."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Sorry, pal. I know you freed me and all, but 'unlimited pumpkin spice coffee creamer' is where I draw the line."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,You sure you want to use your last wish on Pop-Tarts?
1482,0,15,45,60,1.25,0.05637345210021216,585,"Yeah, trying a fourth wish means you're toast."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,And will that be regular or decaf?
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,I was sold on its' pop up feature.
1482,2,12,50,64,1.25,0.06299407883487121,585,"No, you can't but me back in the bottle."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Before I sign on this new place, is heat included?"
1482,5,5,50,60,1.25,0.07747789916329083,585,"I'd love to turn him back into a reality show host, but you already used your third one on ""I wish there was a clown in the Office"""
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,I am a free range genie. The lamp was too confining.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,Try 'open robusta'
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Look kid, no wishes OR toast before I've had my coffee..."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Thanks for letting me warm up in the toaster, you wouldn't believe how cold it gets in that lamp."
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,This makes it easier to just pop up
1482,4,5,43,52,1.25,0.08181113518415854,585,"Is it too late for last week's contest? I only got my magazine yesterday! I wanted to submit a caption for the lady on the phone with all the men standing about, ""I need to report the 3-D printer not working right again."""
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,I wished for the coffee genie.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Sorry. I just moved into this new two-room apartment.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Hey, it beats a Pop Tart."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,The lamp just seemed dated.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Hi, I'm Ali. My brother""s on night shift."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,I fixed your toaster. That's wish #1.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"If he ever comes out, tell him that toaster genie's looking for him"
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Pumpernickel, rye, or whole wheat?"
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,I've redirected my traffic to the toaster.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"If you're surprised to see me, wait until you see the family living in the coffee maker."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Young man, when I was your age, I was the toast of the town."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Please don't take me back to Walmart.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Due to our austerity program, the genie of the lamp was let go, and you only get two wishes."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,Put that damn thing down before you hurt sombody!
1482,5,5,50,60,1.25,0.07747789916329083,585,"What can I say, the lamp gets cold this time of year."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Whats it going to be, immortality or avocado toast?"
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,My wish is that you empty the crumb tray!
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,The guy in the coffee maker? He's crazy.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,no I wished for bikini models by the dozen. Not a genie in a toaster oven.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,So. I'm the substitute. What's your wish?
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Wrong lamp--you wanted decaf genie.
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,"Lamp, toaster... anything beats being a diaper genie."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,Try rubbing the oven
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,It's a dry heat - arthritis runs in the family.
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,Alexa sent me.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,“rub that thing one more time and you’re toast”…
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Three wishes: white, rye, or whole wheat!"
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"Rub the lamp all you want. I'm telling you, in winter, rub the toaster."
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,Nobody wanted you know this...
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"This is my winter home, it's much more toasty in here."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"They call it ""the internet of things""."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,You can have four wishes as long as one of them is a cup of coffee for me.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Really? Leg go your Eggo?
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Hey, genies get old too...I've moved to a warmer climate."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Hey, you rub it ten times--I come out of your butt."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,I wish you weren't a stereotype.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,My lamp got hacked. Moved to the cloud and channel through toaster.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"I know, I said I preferred it toasty warm, but I didn't mean it literally..."
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"So, a properly toasted bagel is in your top three?"
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Believe it or not, the rent is way cheaper."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,It's because you rub me the wrong way.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"Dude, this isn’t Aladdin, I’m not granting you sh**."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,What? I was hungry.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,So many kids were asking for Pop Tarts that I just come out of the toaster now.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"First, make the coffee."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,OK roaches gone. You get two more.
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"The lamp’s Wi-Fi is down, so lucky you have a smart toaster."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,I am NOT toast
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"The rent is cheaper, and the heat's better. But can you wish me a vacuum?"
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Yeah, I'm trying to stay with the times. Thinking of moving up to the juice extractor next."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,Now put that lamp away. It's not a toy.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,Forget that. My sister's in the blender.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Listen kid, if all you want are pop tarts, just go to the supermarket."
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,Cleaning the crumbs out of the toaster? I do wishes not miracles.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"You still have 3 wishes, they just have to be breakfast-related"
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Now I am the genie of the toaster, your wishes come with a one year manufacturer's warranty."
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,"Hey, you said to pop up. Two more to go."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Just to be clear, your wish is that I turn into cotton-candy flavored pop-tarts?"
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,What? It's my summer home.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,I'll grant you three bagels.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,Got any coffee? Long day.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,"I know you're upset you only get 3 wishes, but saying ""this genie is toast"" was uncalled for."
1482,2,11,47,60,1.25,0.06563466770327837,585,"When the lamp genii defeated me he said: You're toast! If you want him, try the coffee pot."
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,I've found a flat with more room.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,If you want room for cream that's gonna count as another wish.
1482,4,7,49,60,1.25,0.07374180027192605,585,You think I was just going to stay in there and wait for you to rub?
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,No number of wishes guarantees that your toast won't be burnt.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,"Sorry kid, I've been electric only since Newport '65."
1482,0,15,45,60,1.25,0.05637345210021216,585,But first coffee.
1482,3,9,48,60,1.25,0.06980602664478336,585,Anything about girls - talk to the guy in the microwave.
1482,1,13,46,60,1.25,0.061179554208144936,585,Mr Coffee could use a cleaning too.

2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,I moved to a two bedroom with heat included.
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"First of all, I wished it for myself. And that's not what I meant by toasted."
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,No can do- I've been gluten free for a million years.
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"Ok if I crash in the toaster for a few days? I don't know who the last genie was, but he left the lamp a total mess."
2104,0,11,40,51,1.2156862745098038,0.058166262643887544,585,Lamps are so old turban.

2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,The lamp? I think not! You have your wishes; I have mine. I'm thinking an espresso machine would be nice.

2104,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,585,"What are you, an old man? It's all automatic now..."
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"I only serve Toastmasters; to find another genie, unplug the toaster."
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"Master, you have three wishes to chose from: light toast, dark toast, or coffee."
2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,"Based on appearances, your toast is in that bottle."
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"If you wish for me to cool off in the fridge, you will still have two more wishes."
2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,I was in the fridge 'till they hiked the rent.
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,What?! I was ready for something more modern?

2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,It's not worth fixing. Get a new one.
2104,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,585,"Ya get three wishes, Shorty, but make it snappy, my butt's on fire."

2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,That kid that was bullying you at school? He's toast!
2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,"I went from your antique lamp to this old automatic drip brewer but then one morning I ""woke up and smelled the coffee""."
2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,I personally enjoy the smell of toast more.
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"No thanks, I'm a beer man myself."

2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,I've updated with technology! I need to be charged!

2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,"No, this is way better. The most difficult wish I've had to deal with so far is not burning Jerry in Accounting's pop tart."
2104,3,5,43,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07573807025814888,585,"With everyone going gluten-free, I figured I'd be safer in here."
2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,"Ok kid, I'll take it but on wishes we're down to Reheat Defrost and Bagel."
2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"Hey kid, I wish that you'd unplug these appliances when you're not using them."
2104,0,11,40,51,1.2156862745098038,0.058166262643887544,585,I suppose you want a juicer for your third wish.
2104,0,11,40,51,1.2156862745098038,0.058166262643887544,585,I will grant you three wishes as long as the final one is to make that lamp my new home.

2104,0,11,40,51,1.2156862745098038,0.058166262643887544,585,This always happens when you use the toaster and coffee maker at the same time.
2104,0,11,40,51,1.2156862745098038,0.058166262643887544,585,"Listen, son, you can rub that lamp if you want but genies have moved on from low-tech."

2104,1,9,41,51,1.2156862745098038,0.0645571671888405,585,"Give me another. Once the pop-tart breaks, there's really nothing you can do."
2104,2,7,42,51,1.2156862745098038,0.07037003311735827,585,"Instead of rubbing the lamp, you push the toast lever. We've switched to solar."

2559,1,7,40,48,1.1875,0.06424858913372151,585,You'll find I usually pop up after a while.
2559,2,5,41,48,1.1875,0.0708124708534365,585,"Yeah, my brother does the wishes. I can help with pop quizzes."
2559,0,9,39,48,1.1875,0.05693291124629693,585,"If you were really a mensch, you'd wish for a clean toaster."

2559,0,9,39,48,1.1875,0.05693291124629693,585,"No tea, thanks, but I'll have some of that Joe with my toast."""
2559,2,5,41,48,1.1875,0.0708124708534365,585,"It is easy. A computer chip senses you rubbing the lamp, and allows me to choose the entry point."

2559,1,7,40,48,1.1875,0.06424858913372151,585,... and be careful what side you butter your bread on.
2559,1,7,40,48,1.1875,0.06424858913372151,585,Now I smell like cinnamon toast forever. I hope you're happy.

2559,2,5,41,48,1.1875,0.0708124708534365,585,It's much more toasty in here.
2559,1,7,40,48,1.1875,0.06424858913372151,585,How could any wish be better than toast?
2559,0,9,39,48,1.1875,0.05693291124629693,585,That was your third wish. I'm toast.
2559,1,7,40,48,1.1875,0.06424858913372151,585,I haven't met my neighbor Joe yet but his house always smells great.

2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,Because it's nice and toasty in there.

2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"Obviously young man, it's not a teapot."
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Because I only come with the Hamilton Beach, that's why!"

2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,I come from the bank as a prize years ago.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Sorry, it was getting stuffy in there."

2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,I'm saving a ton on rent.
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,I'm going on tour.

2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,Your wish is toast.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,Thats where I usually spend the winters.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,What now??? I'm not done with your toast yet!
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,"Alan, I was feeling trapped. You can start rubbing the toaster."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"I'm sorry, son, this is just temporary until I get a place of my own."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"My last master asked for the ""biggest tart"" to be in the toaster, and that's the last thing I remember."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,Let go my Leggo.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,What? You think I'm a mind reader too?
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,The food's better.
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,Your jam is my command.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,I'll give you a wish--I wish you would empty the blasted crumb tray once in a while!
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,And why would you ask that?
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"Oh, so you want me to go back inside?"
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,This just got creepy.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,No wishes! Lamp: cold. Small appliances: warm.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"No, I'm the genie who makes these babies work like magic."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,Oil lamps are so last Thursday.
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,"Yes, even genies like to get 'toasted' once in a while."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"sorry, but there's no wifi in the lamp..."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"Sorry, i'm off the clock."
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Sorry Billy, thought i saw Elvis in here!"
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,I'd rather be toasted than caffeinated.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,Just wish for toast.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,You forgot to plug yours in.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"OK, but this is your last chance to get it EXACTLY the way your mommy makes it."
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,Your going to have to unplug the toaster before you rub it
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,Two slices of toast coming up! Now what's your third and final wish?
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"I'm telling you, it's much warmer in the toaster."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"Sorry, I don't do windows or make coffee."
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Ok,what's your third wish?"
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Joining Toastmasters? I thought you wished for ""enoying toast, master!"""
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,"That's wishful thinking young man your only three choices are light, medium or dark"
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,I went for a shvitz.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"Sorry, I was in an airbnb for the weekend."
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"And my wish is for a cup of joe, kid."
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,What can I say? They recycled my bottle.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,Shazam! Your toast will remain hot and crispy for an hour!
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,Turns out your gluten free toast has a few wishes of its own...
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"I warned you, rub that thing one more time and I'm toast."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"The Arabian nights are great, but the Arabian morning-afters are a drag."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,The lamp doesn't have Internet access.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"That's right, two slices = two wishes"
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,I needed to recharge myself.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,Mind if I have coffee instead?
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,You didn't wanna try the coffee maker first?
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,"This isn't what I expected when I wished for a hot, new home."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"Let me guess, your third wish is for a KitchenAid Mixer?"
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,John Sylvan approves.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Coffee, cream, AND sugar?"
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,I mived out of there lasT century
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,It was past time to look for a place with central heat.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,The lamp's at the pawn shop.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"You can have the lamp, it's all about the magic toaster now."
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,I decided to move to a neighborhood with a local coffee shop.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,"To summon me, Master, now use the toaster. The heat eases my arthritis."
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,Does your mom know how hot I am?
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Anything you want, just not frozen bagels."
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,I finally got a place with central heat. And breakfast is included.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,I suggest that your wishes could be better served by wishing for a new toaster rather than wishing that I fix the old one?
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,You should probably empty the crumb tray.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"That lamp is so yesterday, kid. Electricity is where it's at."
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,Make a fourth wish and you're toast.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,Magic? No. Bluetooth.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,I don't know Kid... I've gone from cold & cramped to scorched & crumby... did they fix the heat in that lamp?
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,Do you mind! I was having some quality time with my girlfriend.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,"Light, golden or almost black, whatever you wish, I have your back."
2887,2,3,37,42,1.1666666666666667,0.07556728291396757,585,"The last guy was starvin and said, I wish you were a piece of toast!"
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,It's better. I can take the elevator to work.
2887,1,5,36,42,1.1666666666666667,0.06744608262285649,585,The youth just don't know how to wish like previous generations.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,Always unplug the toaster before you rub the lamp.
2887,0,7,35,42,1.1666666666666667,0.058202524647464865,585,This place came with heating
3109,0,8,41,49,1.163265306122449,0.05334825558285075,585,Would you settle for two wishes and a Pop-Tart?
3109,0,8,41,49,1.163265306122449,0.05334825558285075,585,"Innovation, shminnovation - give me consistency"
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,"Make your wish now, kid, or I'm toast."
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,I was thinking maybe Barbara Eden?
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,"That's your wish..? No, just make your own coffee, okay?!"
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,Sorry that sounds like a crumby deal to me.
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,It's cold in there!
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,"Dude, something's up with your wiring."
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,"Wait, you want me to make you gluten intolerant?"
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,Your wishes now come with a bagel setting option.
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,I'm tired of you just popping in.
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,I m so tired buddy.
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,Leave? This place has central heating!
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,"Now that your appliances are connected to wifi, is it ok if I upgrade my 'wishes' software?"
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,I'm sorry I'm late; I had a hot date.
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,"Sorry Buster, I'm not a video game genie, just pick a small appliance."
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,"light, medium or dark?"
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,"Well, kid. Cards on the table, is this unit subject to rent control of any kind?"
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,Hurry up or your third wish will be toast!
3111,2,3,38,43,1.1627906976744187,0.0738907079406967,585,"Dude, c'mon now. No breakfast, no wishes."
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,I said make three algorithms.
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,"For the Coffee Genie, go to the Magic Lamp App Store."
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,Regular? or Decaf?
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,You found me. Your turn to hide.
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,"Genie, I said, ""If you appear, we'll make a toast!"""
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,Let me guess. Three toaster paistries?
3111,2,3,38,43,1.1627906976744187,0.0738907079406967,585,"Since the travel ban, I'm toast"
3111,2,3,38,43,1.1627906976744187,0.0738907079406967,585,"Look, after three thousand years, I need to have a change of venue besides I refuse to be forever stereotyped."
3111,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,585,"If you ask me, a clean crumb tray is a great thing to wish for."
3111,0,7,36,43,1.1627906976744187,0.056964877739143695,585,You dialed the wrong appliance. You want the Coffee Elf.
3139,0,8,42,50,1.16,0.05237229365663817,585,"You were expecting maybe three wishes to be granted? Try buttering me up, one side only."
3140,1,5,38,44,1.1590909090909092,0.06456212749550704,585,"I've moved, but careful how you rub it kid."
3140,0,7,37,44,1.1590909090909092,0.055778005112363215,585,I like the heating in the new place.
3140,1,5,38,44,1.1590909090909092,0.06456212749550704,585,You should see what happens if you rub the lamp next to the coffee maker!

3156,0,6,33,39,1.1538461538461537,0.05852968540405249,585,"You can keep the lamp, I'm staying where it's hot. Now you can still have your three wishes, but they have to be about toast."
3156,1,4,34,39,1.1538461538461537,0.06910319629955256,585,"Electric heat is toastier than steam, but crumbier."
3156,0,6,33,39,1.1538461538461537,0.05852968540405249,585,I've upgraded my house. This one comes with sky lights and central heating.
3156,1,4,34,39,1.1538461538461537,0.06910319629955256,585,Only if you wish for toast.

3523,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,585,Sometimes you just get tired of coffee or tea!
3523,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,585,But I don’t want to go home. This other place? It gives me the warm and fuzzies.
3523,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,585,"Hey, give this toaster a polish and I'll leave you alone."
3523,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,585,Sorry-- I was hiding from that nosy internet fridge.
3523,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,585,"For your final wish, might I suggest your own appliance store?"
3523,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,585,I can't set the timer.

3523,1,4,35,40,1.15,0.0674631903431942,585,I would have come out earlier if you made some toast. Why don't you make toast!?
3523,0,6,34,40,1.15,0.057177187489686566,585,I couldn't get the melted Kraft out. Maybe wish for a mother's sympathy.
