320,9,17,47,73,1.4794520547945205,0.08301214138218192,529,I found it was just easier without the mountain.
320,9,17,47,73,1.4794520547945205,0.08301214138218192,529,And what is the basis for the doping allegations?

903,4,14,42,60,1.3666666666666667,0.07871376546591438,529,Uh-oh. My existentialism is slipping.
903,4,14,42,60,1.3666666666666667,0.07871376546591438,529,This would be so much easier if the cartoonist had drawn the ladder.
903,2,18,40,60,1.3666666666666667,0.0711752300382522,529,How will I know when I've reached the top?

903,4,14,42,60,1.3666666666666667,0.07871376546591438,529,It's a paradigm shift. I'm climbing out of the box.
903,6,10,44,60,1.3666666666666667,0.08559088956569989,529,"If a man wants to build a wall, but no one wants to build it, is it still there?"

1817,3,9,41,53,1.2830188679245282,0.0779702526476824,529,This is what happens when you make them pay for the wall.
1817,3,9,41,53,1.2830188679245282,0.0779702526476824,529,I can't afford a climbing wall.

1817,2,11,40,53,1.2830188679245282,0.07316878359661814,529,Just in case Trump is actually elected and I need to escape to Mexico.
1817,3,9,41,53,1.2830188679245282,0.0779702526476824,529,Who moved my mountain?

1817,2,11,40,53,1.2830188679245282,0.07316878359661814,529,It's still safer than flying.
1817,2,11,40,53,1.2830188679245282,0.07316878359661814,529,Virtual rock wall climbing. Who knew?
1817,3,9,41,53,1.2830188679245282,0.0779702526476824,529,It's a three-story miming wall.
1817,4,7,42,53,1.2830188679245282,0.08249272515124054,529,I expected being a 'fly on the wall' to be less stressful!

1866,4,6,40,50,1.28,0.08590455073355947,529,This is what serious social climbing looks like!
1866,3,8,39,50,1.28,0.08101398216433042,529,I think you are going too far with this mime thing.
1866,4,6,40,50,1.28,0.08590455073355947,529,"Bernie, please come down! Trump will let you in the front door --you are not Mexican or a Muslim."
1866,2,10,38,50,1.28,0.07580856663669484,529,I thought the energy drink's label was a metaphor
1866,2,10,38,50,1.28,0.07580856663669484,529,This new 'Everest' virtual reality system is astounding!
1866,2,10,38,50,1.28,0.07580856663669484,529,Trump forgot to mention that his wall was going to be invisible.
1866,3,8,39,50,1.28,0.08101398216433042,529,"I can't get grip, the air is thinner up here."
1866,2,10,38,50,1.28,0.07580856663669484,529,I told you there was a glass ceiling
1866,3,8,39,50,1.28,0.08101398216433042,529,Someone raised the bar too high.
1866,3,8,39,50,1.28,0.08101398216433042,529,Yes I'm high and no I don't use drugs.
1866,3,8,39,50,1.28,0.08101398216433042,529,This nothingness certainly feels steep.
