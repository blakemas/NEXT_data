644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,No wonder your steaks taste like leather.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,"Almost done... So, what do you serve with a subpoena?"
644,6,10,76,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05858982514448537,574,I think you're taking the term cook book the wrong way.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,I got wallets for the kids.
644,6,10,76,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05858982514448537,574,We're having male privilege tonight.

644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,"I said to make roasted beef, not roasted brief."
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,"Seriously Sue, tastes like chicken ."
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,I see you're cooking the books again dear...

644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,Aren't you taking Cooking The Books a shade too literally?
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,"What's the formula again-- three minutes per side, or 35 seconds per incriminating document?"
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,"I can’t cook the books, but I can grill ‘em"
644,2,18,72,92,1.2391304347826086,0.04977149221696988,574,"If this marinade works, tomorrow I'll do a nice pair of wingtips."
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,Cooking the books is so yesterday.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,Are you sure it feeds eight?

644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,Is this symbolic or are we really going to eat it?
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,Don't overcook it. It'll taste like leather.
644,6,10,76,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05858982514448537,574,Are you sure it'll pop open like a clam?
644,6,10,76,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05858982514448537,574,How do you know when the books are cooked?
644,2,18,72,92,1.2391304347826086,0.04977149221696988,574,Pairs well with the cabinet sauvignon.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,This is how I create a work-life balance.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,when the handle falls off it's done.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,I don't think it pairs well with this red.

644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,Interesting. I usually put my work on the back burner instead.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,"Not only did I cook the books, I gave them a dry rub."
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,I call dibs on the handle!
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,This is my last attempt to reopen this cold case.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,Let's do the Wingtips as a starter
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,I thought you said you cooked the books before you left the office
644,1,20,71,92,1.2391304347826086,0.047310779894908984,574,"Have another glass of wine, Evelyn. The shredder broke, so I'm doing it 'old school'."

644,2,18,72,92,1.2391304347826086,0.04977149221696988,574,What kind of sauce would you like on your derivative?
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,I think I'll need a bigger spatula.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,My misteak.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,Greg asked for his steak well done--I figured he wouldn't know the difference.
644,7,8,77,92,1.2391304347826086,0.06059421716385764,574,"Step 1 of Summer vacation, complete."
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,The case went cold.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,I'll show him a job well done
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,This will end the committee grilling me once and for all!
644,2,18,72,92,1.2391304347826086,0.04977149221696988,574,"What an interesting way to hold a wake for your career, dear."
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,The books are almost cooked.
644,2,18,72,92,1.2391304347826086,0.04977149221696988,574,Well I believe I am thoroughly burnt out on this job.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,I've decided to turn up the heat on this case.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,"Honey, we'll need a bigger spatula."
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,I thought I'd try grilling the books for a change.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,The doctor said it would be good for us if I put work on the back burner for a while
644,6,10,76,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05858982514448537,574,"In this case, the grilling time will be brief."

644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,Think of it as my sacrifice to the retirement gods.
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,Is this Wellington brief?
644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,I agree. Let's serve the Zinfandel instead of the Malbec.
644,3,16,73,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05211614894390474,574,I like the smoky flavor it gives my sandwiches.

644,4,14,74,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05435976935181598,574,I hate bringing work home. It seems like it never gets done.
644,5,12,75,92,1.2391304347826086,0.05651438814339231,574,I call it steak attaché.

731,3,14,70,87,1.2298850574712643,0.053483689652870973,574,Maybe I should have asked a few more questions when he told me to cook the books.

860,5,7,68,80,1.2125,0.060832177319806294,574,He never says my work is well done.
860,2,13,65,80,1.2125,0.05245175601312849,574,Boss told me that my memo was half baked.

860,5,7,68,80,1.2125,0.060832177319806294,574,"No...I'm pretty sure I told you to order Omaha steaks, not stakes in Mutual of Omaha."
860,4,9,67,80,1.2125,0.058173001480633806,574,"The trick is to cook the earnings report, but not burn the briefcase."
860,3,11,66,80,1.2125,0.05538630160123793,574,"Don't worry honey, I'll make it breif."
860,5,7,68,80,1.2125,0.060832177319806294,574,"Well, it did come off a cow."
860,2,13,65,80,1.2125,0.05245175601312849,574,You know it's done when the lock snaps open.
860,4,9,67,80,1.2125,0.058173001480633806,574,To look at it you wouldn't know it was grass-fed.
860,4,9,67,80,1.2125,0.058173001480633806,574,It's done when the bottom line isn't red.
860,1,15,64,80,1.2125,0.04934299355185322,574,I didn't cook the numbers...They're just lightly seared.

860,3,11,66,80,1.2125,0.05538630160123793,574,This explains why I only had a hamburger with me for the meeting this morning.
860,1,15,64,80,1.2125,0.04934299355185322,574,Don't know how it works but Donald said it's a tremendous way to avoid paying taxes
860,3,11,66,80,1.2125,0.05538630160123793,574,Our secrets are safe...and well done.

860,5,7,68,80,1.2125,0.060832177319806294,574,"I think I left the rib eyes at the budget meeting, so..."
860,3,11,66,80,1.2125,0.05538630160123793,574,Oh dear. This means that someone in an Uber is grilling our hamburgers.
860,3,11,66,80,1.2125,0.05538630160123793,574,What makes you think they're doing cut backs at the office?
860,2,13,65,80,1.2125,0.05245175601312849,574,I thought you said you were working on a grueling case.
860,2,13,65,80,1.2125,0.05245175601312849,574,So hard to tell if the subpoenas are done.
860,1,15,64,80,1.2125,0.04934299355185322,574,"Well, you know what they say. You are what you eat."

1472,0,10,51,61,1.1639344262295082,0.04779468766266639,574,The partners thought my last brief was overdone.
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,I don't think that is what the boss meant by cooking the books.
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,For some reason they said cook the books.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,These working vacations are getting out of control.
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,Cooking the books is one thing; barbecuing your briefcase is insane.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,For brief brisket this is taking a long time.
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,My company told me to Cook the numbers.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,How do you like your stakes?
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,That's one way to get me to stop working during family cookouts.
1472,0,10,51,61,1.1639344262295082,0.04779468766266639,574,"Darling, be careful with that health care bill grilling...the people will change from hungry to angry."
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,I think my work week and weekends are coming together at this very moment.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,Do you think red or white with it?
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,Tell me it's NOT leather... the vegans won't eat it.
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,I heard brief cooking was the all the rage
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,It's leatherette. All the rage with the vegans.
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,"Honey, I don't think your boss meant to literally cook the books."
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,Is that vegan?
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,This case just went up in flames.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,Better sharpen the knives.
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,I prefer 'well done' to 'good job'.
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,Honey... I thought you said those would be safe in the cloud...
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,"Every time we cook on this grill, the food tastes like leather."
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,This steak is like leather.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,"That ""office smell"" seems to be going away."
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,I didn't get the raise.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,I'm grilling leftovers- case closed.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,Let me guess...The boss turned you down for a raise again
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,Step 4 was ‘cook cabbage’ not baggage.
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,"You know you get 5-10 years for cooking the books, right?"
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,"Honey, I don't think that's what your boss meant by cooking the books...."
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,How would you like the books cooked?
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,Cooking the books again
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,My work is almost done.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,This whole work-life balance thing seems overrated.
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,A brief case of confusion
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,"""I don't think that's what they mean when they say, 'Bringing home the bacon' ""."
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,My boss said that my best idea was half-baked!
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,"Is this what they meant when they told us to ""burn the attaché?"""
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,"When you said it will be tough as leather, you meant it!"
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,Don't worry. It will taste like chicken.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,I don't think this is what your boss meant by a half-baked idea.
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,I should think with a young Bordeaux and a side of your left over portfolio.
1472,1,8,52,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05320507735360911,574,I must have left the steaks in the safe deposit box.
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,"The guys at the Firm say I need more practice grilling witnesses, figured I'd start with the Henderson case."
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,That should pair well with this fine Italian cut.
1472,3,4,54,61,1.1639344262295082,0.0626392563099764,574,You need a bigger spatula Honey
1472,2,6,53,61,1.1639344262295082,0.05811392555691986,574,I'm beginning to suspect that the Russians hacked my recipe site.
1572,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,574,I just cooked the company's books.
1572,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,574,This one should taste better than my Samsonite - no aluminum aftertaste.
1572,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,574,"On the bright side, leather comes from a cow, too."
1572,3,3,49,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06748805288278815,574,How will we know when it's done?
1572,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,574,This is your idea of vegan?
1572,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,574,"The recipe said "" grill the beef steak not the brief case""."
1572,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,574,Are we taking this recycle thing a little too far?
1572,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,574,The boss told me I have to get fired up about this project.
1572,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,574,"Grill briefly on one side, then turn."
1572,2,5,48,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06229957149539102,574,"Honey, the recipe called for a beef steak not a briefcase."
1572,3,3,49,55,1.1636363636363636,0.06748805288278815,574,Maybe you were right. Cooking hamburgers inside my attache case wasn't such a good idea. I can't tell when to flip them over.
1572,1,7,47,55,1.1636363636363636,0.05663776068232804,574,Are you sure this is how we cook the books?
1584,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,574,They'll never freeze my assets!
1584,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,574,Leather is the new aluminum foil.
1584,2,3,38,43,1.1627906976744187,0.0738907079406967,574,"I don't know. I was sitting at my desk when I suddenly thought, I don't want it well done, I want it incinerated."
1584,2,3,38,43,1.1627906976744187,0.0738907079406967,574,I think we'll be done in no time.
1584,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,574,Underdone ideas should be only half-baked.
1584,1,5,37,43,1.1627906976744187,0.06597285053646283,574,The recipe called for encased meat.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,It was a job well done.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,I'm getting even for the grilling I got at work today.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,It's my top secret recipe.
1590,3,3,52,58,1.1551724137931034,0.06414651699844254,574,I'm going to to get grilled tomorrow in the boardroom. I thought I'd prepare myself.
1590,3,3,52,58,1.1551724137931034,0.06414651699844254,574,"Unfortunately, Trumpcare only covered an American lager."
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,That is a rare medium well done.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,"I could have boiled it, but grilling gives it that nice charbroiled taste."
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,"Well, I guess my mother was right; I'm going to have to be the breadwinner in this marriage."
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,Having a hot case sounded much better on Law and Order.
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,"And then he said, ""Chambers, you're not doing anything with your weekend until everything in this briefcase is done."" I think it's just about ready."
1590,0,9,49,58,1.1551724137931034,0.04795720603166536,574,The food channel said business dinners are the latest thing.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,"Technically, it's still leather and comes from a cow so..."
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,"So when the handle is crispy, it's done Martha."
1590,3,3,52,58,1.1551724137931034,0.06414651699844254,574,"Love that delicious complexity of spread sheet litter, ball point ink, and forgotten tuna sandwiches."

1590,0,9,49,58,1.1551724137931034,0.04795720603166536,574,It should be done by the time I'm 65.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,Boss says to cook the books.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,Shit.
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,"Give it another hour, it's hard to tell when lawyers are done."

1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,We turn it after 20 minutes and serve when both clasps pop.
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,Nothing better than a job well-done.
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,"Grilling his attache, Gus fundamentally misunderstood Mr. Mueller's advice."

1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,It looked so much better on Masterchef.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,A grill? Whatever happened to getting a gold watch at retirement!
1590,0,9,49,58,1.1551724137931034,0.04795720603166536,574,I wonder when this case will be done?
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,Let's see the Russians hack these files.
1590,0,9,49,58,1.1551724137931034,0.04795720603166536,574,"If I cook it briefly, it will be a rare case."
1590,3,3,52,58,1.1551724137931034,0.06414651699844254,574,"If we slice it thinly, it should be digestible."
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,First day of summer. I decided to cook the books al fresco.
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,"Well, you told me you didn't like my briefs..."
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,How do you like your leather?
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,I have the amicus briefs marinating in the fridge.
1590,1,7,50,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05389670015798332,574,"Oh don't worry, it will be well done."
1590,3,3,52,58,1.1551724137931034,0.06414651699844254,574,"I shouldn't be telling you this, but I was told to cook the books"
1590,0,9,49,58,1.1551724137931034,0.04795720603166536,574,Vinny said I should start cooking the books.
1590,2,5,51,58,1.1551724137931034,0.05924369135592007,574,Maybe you should have married a hunter-gatherer.

1857,0,7,45,52,1.1346153846153846,0.04779328093727965,574,I definitely asked for a 'Hibachi' case.

2114,0,6,43,49,1.1224489795918366,0.04731438007905969,574,My boss said to go home and cook the books.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,"I know its tough to grill an open and shut case but we have to try.I have a lock on it, trust me. The handle is the toughest part."
2114,0,6,43,49,1.1224489795918366,0.04731438007905969,574,"Well, it seemed the safest way to cook the books..."
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,"Nothing says ""hard-working but not obsessed with success"" like grill marks on your briefcase."

2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,Grill marks are the rage on Capital Hill right now....
2114,0,6,43,49,1.1224489795918366,0.04731438007905969,574,That should cook the books.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,So he did cook the books.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,Should be done with my work in just a minute or two.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,I'm told grill marks make things look more genuine.
2114,0,6,43,49,1.1224489795918366,0.04731438007905969,574,It's cedar plank. It locks in the flavor.
2114,0,6,43,49,1.1224489795918366,0.04731438007905969,574,"Honey, I thought I told you to stay inside and toss the ball point pens."
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,The recipe said a brief cooking time.
2114,2,2,45,49,1.1224489795918366,0.06276408873212902,574,"Should have done the marinade, not the dry rub"
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,Like my new beefcase?
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,"Don't worry, I'm hot on the case."
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,We're gonna need some extra barbecue sauce.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,"Like my career, it isn't done in the middle."

2114,2,2,45,49,1.1224489795918366,0.06276408873212902,574,Still haven't quite figured out this retirement thing.
2114,2,2,45,49,1.1224489795918366,0.06276408873212902,574,should've brined it.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,"Honey, I don't think this is what your boss meant by ""cook the books""!"
2114,2,2,45,49,1.1224489795918366,0.06276408873212902,574,I got tired of bringing home the bacon.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,Maybe just the books next time.
2114,1,4,44,49,1.1224489795918366,0.055578689246150295,574,"Is this your not so subtle way of conveying work hard, play harder?"
2114,0,6,43,49,1.1224489795918366,0.04731438007905969,574,"I know, but it's organic and locally sourced."
2114,2,2,45,49,1.1224489795918366,0.06276408873212902,574,I'm hungry for early retirement.

2114,0,6,43,49,1.1224489795918366,0.04731438007905969,574,Just be careful not to choke on the annual report.
2114,2,2,45,49,1.1224489795918366,0.06276408873212902,574,Saw it on Guy Fieri's new show 'Cooking The Books'.

2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,This is not what they meant when they told you to cook the books
2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,"Nonsense! I marinated it for 24 hours, it'll be fine."

2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,I have just one burning question
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,I forgot to stop at the butcher's after work.
2358,2,1,42,45,1.1111111111111112,0.06530597929391763,574,It didn't happen if there's no evidence so stop complaining and drink your wine.
2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,Is this why my burgers always taste leathery?

2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,Boss said it's not cooking the books if you grill the briefcase.
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,I'm just banking the coals
2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,Dose he always have his lunch heated this way.

2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,"Now, isn't this much better than shredding all those documents."

2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,Hope this is right. I've never cooked the books before.

2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,You should have skinned it first.
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,Honey are you sure the butcher understood you?
2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,"He said to cook the books, he did not say how long on each side."
2358,2,1,42,45,1.1111111111111112,0.06530597929391763,574,It's an old Trump family recipe.
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,"They said my career was toast, didn't they?"

2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,"So, how would you like your files, rare or well done?"
2358,2,1,42,45,1.1111111111111112,0.06530597929391763,574,They said I can't handcuff it to my wrist until the documents are completely done.
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,I realized that every great idea I ever had happened right here.
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,I'm cooking up some hot briefs for the senior partners

2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,We agreed the grilling is MY business
2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,It's 100% lean.
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,"Hurry up James, The President Trump is about to arrive"

2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,Is that another one of your half-baked ideas?
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,I prefer work rare but of course the boss always wants well done.

2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,At least it's not shoe leather.
2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,"Sorry, I'm pretty sure it's not vegan."

2358,1,3,41,45,1.1111111111111112,0.057050590894718936,574,Does twenty seconds on each side before grilling sound about right?
2358,0,5,40,45,1.1111111111111112,0.047377936967913425,574,We'll deduct the meal as a business expense.
