425,5,12,62,79,1.2784810126582278,0.06479866419247653,569,"And then finally, we have one carry-over item from the spring board meeting."
425,2,18,59,79,1.2784810126582278,0.05679046615991113,569,I'm up in the air on this too
425,5,12,62,79,1.2784810126582278,0.06479866419247653,569,I take it back. There are *some* bad brainstorming ideas.
449,1,18,53,72,1.2777777777777777,0.05671712135968739,569,I see we've just launched our new human resources program.

450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,Next on the agenda is a report on our agile management initiative.
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,Ignore him. He's just flying by the seat of his pants.
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,Let me just jump in here.
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,Since November he never worries about political correctness.
450,7,7,63,77,1.2727272727272727,0.07072605501959082,569,We'll start once he's been recognized by the chair.
450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,"For God's sake, Bill, aim for the window."
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,I'm just practicing for when United throws me off the plane midflight.

450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,"Todd, wouldn't it be easier if I just got you a chair?"
450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,It'll get really awkward when the women start doing it.
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,"Look. If you want a chair, you have to get here on time."
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,Hostile takeover!
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,Mind if I join you? I got thrown off my flight.
450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,Cliff suffered from unexpected flatulence
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,"Whoops, wrong office pool."
450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,And he doesn't even have a golden parachute.
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,"Didn't the memo say ""dive right in""?"
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,"You're so agile, so bold, so energetic, so...fired"
450,2,17,58,77,1.2727272727272727,0.05738778058387522,569,And now Johnson will present his report on business disruption.
450,0,21,56,77,1.2727272727272727,0.05108649881354693,569,I think that a note of levity is in order.
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,Bet he doesn't make the splash he's expecting.
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,Millennials.
450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,All I can tell you is how it looks from where I sit.
450,5,11,61,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06571642001294437,569,I think we should higher him.
450,2,17,58,77,1.2727272727272727,0.05738778058387522,569,Is Robert the only one who is up in the air about this?

450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,He thinks he's above us.
450,5,11,61,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06571642001294437,569,I thought the board recommended we go head first?
450,5,11,61,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06571642001294437,569,I knew that we'd regret giving shareholders access to the ejector seat button!
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,Am I out of the box yet?
450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,"Nice, Evan, but we still need to vote on the budget."
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,"As you can see, ejecting you from this meeting is an option that's always on the table."
450,5,11,61,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06571642001294437,569,He runs the office pool.

450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,"Excellent overview, Reeves."
450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,Phillip knew it was a big jump from internship to board of directors.

450,2,17,58,77,1.2727272727272727,0.05738778058387522,569,It was a mistake not to give him a seat at the table.
450,2,17,58,77,1.2727272727272727,0.05738778058387522,569,Now that's how you photo bomb.

450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,I believe in the Peter Pan Principle.
450,5,11,61,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06571642001294437,569,He is upwardly mobile.
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,"I'll show you how to create waves, Earl!"

450,3,15,59,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06029196347774089,569,I don't think you quite understand how a hostile takeover actually works.
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,"I meant, feel free to jump into the DISCUSSION..."
450,2,17,58,77,1.2727272727272727,0.05738778058387522,569,He confused grande and venti again.
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,The music stopped and he had no chair.
450,4,13,60,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06306254323811782,569,"Hensen, would you like to jump in on this subject?"
450,6,9,62,77,1.2727272727272727,0.06826720558933075,569,"God, he can drone on."

765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,OK. The three burrito lunch was not a good idea.

765,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,569,I told Brian that he needed to make a big splash on his first day.
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,"No Bob, the spring Board Meeting."
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,"Someone needs to stop telling the new hires to ""jump right in""."

765,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,569,Did the decaf and regular signs get switched again?
765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,One giant leap for me. One small step for the rest of you.
765,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,569,"I've asked Carter, here, to jump start the discussion."
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,"Doughnuts weren't quite enough, but I think the cattle prod is a bit too much for our employee motivation initiative."
765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,"Oh, Bob...I hate this...we always get soaked!!"
765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,"And next up, Angela from Accounting, with a double corkscrew back-flip."
765,0,14,48,62,1.2258064516129032,0.053533794753437405,569,Your motion is not approved.

765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,So that's it: Your suspension will continue.
765,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,569,Uh Oh - No chair

765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,He's never been able to just say 'I've got an idea.'
765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,"Tim, if you like this idea, let's hit the ground running."
765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,I thought the invitation said 'springboard meeting'.
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,He never knocks

765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,"When you breathe Helium to make your voice sound funny, does anybody know how long it lasts?"
765,4,6,52,62,1.2258064516129032,0.07057726333454416,569,"It's one thing to be late, but must you make yourself conspicuous?"
765,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,569,"Frank, you could have just said as much, but by all means jump right in."
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,"If he sticks the landing, let's hire him."

765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,I knew it was a mistake to give him a golden parachute.
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,"Oh, this is gonna be a 10."
765,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,569,"If you're late for a meeting, at least make a great impression."
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,Ted misunderstood the concept of the office pool.
765,0,14,48,62,1.2258064516129032,0.053533794753437405,569,He's always jumping to conclusions.
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,I warned them not to hire that guy. He takes things way to literally.
765,2,10,50,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06263791695329896,569,"Oh, how tim flies !"
765,1,12,49,62,1.2258064516129032,0.058263950350759514,569,I liked it better when he just dove into his work.
765,3,8,51,62,1.2258064516129032,0.06672577740289717,569,He's from the office pool

1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,Rather have him 'dive in' than 'pick our brains'.
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,"She said to lean in, not jump in!"
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,Is this a drop-in meeting?
1963,2,2,38,42,1.1428571428571428,0.07286591006438153,569,"We understand ""Market Disruption"" Higgins. We don't need the demonstration."

1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,"Collin never tired of demonstrating, that when aided by a fart, he could get his feet six feet off the floor."
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,"Dave, I told you not to eat the beans!"
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,"Turns out the ""L"" in that new elevator stands for launch, not lobby."
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,I'm torn regarding his fitness for the job.
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,"This next dive is called ""an impression of our company's stock"""
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,Another way to crash the meeting
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,"Oh, that's just George springing into action!"

1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,This is going to hurt.
1963,2,2,38,42,1.1428571428571428,0.07286591006438153,569,"It's plain to me, we need a product that moderates excessive gas ."
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,Hold everything. We had better reevaluate our shoe business!
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,I thought we had installed a net after the last crash.
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,"Alright, alright. We'll find you a chair."
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,Will someone please catch me?!
1963,2,2,38,42,1.1428571428571428,0.07286591006438153,569,"We told you last time Henderson, there is just no market for an invisible ladder!"
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,Don't you wish Dan would go back to just leaning in?
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,Corporate musical chairs is so much more fun!
1963,2,2,38,42,1.1428571428571428,0.07286591006438153,569,Meet 'Cannonball' Ken.
1963,3,0,39,42,1.1428571428571428,0.08044178662449615,569,Corporate said we needed a hype man.
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,He always flies in by the seat of his pants.
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,"And now, please welcome the new director of the FBI"
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,I think we need to cut back on the number of disruption metaphors in company memos.
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,Am I getting your attention now?
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,"Well I'm here, aren't I?!"
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,"Ah, here's the latest board member parachuted by the president."
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,I'm trying to restore that sense of childlike glee we all felt when getting into trademark law.
1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,Better late then never!
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,"Steve's ""we're all part of a simulation"" hypothesis is about to get real."
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,And I'm going to keep doing this until you give me chair.
1963,2,2,38,42,1.1428571428571428,0.07286591006438153,569,Ball. Cannon Ball.

1963,2,2,38,42,1.1428571428571428,0.07286591006438153,569,I said would you like to raise an issue
1963,1,4,37,42,1.1428571428571428,0.0644049739048166,569,The sales for our new trampoline are skyrocketing.

1963,0,6,36,42,1.1428571428571428,0.05464943254828616,569,"Sorry, Ted. That's my usual place."
2229,0,6,37,43,1.1395348837209303,0.05346670079545209,569,No one has ever stuck the landing on the table.
2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,"Don't worry, he's always trying to get the jump on everyone."
2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,"You said to ""drop in"" to the meeting after my 4:15 ended . . . ."
2229,0,6,37,43,1.1395348837209303,0.05346670079545209,569,"I meant ""hop right on it"" after the meeting is over."

2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,I guess the office pool has a new winner
2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,His parachute failed.

2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,He's finally gone off the deep end.
2229,2,2,39,43,1.1395348837209303,0.07122869869716944,569,What!! Never seen someone fly by the seat of their pants before?
2229,2,2,39,43,1.1395348837209303,0.07122869869716944,569,"If we don't start turning a profit, the guys upstairs are going to come down hard on us."
2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,"Simmons, we do NOT cannonball at board meetings. You're supposed to be bending over."
2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,I came flying when I heard the news!
2229,1,4,38,43,1.1395348837209303,0.06297704189640278,569,"I know this sort of thing only happens in a 'New Yorker' cartoon caption contest but you have to admit, my being inexplicably airborne does offer the potential for a halfhearted chuckle."
2229,0,6,37,43,1.1395348837209303,0.05346670079545209,569,I heard you were looking for an angel investor.

3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,We know your cannonball is great. Now show us a swan dive.

3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,"Poor guy. The downsizing policy is getting more stringent all the time. Now, when they let you go around, company policy promises a landing spot. But to get a golden parachute you have to be a Managing Partner."
3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,Our junior associates are Millennials. You can't just tell them to drop by anytime.

3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,Maybe we need to rethink this report
3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,"I don't think there's any doubt that you can do a great 'cannonball, Pierce. But I asked you about sales in your region."
3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,He's just seen Trump's latest tweet. Can't tell if he's doing a cannonball or getting ready to duck and cover.

3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,"Sure we admire the level of commitment, Harry....but that ""Geronimo!"" stuff, that's just unacceptably culturally appropriative. Once you land, please go see Ted down in HR!"
3953,0,1,24,25,1.04,0.040824829046386304,569,Hi. I'm the spirit of profitable bankruptcies.
