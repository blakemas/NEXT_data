12,2,1,1,4,2.25,0.47871355387816905,513,We forgot the myrrh.
23,1,4,0,5,2.2,0.22360679774997896,513,This is so awesome. No one has any clue we're going golfing.

27,2,0,2,4,2.0,0.5773502691896257,513,I misunderstood when the partners said they were giving us the same case.
27,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,513,This case is anything but brief.
27,1,2,1,4,2.0,0.408248290463863,513,This is not what I meant when I suggested we have a three-way!

111,0,4,1,5,1.8,0.22360679774997896,513,Should we share a cab?

135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,I told the judge it would be a long case.

135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I remember when bribes fit in a normal briefcase.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Bloody team-building exercises.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,It's a bargain compared to the briefcase for two.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"When we go through security, I'll do the talking."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"An MBA is useful, but rowing team experience is essential."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"The judge is right, you've got to shorten the length of your briefs"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Thanks for the help, it's a really big case."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Got enough air in there?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,We are working the same case.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Because nobody wants to be left holding it.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"Cut it out, Johnson. Brakemen don't steer."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Geez, Talk About a Merger..."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"This meeting should put an end to the ""Where's Hoffa?"" question."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,What can I say? This 'sharing economy' thing has really taken off.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,How much more can we merge?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"At first I was skeptical, but I'm starting to really like briefcase pooling with you guys.."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,You guys aren't planing to eliminate the middleman are you?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,One more mistake and you're off the case.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"I know, right? It's a new OSHA reg when moving a tripod."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,At least we can take the HOV elevator now.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"In retrospect, I don't think I fully understood what ""making partner"" entailed."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I hear they want hire one person to replace us.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Make no small plans.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"If anyone asks, just say it's a long story."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,But we just went to the bathroom.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,It's a big case.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"At our next meeting, I get to be coxswain."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Next week we go after Yanni's keyboard.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Remember: Let's be brief.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Somehow, I never envisioned myself as part of a lawyer three pack from Costco."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"First, they made us share an office. Later, they made us share a cubicle. Now, this is just RIDICULOUS!"
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,Work hard and one day you'll get to the middle.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,They're taking this merger much too seriously if you ask me.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"You're right-handed, kid. No way you could ever be #2."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Wanna bet they try to cut out the middleman?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Mergers...
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Personally I don't see any redundancies here do you?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Small price to pay for the iPhone 14.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Your first time filing a 1040 long form?
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,You're just not middle management material.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,So... how long have you played team billiards?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Job sharing is a joke.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Keep working hard, Jacobs, and someday you'll move up to second handle."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"Sorry, but Charlie and I don't need to go to the bathroom right now."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I used to think we were gong paperless.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,We want an element of surprise with a bit of fear
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I told you - keep in brief and to the point - but noooo.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,What do you want to bet its not the bonuses?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Not much....my lunch, some paperwork, a shovel... why do you ask ?"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Not sure briefcase-pooling is going to catch on.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,How many lawyers does it take to file a brief?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,The nuclear codes were a lot shorter before common core math.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"'Buy three suits, get a briefcase' sounded good at the store."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,They ain't gonna miss him for a couple of hours so as long as we don't do something stupid to bring attention to ourselves.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"Play your cards right, you'll be standing on this side in two, three weeks."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Just hold your end up and we'll do fine.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Like they've never seen a briefcase before!
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,This your first really big case?
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,Do you know how long it took me to get to the middle?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I'd like to go back to just carpooling.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,The key to a successful robbery is to act normal.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,You need to carry your weight.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,Sorry you have to deal with my baggage.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,I don't think this is how file sharing works.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"You guys know this is MY saxophone, right?"
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"Makes them feel better about our $2,000 per hour consulting fee."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Our coffee mug has three handles too.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,We all share the same baggage
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Why do we need a xylophone for the business meeting again?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Why does he always get to be up front?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I'm not totally sure this is reducing our carbon footprint.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,These mergers are so awkward!
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,What do you think about this new IRS Long Form?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Ironically, I stopped carpooling."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Next time, we buy one with wheels."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,This has to be the only opera with three offstage bassoons.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Just try to act like this is completely normal.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Accessorizing with synergy suits you.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Look. We're paid to stretch things out.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,It was a brief life.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Yes, I realize I should have checked the paper settings on the printer."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"You're right, the elevator is faster."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Do you remember the procedure for when I need to switch hands?
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,We really need to get in the same carpool.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Well, it's certainly not a brief case..."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,It gets us in the cafeteria HOV line.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"We're drifting right again. Smedley's not much of a team player, is he?"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Are you ready for the shareholders meeting?
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,It's Trump's briefs.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I think we all have a handle on this now.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I'm guessing you're right handed.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Are we all on the same page?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Have you ever been to a mortician's board meeting?
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"That's just the way it is, least seniority gets the back handle."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Bathroom,anyone?"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,On this case you're co-co-counsel.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,I put in two years with the third handle.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Just remember, small hands big briefcase."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"So my daughter tells me we should be worried about this thing called ""the cloud""."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I love the new suitcase pool.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Yes, the case has been extended."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"Well, you're taking the middle seat in the plane."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,Are we all going to the same meeting?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,We also have to screw in a light bulb today.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Twenty-five years to settle the Fender estate.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Pool cues. What's your line?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,People will talk about this merger for decades.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I don't really feel that I'm pulling my weight.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"Now, you're sure they insisted on the long-form contract?"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,We need a smaller briefcase.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Middle management is harder than it looks.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Yes, Jeff, I get it -- you're a manager. But you're not a *middle* manager."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,We have long legal briefs.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,They're the XL files.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"I wouldn't really say this case is brief, exactly."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Then I'll say, 'Your honor, this case is not brief.'"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,It was a very long brief
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,Who suggested we have a giant hoagie for lunch?
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,They will agree to settle before we even open it.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,And that's how I made it to middle management.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"He fudges the numbers, I display confusing graphics, you close the deal."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I don’t care if you have a blister. Get over here. We look stupid.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Gosh, Mark Cuban is an a$$hole."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"By the way, Collins- welcome to the firm of Collins, Collins, and Collins."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,You sure you saw this in GQ?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Just walk in backwards. It's easier, believe me."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Who knew file sharing could be this much fun?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"I know you've got your eye on my job, Ted."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Do you think they suspect we're cutting out early to go surfing?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I was just made partner.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"So apparently we all ""work well with others""?"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,These team building exercises are getting cumbersome.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,We'll show them what bureaucracy is.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I preferred it when we could just fire a guy.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Did you see that strange lady on the elevator?
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"Okay, this is good. We all have a handle on it now."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,The strategy is to draw this case out.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Well, it's not exactly a brief case."
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"This draft might get through the House, but the Senate will find it too long."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I'm wondering how brief this case is gonna be.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,His last request was to be alphabetically archived.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,First time as an Executive Pallbearer?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,What's a computer?
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Glad you could join the firm. We needed a third hand,"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Remember…tight on the left turns …and take it wide on the rights.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,Sharing files was easier at my last job.
135,0,3,1,4,1.75,0.28867513459481287,513,"""So this is what they meant by 'becoming a partner'?""'"
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I still say we should not have brought the long form!
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I'm so already over the sharing economy.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"Frankly, gentlemen, the prosecution is always tremendously intimidated by the size of my legal pads."
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,I think the benefits of file sharing were grossly exaggerated.
135,1,1,2,4,1.75,0.47871355387816905,513,"If our seats are three across, we should be able to get some work done on the flight."
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,Fine next time you can have shotgun
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,"""Briefs"", my ass!"
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,I always thought 'the long arm of the law' was just a figure of speech.
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,If you weren't right handed we could get a nice cadence going.
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,You get used to it after you've been job sharing a while.
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,It's quite an honor to carry Mr. Trump's briefcase.
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,I'm just happy we're not sharing a brain.
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,I never understood purses.
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,This wasn't my idea of a triumvirate.
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,'Who's turn to take it home tonight?'
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,I'll be so glad when the jury comes back on this nasty faulty ironing board liability case!
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,How do you always keep your end up?
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,"So, you're on the other side of the case now."
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,How did you get him in there?
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,This would be a lot easier if we carpooled too.
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,He insisted on a wide screen presentation.
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,"When the boss said he had a big case for us, I thought he was talking legal."
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,In this case size matter's.
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,Don't worry. This sharing economy is just a fad.
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,You've obviously never been an 'Express Rest' pall bearer before.
305,1,0,2,3,1.6666666666666667,0.6666666666666666,513,"I think too much emphasis is put on ""works well with others."""
305,0,2,1,3,1.6666666666666667,0.408248290463863,513,Act nonchalant.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,Did you bring the key?
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,I'm starting to think our life insurance pitch may be in bad taste.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,Do you think we're taking this car-pooling thing too far?
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,They're right: our reimagining of the laptop has some obvious flaws.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,This job-sharing policy has gone a bit too far.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"Don't forget, you're the one steering this bad boy."
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,You think the prosecution is prepared for a lengthy case?
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,I heard I'm getting promoted to front handle soon.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Just sharing the workload
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"Todd wanted to let you know, he left a nice layer of palm sweat on that handle for you."
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"As you'll learn, we're all about collaboration here."
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,You weren't kidding about a heavy caseload.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Consultants need to make a really big first impression
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,It feels wrong calling it a briefcase.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,We can handle this case together.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,This is not a very brief case...
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"From now on, I'm going to handle this case my way."
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,We never speak of this again..
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,Legal-sized paper is for wimps.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Want to case-pool next week too?
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,Some day I'll have my own bassoon.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,I think this job sharing thing has gotten out of hand.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,It's bad enough the company makes us share a room.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"Remember, they have no evidence of collusion whatsoever."
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,I've never been a pallbearer at a corporate funeral before.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,It's not a briefcase — it's a lengthy case.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,You would think she never saw a threefcase before.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,I didn't think this is what you meant by file sharing...
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,There really is an Uber for everything now.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,Oh but you should see the size of the prosecutor!
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,That chick was bangin'!
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,I thought legal pads were already too long.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,It's great to have you on this case!
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,One day you too could be middle briefcase.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,You know what they say about men with long briefcases.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"Assistant VP, deceased fluorescents. And you?"
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,He insisted on a contract no longer than one page.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"Going to open the meeting with your man walks into a ""board"" joke again, Phillips?"
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,Next year we file the short tax form.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,I understand you've thought of a way to reduce our carrying cost.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,"I remember when they used to call these ""brief"" cases?"
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Now we can triple-bill the client.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,The sharing economy has officially gone too far.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"It's still considered a 'Brief "" case."
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,The briefcase is obsolete... that's our sales pitch.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,What do you mean you want to cut out the middleman?
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"Remember, now, we never disagree."
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Let go on three. Ready?
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Flat Stanley's final wishes were to be shredded.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,We should all be on the same side.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,I've learned that the middle man gets paid for doing nothing.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"""When do I get to be up front'?"
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,"This is our first big case, boys. Let's not mess it up."
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,You'll never move up a handle with an attitude like that.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"Hey, thanks for filling in--Harvey got called away onto a much bigger case."
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,You're the new adjunct attaché?
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Welcome to the sharing economy.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Must feel strange being the right-handed minority.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,I'm glad we all work on the same floor.
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"I hope they don't eliminate the middle man."""
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,You're right. He does fit.
327,0,3,2,5,1.6,0.24494897427831774,513,I'm in middle management. And you?
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,Did you remember the iron?
327,1,1,3,5,1.6,0.39999999999999997,513,"I don't think you're on the right side here, Smedley!"
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,The airline charges for each carry on.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Of course, size matters"
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I told you not to get H.R. involved.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Some aspects of this corporate merger are silly.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,You're not going to like the executive washroom either.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,This was supposed to be a job for one-handed couriers.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,These team building exercises are getting awkward.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Longest brief I ever wrote.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I thought I was just going to share the office!!
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"As a former pallbearer, this way is a dream come true."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Now, isn't this the coolest way to steal their silverware?"
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Larry did you forget to poke holes?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Someday I hope to move to the first handle.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"In five years, I'm gonna be the guy holding the front handle."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"I don't mind sharing an office, but this is ridiculous..."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I'm ready for the training wheels to come off.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I think we've got a handle on this.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"I was asked to be a pallbearer for last quarter’s strategy, too."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Her purse looks big enough for a human head. Creepy.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"As usual, Greg's not holding up his end."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"It's sort of an eco thing, uses the whole alligator"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Never thought I'd be a Les Paul bearer at this age.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Did you remember to bring the extra-long paper clips?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Smith, you are going to have to start pulling your own weight."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,What makes you suspect that we're co-dependent?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,No. You're in the back because we're left-handed.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Don't forget- we don't yell Happy Birthday until she jumps out.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,First big case?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,It's gonna be a long meeting.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Remember, we shake hands at the same time too."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Why was she staring at us?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I think we lost because we haven't mastered brief writing.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,They said to bring a body of evidence.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,He lost Florida to Trump and goes home to rest.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"I get the carpooling, but remind me how this is better for the environment again?"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I hope you put your name on your lunch.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,It's his 3 piece suit.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"There's no 'I' in 'Team,' Tim."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Don't you think they're carrying this ""TEAM Work"" thing a tad too far?"
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"I'm okay with ride-sharing, but this is going too far."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I need to get out of middle management.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,If he reads the whole contract we are screwed!
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Tragedy about the steamroller but Joe sure made it easy to be his pallbearer.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Briefcase-Pooling
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"The case was tricky, but the whole firm had a handle on it."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"This time, I'll be Larry, he'll be Moe, and you can be Curly."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Yes, you're correct, it was less expensive than three individual brief cases. But I'm not convinced of its practicality."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Not every case is brief.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"I hate being in the middle, I hate that we all dress alike, and I hate that you’re always on the other side. Other than that I think we make a great team."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"I'd help fellas, but I only make 79% of what you do so you should be able to handle it."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,These corporate mergers can be awkward.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Hey stop complaining. I NEVER get the window or the aisle seat.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"So, how are you related to the thin man?"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Think of it as a stretch briefcase.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,They said this would be brief.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Let's see what she does if we drop this and run.

391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Be cool. We're only here to case the joint.

391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I hope this huuuge case distracted her from noticing our small hands.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,So how does this work with carry-on?

391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"OK guys, I totally get carpools, but how is this supposed to help the environment?"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I fear you're on the wrong side in this issue.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Why shouldn't it be you at the back of the briefcase?

391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,We should have filed the short form.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I hope you remembered the fulcrum.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Yes, POTUS' list of potential Supreme Court nominees is getting quite long."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,This is the weirdest themed funeral.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"It's a case, but it's not a brief case."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,This way none of us can be fired.

391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,i'm really tired of holding up your end
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Job sharing used to sound like fun.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I'm getting really tired of all the synergy initiatives
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Short sales are so much easier to execute.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Remember. We can't look like pool hustlers.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Expect this briefing to run long.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,This thing is like a nicotine patch for my pall bearing addiction.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,We don't need an *actual* ladder to get promoted.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,It's a really big account.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Next time we file a brief, we should use a narrower font."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Yes Mel, ""The Will"" mentions a preference for Southpaw pallbearers"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"First the open office, then the shared desks . . . now this?"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,We're filing the long form.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I hate presenting to mortuaries.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Its a campaign contribution.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,They're going to shred it and spread the ashes across the Pacific.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Remember: BE the trifecta.

391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Is there a turnstile?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I told you to play the flute.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"As a cost saving measure, we're now considered one full-time employee."

391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Someone should have told me about the Boss's Inner Punster before I insisted that we all be put on the same case.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"God, I hate group projects!"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I draw the line at sharing my briefs.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I use this to carry giant squeeze packs of catsup and relish in case one of the IT guys brings another giant wiener for lunch.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"At the interview, remind them that we also carpool"
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Of course Stanley would have wanted it business as usual.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I love explaining that I can't stay late because I'm case-pooling.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,We let go on three
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Ever handled a case this big?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"We've got this Davis, we really only need two pallbearers for the thin man."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Sharing a desk is OK, but this is ridiculous."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,This is the most collaborative office I've ever worked in.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Listen up, we first say, 'Boss, we have a new Stradivarius', and then we open fire."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I trust the pen is in here this time.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"There's collaboration, and then there's codependence."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I thought I was taking the lead on this case.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I apparently didn’t read the fine print of the RideShare program.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,This is my first big case.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I carry you two.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,HR is trying out a few new ideas around the shared work space concept.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,This isn’t what I had in mind when I signed up for job sharing.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I really hope no one feels an irresistible urge to tell a light bulb joke.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Pallbearer's United, Local 6"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Elevators good. Revolving doors bad.

391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,We bill by the handle.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,The boss wants everything in triplicate!

391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"If you fit, we'll sneak you out next."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I'm going to room 218. You?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I think we have a handle on this case.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Can you handle it?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"I gotta be honest, I find elements of the merger demeaning."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,El Chapo is a genius.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Seriously Bob, don't worry. The first gig was a fluke, everyone loves triple neck guitar groups."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"What did you think ""three for the price of one"" meant?"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Well why not, we car pool don't we?"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Accounting insisted we file the long form this year.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,So how did you know Slim?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I don't know about you but I have a really good feeling about that interview Jeff.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,And if something should happen to him... Bam! We both move up.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I told you stupid ideas work.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Yeah, but just wait until you see the new legal pads!"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Remember, our strategy is to keep the presentation short."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,The D.A. said that this would be a long case.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I told her it was the gun legislation.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"This ""Three's Company"" reboot has really jumped the shark."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Your first day and you're already sharing a big case with the partners.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Get off my case, Fred."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,'Things get dicey in the bathroom.'
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,You don't really have to do this.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"It's not that I mind the middle handle, I just don't feel like I'm carrying my own weight around here."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I'm getting really sick of this redistribution of wealth...
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I worry that I'll never move beyond middle management.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,What's up for the weekend?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Why do they always want small unmarked bills?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Chauncey, let's not have any of that 'thinking outside the box' crap during today's presentation shall we."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,You're sure they said actual boiler plate.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"When he said we'd be sharing cases, I did not take it literally."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Whose turn was it to bring lunch today?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Remember: our thinking is ""inside the box""."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,We will win this big case!
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,First we had to share a cubicle.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,We're anticipating a long trial.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I thought we'd never lay this case to rest.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Does this mean we have equal shares?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Escalators and stairs are a bit more challenging.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Talk about luck...three xylophone players in one office.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Yes, it is a big large for a briefcase, but it's where Trump keeps his other set of hands."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Sometimes I wonder about this new sharing economy.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,The judge said he dislikes long briefs.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,They're going to downsize. The middleman always gets it.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,...appears we're on the same career track.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Our presentation may go a bit longer than planned
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I'm not sure this is what Corporate meant by consolidating departments.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,It's an honor to be pallbearer for the latest budget killed by the board.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,The knocking is going to give us away.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I definitely prefer acquisitions to mergers.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,When they said I'd be in 'mergers and acquisitions' I had no idea.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Good idea not bringing the 4th guy, we'd have looked pretty silly."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,They said it was a three man job
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Now you know what we do with people who give lousy elevator speeches.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,What happens when one of us has to go to the bathroom?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,So you're the right-hand man.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"I don't recall ""heavy-lifting"" being included in the job description."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I love our union too.....
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Perhaps we should have stopped at carpooling?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,What happens when one of use needs to use the restroom?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Stay close.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"It adds weight to our recommendations, and we charge more. Remember, don't smile."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Someone needs to tell the old man what file sharing really means
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,This job sharing isn’t what I thought.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Just be grateful they removed the handcuffs.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Can't believe TSA didn't blink
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Does this merger feel a bit awkward to you?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"If we forgot anything, I don't know what it could be."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"A word of advice Evans, you don't want to do anything here that makes you stand out."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Next year they'll let us start carrying our own briefcase.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to merge our companies.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,He was wrong about being carried out of here in a pine box
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Nothing about this case is brief.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Have you guys heard any more about the downsizing?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I've always wanted to be a pallbearer.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I would have expected you to be on the left.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"I know we're in a sharing economy, but this is ridiculous."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Fortunately, the prosecution didn't have much of a case."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,This is nothing. Wait till you see the mens room.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Did you remember the key?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Mr. Trump likes to keep his comb close at hand.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,And briefcasepooling saves on what now?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"The Donald brief's are in here. They're huge, if you know what I mean."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,You're absolutely certain he said bedspread and not spreadsheet?
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Be alert. There's a revolving door up ahead.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I've never been to a briefcase's funeral before.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,I had to use the long form.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,It's going to be a long meeting.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Is this really synergy?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Taking this merger business a bit to far, don't you think?"
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Next we change the light bulb.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"I'm beginning to resent these long, drawn-out cases."
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,These corporate bribes are really getting out of hand.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,This is not what I meant by file sharing.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,So you're the new guy.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,They used to call this a brief-case.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Slim deserved a better send off
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,This isn't the threesome I had in mind.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,"Remember, the trick is to act invisible."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,Think they'll figure out we are not a string quartet any more?
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,"Ok guys, let's make this brief."
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,It's a merger case.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,The shredding is today; but we'll scatter the ashes on New Year's Eve.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,You gotta wonder who has the time to read these long briefs.
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,I hate group work.
391,0,2,2,4,1.5,0.28867513459481287,513,This job sharing is going too far!
391,1,0,3,4,1.5,0.5,513,Three's Company

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"When we asked if you were a lefty, we weren't referring to your politics."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"No, it's the 31st. Your turn starts tomorrow."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It would look funny if there were two of us carrying a briefcase.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Thank goodness for concealed carry.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We have the edge. The contrabassoon will totally throw them off.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,The embalming rotation is breeze.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,And to think we bought the last one!
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,That's how you give a big presentation.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,'I think it's time you and Frank got your own briefcases'.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I guess I'm not quite sold on this Briefcase-B-N-B idea.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It seemed like a good idea at the time.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,How do you think she guessed we work at a surfboard company?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This new job sharing policy is great.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Poor Higgins. Packaging was his world.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,The boss is heavier than he looks.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I feel like we all have a handle on this case.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It looks like the deal is dead.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I thought for sure Cuban would have invested 200 grand for a 25 percent stake.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Another proposal that will be dead on arrival.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Get used to it. NRA amicus briefs are not friendly and they're not brief.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You wanna be on the right side of this case.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This all-in-one technology is getting a bit out of hand
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I look forward to the day when all of us can be on the same side of a case.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"No, YOU have to tell the boss her dog ran in front of a steamroller."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Well this is awkward

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,The boss has really been going overboard with his Costco Business Membership.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"2 can be as bad as 1, it's the loneliest number since...Capitalism, right guys?"

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Are you saying it smells funny ha ha or funny peculiar?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This job-share isn't as flexible as I thought it would be.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"I know they asked for the long form, but this is ridiculous."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Everyone wants to get rid of the middle man.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You'll only be able to see files I'm sharing with him
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"It's the ""not so brief"" case."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I wonder why the wives were so upset this morning.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Don't look at me, i'm just the middleman."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,you are on the wrong side again!
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,The flute paid the piper. This is his casket.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Maybe too much team-building?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It was only a matter of time for Airbnb to get into the funeral business.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"If a diamond-encrusted yardstick doesn’t impress them, nothing will."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This is definitely not a brief case.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,If we are caught claim you don't know me.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Not surprising that her husband was buried in a piano.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"I'm not sure that ""brief"" is exactly the right word."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Must you always take the opposing side of every case?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"I thought that went well except for the ""casket of the future"" crack."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Hard to believe that I first resisted this idea.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Now that Mr. Trump is president, it takes 3 of us to carry the nuclear football."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,These audits are killing me.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Remember, you're the back-up to the back-up."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Downsizing? It isn't a matter of time here, it's a matter of how."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Even with the three of us flying together, I don't think this will qualify as ""carry-on"" luggage."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"It's ""our"" report, but Slide 27 is all me."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Get off my case.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,How will we know when briefcasepooling has gone viral?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Okay, you can have the middle position on the way out."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Billable hours X 3, got it?"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"If they make any references to small hands, we unpack the big one."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I suppose this has as good a chance as any of distracting from the leg shackles.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"As long as we're outside the suitcase, I figure we must be doing something right."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,The rifle case lets them know that we mean business.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Why do you think we were called into this redundancy meeting?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You can try to fit this thing by your feet at the meeting.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"So my wife says, ‘Why don’t you each get your own briefcase?’ Women, right?"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"He's my mentor, just like you're my mentee."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This isn't about taking sides.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You are always too far left for us.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Is this the three legged race for hands?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Don't you find it strange that we're all wearing the same suit?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It is part of the company's new job share program.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We'll call it the not so briefcase.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We need to take our case to a higher court.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Somebody should tell her the express elevator is for briefcase-poolers only.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"At our law firm we only use 8-1/2"" by 70"" extralegal paper."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Well, our body of evidence is authentic."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,No one needs to know we are working together.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Honestly I kind of like the middle.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This is the longest brief I've ever filed.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"""As always, we're the 3 Briefkateers""."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"What's your problem? The boss said he wanted a big alligator case, so we got one, capeesh?"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I hadn't anticipated having to make room for a fourth person in there.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"I never thought that ""Working together on big projects"" would look like this."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This team building is getting out of hand.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Vertical integration is dead. Horizontal, however..."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I represent the Stooges.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Is this supposed to have all the money?

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It'll be noticed if you're not carrying your weight around here.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,The amateur pallbearers never practice.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Stealer's Wheel did Not have me in mind.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Actually, Bill, it's quite rare for an extended case to have a single middle man."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I'll do the talking.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This job sharing is becoming confining.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This case is not-so-brief.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,My last case was even longer.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We work for a cooperation firm.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Which way to the roof?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We're filing a long brief.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"They won't suspect us, we're not Muslims!"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Just act natural.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I think I still prefer a briefcase.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Yes, I am the middle man and I say we should have gone one floor up."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I hope three on an attache isn't bad luck.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Luck of the draw, I guess."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I wonder how she guessed that we all work together?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Get a grip, will you?!"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I'm a very hands-on supervisor.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Any fonts larger than 36 pts have to take the service elevator.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It looked a lot cooler on the Sky Mall website.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Carry-on can be a problem
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I think they're taking this teamwork thing too far.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It's nice to be on the case with you.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"What we lack in brevity, we make up in team spirit."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I really hope this is the last of the long forms.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"It's not a briefing, Wallace it's a long-johnning."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,No reason to be nervous - the other pallbearers will love our presentation.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"It's either Trump's hair, or the wall. We haven't quite figured it out yet"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This sharing economy thing is not all it's cracked up to be -- mind if we stop by the men's room on the way to the meeting?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,And what did you think job sharing meant?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I'll take it odd days; you two split the rest.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"No, I don't think this team-building stuff has gone a little too far."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I thought this was what he meant by a 3D presentation.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We really should switch to legal size paper.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I hope one of you brought the extra mouthpieces for our bassoon.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Do you think she suspects the boss is in the case?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Briefcase share, not so much."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I think that this is the second longest legal brief ever written.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,One piece of advice on your first day... watch the corners.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Ok , technically yes, this could be a threesome."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I told you the boss had big plans for us.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I don't know anyone who likes these new legal size documents.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I'm afraid the firm's experiment with six-foot legal pads is not turning out the way we'd hoped.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I'm used to being in the middle. I was a middle child.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Being run over has its advantages.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Why do they always send us righties?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You may have Tom fooled but you and I both know you're not carrying your weight.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Poor Stanley. He never saw that steamroller coming.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Taking collaborative work home sucks!
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You've really lightened our caseload.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Just be glad you only work on the *third* floor!

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I think we should each carry our own weight around here!
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I can't wait till they go digital.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I sense some distrust in these merger negotiations.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Do you think Barney will notice if I let go?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,If anyone asks we won it in Vegas playing craps
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It's the new teamwork model for lawyers........
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"With three guys on this case, we've definitely got them beat."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Have you seen our printer yet?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This new sharing economy is not going the way I expected.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Negotiations will be short once they see it's written in stone.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,The judge said it would be a long case.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Even split three ways, this is a very big case."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Did you see her shoes? Weird.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This team work stuff is getting out of hand.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Ashes require fewer pall bearers.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Throughout the entire service I kept wondering how they got him into a briefcase
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I found another briefcase pool that fits my schedule better. It's nothing personal.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Do you even lift?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Pastor always uses his massage table to lay on hands.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"When I first moved to Mergers, this was my first acquisition!"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"By the way, I won't see you guys next Monday. I'm taking the backpack."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"This is a two man job, new guy. Watch your back."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Three single briefcases weren't in the budget
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,remember you're the token leftist.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Why must you always be on the left?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Boss said marketing and sales had to work in tandem on this one, that's why."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Did you really think this would work as a carry-on?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"you know, ever since the boss started on nutrasystem, this carrying him to the limo is SO much easier..........."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We've got a long case ahead of us.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I hear that this holds the origins of the universe.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I hadn't realized he'd lost this much weight.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,He stays in step better than you do.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It was easier when they really were briefcases.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Told the TSA guy it was just rope for the three legged race, he just waved me through."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Dude, relax. I'm sure no one thinks this is a body.."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We know you're not doing the heavy lifting around here.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Ready for another long meeting?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This merger has gone too far.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"The truth is, 1/3 the pay is still a lot..."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,People keep pushing and pushing the sexual envelop.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I'd say we've tripled our productivity.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Our last partner never held up his end.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You're certain the competition is the Three Man Brief-Sled?

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"I told (""told"" underlined or bold) you it was a long shot!"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I hate it when people walk illegally in the briefcasepooling lane.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I find it a little more heavy than awkward.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,A team effort! It's a team effort. That's all I friggin hear.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"When we get in there, you guys drop your ends and I'll pretend it's really heavy."

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Would you please get on the other side. You're attracting attention and embarrassing us.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Please tell me this isn't that Thompson guy from accounting the boss canned yesterday.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Did you notice anything odd about her?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Perhaps we're taking this UberPool thing too far
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I miss the days when our briefcase was short and succinct.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Car pooling was bad enough but this is emasculating.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I think we need a coxswain.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Some lawyers use legal-sized paper. I prefer illegal.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,It took me three years to get the middle handle.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I still say this is a funny way to take our client with us.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Are you sure this is what the consultant meant by team synergy?
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Something tells me our project is DOA.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,XXL legal pads
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Nothing brief about this.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,And I thought sharing an office was bad.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We really killed that presentation!
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I get to go first next time
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,We sure got a good deal on this anaconda skin brief case.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,You seem out of step with our corporate culture.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I think it should end with car-pooling.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Tell me again, what's our Plan B?"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I know this firm is known for extra-long briefs ... but this is ridiculous!
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Polygamy case.

1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I had no idea this is what middle management looks like.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"Fine. Next week, YOU'RE the middleman."
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,"this must be a really,really big brief"
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,Not so bad being a pall-bearer for an anorexic.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,This car pooling thing is getting out of hand.
1017,0,1,3,4,1.25,0.28867513459481287,513,I guess we're having another sleepover.

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,This is not exactly what I meant when I said we should handle this together.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,The boss said we could make a case for bringing our kids to work.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Which way are you heading? I'm going uptown.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I think the people upstairs are taking this Teamwork Initiative a little too far.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,We should go for 'open carry.'
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I'm not sure this is what they meant by 'spreadsheet.'
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I am glad we saved with this new online bag sharing service.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"When you said merger, this is not what I had in mind"
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"On the other hand, I really think we should have separate toilets."

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Are you sure we shouldn't look inside before we bury this overly large briefcase in the desert?
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"We all have to be on the same side on this one, Fred."
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"After a while, you really get used to the job sharing program here."

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Did the judge say 'brief'?
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Do you think they believed our commitment to teamwork?
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I think we may be taking what we learned in that team building seminar too far.

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I felt you'd take that side of the case.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I don't think this file sharing service is worth the money.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"That's what I thought, too."
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,How many suits does it take to deliver a severance package?

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,You're not pulling your weight around here.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"Gary likes the briefcase. When you're carpool captain, we can use the backpack."

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"Hey, I'm thrilled the company is doing so well. But upsizing has its limits."
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I told you we were going to look like idiots.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,These board meetings get any longer we're going to need more help.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Do you think we can get this guy through security?
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"What did you expect? It is a limousine company, after all."
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"I can't believe I'm working for the NRA. I can't believe I'm about to meet a senator. Hey, what's in this briefcase anyway?"

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,A bicycle built for two made a lot more sense.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I don't know about these new team briefcases. I don't like sharing my briefs.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,We now have evidence that we fit the meaning of team players .
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I knew we'd find a way to carry this case forward.

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,This Millenial ‘sharing’ thing has gone too far.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Whose idea was it to take car-pooling to the next level?
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I think we should go digital.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Remember to kill the conference room lights right when I go into my solo.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"Yes, it was Tinker to Evers to Chance."
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"Really, guys, does President Trump's wig case really need a Secret Service detail?"

1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Don't you think there is a better way to carry ladder?
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,Seriously? You really see me as a micromanager?
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,I thought I'd get in some ironing during the meeting.
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"Our work may get mixed up, but at least it can fit the entire hogie."
1809,0,1,4,5,1.2,0.22360679774997896,513,"As an accountant I shouldn’t say this, but the 1040 long form is getting to be ridiculous."
