1435,1,8,55,64,1.15625,0.05087893153952011,575,Raping and pillaging is so much easier with an army of tax accountants.
1435,1,8,55,64,1.15625,0.05087893153952011,575,"You did call ahead for reservations, right?"
1435,0,10,54,64,1.15625,0.045745315919462494,575,"I'm told they're the best hostile takeover men around, but I'm skeptical."

1530,0,9,51,60,1.15,0.046486739497974515,575,"I don't know, Daniel, I was giving my typical spiel about absolutism and the ascendance of the deregulated state, and they just sort of started to get in line."
1530,1,7,52,60,1.15,0.05221100171960861,575,"What they lack in terror, they gain in accounting."
1530,2,5,53,60,1.15,0.05736689334430969,575,I told you letting them walk was a ploy to jack up their billable hours .
1530,2,5,53,60,1.15,0.05736689334430969,575,They all want corner offices. Raping and pillaging isn't enough anymore.
1530,2,5,53,60,1.15,0.05736689334430969,575,How sure are you that the pen is mightier than the sword?

1530,1,7,52,60,1.15,0.05221100171960861,575,"I asked for an army of warriors, not lawyers."
1530,1,7,52,60,1.15,0.05221100171960861,575,These guys can certainly follow the leader but their side-arms won't be much good in a battle.
1530,1,7,52,60,1.15,0.05221100171960861,575,I told all of them to suit up for the next crusade. Boy ... the times have changed...
