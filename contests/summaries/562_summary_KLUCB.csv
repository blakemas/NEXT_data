1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,We'll just have to agree to disagree.
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,"Well, one of us is dying for sure..."""

1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,Context is everything.

1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,Well the law says I have to come back here to use the bathroom.
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,"So, what do you call a fish out of water?"
1049,3,2,35,40,1.2,0.08915558282417287,562,"Without the EPA, it's easier to breathe water than air."

1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,I agree. The Earthworm is an acquired taste.

1049,3,2,35,40,1.2,0.08915558282417287,562,My place or yours?

1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,Ever heard the expression 'like a fish out of water'?

1049,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,562,Long time no see.
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,"Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly. Maybe it's birds gotta swim, fish gotta fly."

1049,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,562,Wow! I guess sea level rise is not a hoax!
1049,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,562,It won't work. Birds gotta fly; fish gotta swim.

1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,One of us is out of their element.
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,Didn't expect to run into you here.

1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,This whole long-distance thing just isn't working for me.
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,"You know, birds started out as fish, so be patient."
1049,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,562,Holly moly! One of us must be very high!
1049,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,562,"um excuse me, I identify as a fish."
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,"Well, we can agree it's not a solid."
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,Any place around here where you can get a decent plate of worms?
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,Your leap first struck me as quantum.
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,"When they go low, you go high."
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,"No, I use lungs."
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,You could have knocked me over with a feather.
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,Want to sign up for Twitter? We're now expanding underwater!
1049,3,2,35,40,1.2,0.08915558282417287,562,We can't both be right.
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,"So, what time do you get out of school?"
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,"Your flying is impressive, but where's your landing gear?"
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,Well aren't you a breath of fresh air!
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,Are you here for the diversity training?
1049,3,2,35,40,1.2,0.08915558282417287,562,"I’ve always believed in global warming, but I had no idea it would advance so quickly!"
1049,1,6,33,40,1.2,0.07337993857053428,562,"Wait -- am I diving bird, or are you a flying fish?"
1049,2,4,34,40,1.2,0.0816496580927726,562,You need to get out more.
1049,0,8,32,40,1.2,0.06405126152203484,562,The humidity here is beastly.

1786,0,4,26,30,1.1333333333333333,0.06312427686319992,562,I seem to have taken a wrong turn...
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,Does this have to do with global warming?

1786,0,4,26,30,1.1333333333333333,0.06312427686319992,562,Oh yeah? Maybe YOU'RE the one who's out of his element.
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,And I always thought flying fish were a myth.
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,This disproves the the Bigger fish theory. What do we do now?
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,I've decided to completely change the way I look at my own flight privilege.
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,You weren't the perch I was looking for.
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,Pretty soon either you fall or I drown.
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,One of us is screwed.
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,One of us is pretty much screwed!
1786,0,4,26,30,1.1333333333333333,0.06312427686319992,562,Together we're both.
1786,0,4,26,30,1.1333333333333333,0.06312427686319992,562,I identify as neither fish nor fowl.
1786,0,4,26,30,1.1333333333333333,0.06312427686319992,562,"Being ""re-homed"" is not what it's cracked up to be."

1786,0,4,26,30,1.1333333333333333,0.06312427686319992,562,"You are not what I had in mind when I asked for ""chicken of the sea"" !"
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,"Well, one of us is out of his element. But which one?"
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,Mammals are so overrated.

1786,0,4,26,30,1.1333333333333333,0.06312427686319992,562,That's ridiculous! No one thinks that you're a fish out of water.
1786,1,2,27,30,1.1333333333333333,0.0792686880439847,562,I hope to leverage this into a car decal deal.
