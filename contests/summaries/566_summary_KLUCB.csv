651,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,566,How did he get past the interview?

651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,"To be honest, when he bragged that he grabs them by the pussy, this wasn't what I had in mind."

651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,"When he gets crazy and starts talking about making one of us walk the plank, we give him the cat and the hat and he calms right down."

651,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,566,I've got a bad feeling about this. Toxoplasmosis is nothing to mess with.
651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,Did you know I almost became a pirate? Now there's a man's life....
651,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,566,The cat represents a transitional love object for him due to a disrupted infantile bond he had with his mother. Very common.
651,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,566,You go tell him we forgot the cat food.
651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,"Sure, it's fine now. But wait'll it needs a scratching post."

651,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,566,Aaarrrggghhh! He just sits there like that since the cat ate his parrot.
651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,His meds must be working. He's setting realistic goals.
651,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,566,It bugs me that he also calls her Ishmael.
651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,He's named it Moby. I think he's just given up.

651,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,566,"He said, ""Look! A whale!"" And when I turned my head, he grabbed my pussy..."
651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,I think he said its name is Ishmael.
651,3,6,50,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06743033731044798,566,Ever since he got that cat the entire ship has been the poop deck.
651,1,10,48,59,1.2033898305084745,0.05812007671977909,566,"Yeah, but whales only have one life."
651,2,8,49,59,1.2033898305084745,0.06294757226340743,566,he hasn't been the same since he read 'eat pray love'
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"So the captain said we can ask if it's a service animal, but he's not required to show documentation"
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,That's not what he was chasing this morning.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,I didn't peg him as a cat person.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,Let's turn the ship around while he is distracted.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,What a strange fellow! He's sitting there by himself and just playing with his pussy.
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,They bonded the day the cat saw him crunch a mouse with his peg...
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,"SO HE SAYS TO ME, WHERE EXACTLY IS THE POOP DECK."
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,That guy is so 17th century
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,She'll never see him as anything but a scratching post.
730,0,11,45,56,1.1964285714285714,0.053571428571428555,566,"Of course she likes him best, he has a built in scratching post."
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,Anything that keeps his attention away from you-know-who.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Call me, Dumb, mate, but the Whiteness of the Cat ruined a great novel."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Who's going to tell him what happened to Polly?
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,Have ye seen me canary?
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,I think he misunderstood the President's message.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,You call her. You're the one that named her Peggy.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,Now he's obsessed with a white kitty. # Sad.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,"Oh, him?... He's one of them Pirates of Penance."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,I thought it might calm him down.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Yaar! Me thinks Peg-leg Willy's become a hipster.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Who'd ever name his cat Ishmael?
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Now I'm suspicious about the booty he said he'd share with us.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"Mate, its time to show the Captain the cat walk."
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"Don't get me wrong...I'm fine with gay sailors, but this guy kinda makes me uncomfortable."
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,Arrrr! I wouldn't have voted him captain if I'd known THAT'S what he meant!
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"...But NO, I can't have a pet barnacle."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,T'is true- he let's him use it as a scratching post.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,"His devotion to that thing is admirable. But to replace his leg with a scratching post, well, I think it's going overboard."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"When Kitty gets a peg leg, then I'll welcome her as one of the crew."
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,At least he found the great white cat.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,Easier on the limbs than the pet croc.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,He's a star. He can do that whenever he wants.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"The man's gone daft for that cat. When I suggested we call it ""Puff,"" he said it was ""Mewtiny!"
730,5,1,50,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07820902253536301,566,"Aye, when ye be a star, they let ye do it. Ye can do anything."
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,The boss can't keep his hands off the pussy.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,The whale was becoming a problem. We needed a stopgap.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,... when you're a captain they let you do it.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"He used to be a ""whale person""."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Fact: cat therapy is inversely proportional to narrative momentum.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Aye, it's been like this ever since the parrot disappeared."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Because his finicky cat only eats white meat, that's why."
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,But the first mate should be a person.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Damned if I know. Go ask Ishmael.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"As obsessions go, the Captain could do a lot worse than that great white cat."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,They're doing a sequel.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,I couldn't compete with a built-in scratching post.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Well, we always knew he wasn't a whale-lover."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Aye, 'tis an emotional support animal."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Just because he's retired doesn't mean he can violate the ""no pets"" policy."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"And then Mrs. Ahab said, 'It's either me or the cat.'"
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,I miss the mice.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,Pretend you don't notice it...It was a gift from his mother.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Ahab is responding nicely to pet therapy.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Best rat catcher on the high seas. And his cat is pretty good, too."

730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"He said, ""Because a can of tuna isn't good enough for my Captain Snuggles, that's why."""
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,Apparently his physical therapist thought it would help
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,The doctor gave Ahab something called Prozac.
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,"And why wouldn't they be close. He's got an appendage that doubles as a scratching post."""
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,Maybe this would be a good time to ask for a raise.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"He calls it ""Ishmael"", and claims he taught it how to write."
730,5,1,50,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07820902253536301,566,Peg leg Pete has really put that broken chair to good use
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,The captain's hooked.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,"Service cat, my eye!"
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,The new therapy for his whale obsession has proven to be very effective.
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,He's trained it to use the poop deck.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,If it wasn't for the leg you'd swear that Pete wasn't a real pirate.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,She only loves him for his scratching post.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,He's gone full James Bond villain.
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,"He keeps muttering, 'I'm going to catch you the biggest snackie you ever saw!'"
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,He never lets me do that.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Service pets are the rage for Americans these days, get used to it."
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,I'd give my right arm for a good dog.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,He only lost his leg so he could get a therapy cat.
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,She's cozying up on account of the scratching post.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Everytime we start talking mutiny, he shows us his redeeming qualities."

730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,I'll let you guess what it uses as a scratching post.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,She came back nine times--now's the time to bet.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"Okay, let's all be nice and casual until the Green Peace ship passes."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,Ever since he saw The Godfather it's him and that damn cat.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,I first noticed a change after he joined PETA

730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,I always thought Long John Whiskers referred to his beard
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,Yell 'thar she blows' and let's see what he does.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"In a perfect world, he would be navigating and she would be chasing rats."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Well, we do have the only rat free ship in the fleet"
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,"I don't care what he says, I was a much better first mate than Mr. Whiskers."
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,It's only a matter of time before he realizes who ate his parrot
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,I don't care if he is the captain. There's no way a whale will go for cat bait.
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,I'm not calling it Fishmael.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,What happened to the parrot?
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,So Melville heard--get this!--white tail as white _whale_.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,He grabbed it yet the boss still hired him.
730,5,1,50,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07820902253536301,566,He's hooked on pain killers.
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,Looks like great white whale has gone soft white kitty.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,He settled for Moby cat.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,I wouldn't have pegged him for a cat fancier.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,He's only three quarters Irish.
730,4,3,49,56,1.1964285714285714,0.07394119661316192,566,"Don't be fooled, this is how the last trip started. Believe me, it's not going to end well."
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,"So all this time, we should have focused on the 'white' part over the 'whale' part?"
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,I understand he has a therapist letter approving his having a therapy dog.
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,"Since he got his therapeutic cat, he forgot all about the big white whale."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Yeah, he found out that white whales are just crazy about cats."
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,Who will be afraid of a pirate ship with a therapy cat?
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Aye, I don't think our Cap'n has the stuff to inspire a classic novel."
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,The Captain says we can keep em both
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,I don't mind the cat so much as the branding problems.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,"Shiver me timbers, that beast is tamed. Although, it did cost he a leg"
730,3,5,48,56,1.1964285714285714,0.06941145371792481,566,"Yes, but it's a great white cat."
730,1,9,46,56,1.1964285714285714,0.05932325520851263,566,I'm not scrubbing the litter deck.
730,2,7,47,56,1.1964285714285714,0.064564690488571,566,And yet below we've still got rats the size of cantaloupes

843,2,6,46,54,1.1851851851851851,0.06515087083609597,566,He got rid of his parrot because it kept talking back.

843,2,6,46,54,1.1851851851851851,0.06515087083609597,566,I figured him for the dog type.

843,1,8,45,54,1.1851851851851851,0.05954682150320808,566,He's a lot happier since he go rid of his pet woodpecker.
843,2,6,46,54,1.1851851851851851,0.06515087083609597,566,I wonder what his parrot will think of this...

843,1,8,45,54,1.1851851851851851,0.05954682150320808,566,I hear it won't eat anything but white meat. Where are we going to get that way out here?
843,2,6,46,54,1.1851851851851851,0.06515087083609597,566,Keep the crew below deck until he finishes his meditation.
843,3,4,47,54,1.1851851851851851,0.07030965787335618,566,"He was right after all. No mice, no rats, no parrots."

843,3,4,47,54,1.1851851851851851,0.07030965787335618,566,He's a new man since he sold the rights to the name Starbuck.

843,3,4,47,54,1.1851851851851851,0.07030965787335618,566,It's cute. He uses the wooden leg for his claw pole.
843,2,6,46,54,1.1851851851851851,0.06515087083609597,566,I'll string up from the yardarm the b-b-bastard that took my pooty tat.

987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,I swear that if this guy gets us shipwrecked I am going to have to invent a whale of a story.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,And wait 'til you see where he let's her sharpen her claws.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"So he smote the sun, he got the cat, and now we can go home."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He needs the chair until he gets his sea leg.
987,0,9,42,51,1.1764705882352942,0.05391265523477457,566,"A short story, maybe, but I'm not seeing a novel in ""Moggie Dick""."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"Y'know Ishmael, if anybody but that cat had lost him that leg...."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Ever since we got him that cat, things have been much calmer round here. He's completely forgotten that unfinished business with the whale."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He's obsessing again.
987,0,9,42,51,1.1764705882352942,0.05391265523477457,566,Ever since the whale thing
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,Cap'n needs a $%^#@ bigger cat or a $%^#@ smaller obsession!
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,I convinced him that a white cat in the hand is worth more than a white whale in the sea.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,Scuttlebutt is that cat was once our shipmate and the leg with the shoe is full of gold.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"Ever since we left Denmark, he's been all about hygge."
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,The last captain only wanted his belly rubbed twice a day.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,That parrot was my best friend.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,Called him 'Fishmeal'!...
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He thinks this is a Carnival Cruise Ship. I don't have the heart to explain the pirate thing to him.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,The little bastard's eaten my last three parrots.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"So, whose idea was this retired pirates cruise?"
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,"Should we tell him we're looking for Treasure Island, not Ellis Island?"
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,Kitty-cat's litter box is on the poop deck.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,Yeah he seems happier. But he's lost interest in the white whale entirely.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He's going to need a bigger cat.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,I suppose its better than the white whale.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,I think it's the lithium.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,I haven't had good Chinese food since that cat came aboard.
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,"Whatever, more rum for us"
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"Doncha know, it was that very cat's mother, the tigress, who took his left arm and leg."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,Turns out he's more of a cat guy than a whale guy.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"So now he's all ""Call me Ishmeow."""
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,I didn't want the cat to like me anyway.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He's been like this since his parrot flew off.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,I say we tie that scurvy cat to the yardarm.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,He's training it to stuff itself into a blowhole on the inhale.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Yeah, he’s obsessed, but it could be worse."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"We welcome his pause for paws, the only time he stops talking."
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,"D'ye see him? Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels ..."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Trust me, Muffin will have the Capn chasing white rats like a Skinnerist."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,He's losing his piratin' edge. I saw Mr. Whiskers using his leg as a scratching' post.
987,0,9,42,51,1.1764705882352942,0.05391265523477457,566,He seems happier since he got the cat and gave up on that whale.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,No way he's getting soft. He's going to use it as bait.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,It's new corporate policy to be loving and caring towards animals!
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,He calls her Fishmeal.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Aargh, Blackbeard thinks this is a retirement cruise ship!"
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,At least there is a lot less damage to the furniture with the built in scratching post.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Arg, I told him to bring up the cat o' nine tails. And he brought up fluffy."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,The parrot was too messy.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,Should we tell him it ate his parrot?
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"So, when the pied piper ran out of mice, then what happened?"
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,It was the worst of times on a dark and stormy night when he named the cat Ishmael.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"First of all, that's not Abraham Lincoln and even if it was, he's not grabbing that pussy. He's petting it."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"Aye, an odd one he is...claims to have a new book idea called, 'The Cat in Me Hat'!"
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He never got over losin' that whale
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,"If they're gonna let the retired guys stay on board, they should at least make them dress like pirates."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,It was bad enough when he refused to dress like a pirate. Then he insisted on having a chair on deck but having tamed our best mouser just is wrong……
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Trust me. After my last captain, his obsession with the cat is refreshing."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,Looks like chef is contemplating something different for dinner tonight.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,This ship is for pirates not pussies!
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,I've been here for 20 years and he just walks on board as furst mate.
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,"He just sits there, very pleased with himself, and says when he gets to the New World he's gonna be a mover and quaker ......"
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,That bastard grabbed my pussy.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,When was the last time you pet me like that?
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He’s getting the peg-leg fare. The cat’s a service animal. That’s all I know.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,Captain Ahab has toned down his obsession.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,He calls it Melville. Go Figure.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"With him, everything is either an allegory, a metaphor or an allusion."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,Are you SURE that's the real Calico Jack?
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,His obsession with that thing will be his undoing.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"He said, ""If Trump can do it, so can I!"" And then he grabbed my pussy!!"
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,Over medicated. Again.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"To be fair, he had lost the fire before he got the cat."
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,"Aye, that guy's the only one without cat scratch fever. It's got everyone down below."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,Hasn't been the same since we got the white whale.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,I think we should tell Peg Leg what really happened to Polly .
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Oh yes, he can do that. He's famous!"
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,"Arrr, next thin' ye know he'll be wearin' a monocle."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Avast, Cap'n finds a cat that says ""parrrrr"" an' now he be a changed man!"
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,I think Captain Ahab is the cat's meow!
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Watch your language, Matey! The Captain calls it his cat's scratching post, not his peg leg!"
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,We'll be mopping the deck all day and night.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,We're all going to look pretty silly when they write THIS book.
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,I guess purr is the new arrr.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,The politically correct expression is 'passenger' and not 'prisoner' apparently.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"All I know is he was up all night shouting ""Have you seen the white cat?""."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,A cat o' one tail? Might as well not flog him at all.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,It'd break his heart if he found out what happened to the parrot.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"Thus, he gave up the spear."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,He's not the same Ahab we knew and hated.
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"The cat's cute, but I think I'll need something scarier for the novel."
987,0,9,42,51,1.1764705882352942,0.05391265523477457,566,Cute little galley cat. I think I'll name you Bowlin. Bowlin Galley.
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,Who let Steve Lincoln on the boat and why is he playing with dinner?
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,..so you do like the parrot with a dash of sea salt...
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Oh, so I can't bring my dog, but Mr. Top Hat over there just gets to do whatever he wants?"
987,0,9,42,51,1.1764705882352942,0.05391265523477457,566,This must mean that Polly has been neutralized.
987,0,9,42,51,1.1764705882352942,0.05391265523477457,566,"Sure, he loves cats, but his obsession is whales."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"As long as he's holding the cat, PETA won't let us use the plank."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"Weird. His pet is called ""Cat O'One Tail""."
987,3,3,45,51,1.1764705882352942,0.07252251768198795,566,His favorite story is Puss in Boot
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,Captain! Let go of our exterminator!
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Ishmael, I see the Captain finally lowered his expectations."
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,...he has become such a mopey dick
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,"Aye, he's a different sort of Captain at heart, too."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,"I'll tell ye mate, that cat's rehab for Ahab."
987,1,7,43,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06075267994050848,566,He's compensating for something.
987,2,5,44,51,1.1764705882352942,0.06689694944796853,566,He's hooked.

1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I haven't had any fun since that therapy cat showed up.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Look at that pussy over there ... I mean the cat!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It started when he discovered YouTube...
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I hear he's allergic to parrots
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He thinks that peg-leg of his allows him to do anything he wants during reenactments.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"...best cat owner ever, he even has a built-in scratching post."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,I've got to get upgraded next time. They will let anyone travel coach these days.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"It's symbiosis. He likes the cat, the cat likes the scratching post."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"The madness has gone, aye, but as to Ishmael's promise of improved cardiovascular wellness, it does seem a mite fanciful."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He says the cat keeps his timber from shivering....
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He's decided to start small and build up to a whale.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,First it was whales. Now it's rats.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Look what the cat dragged in.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,That's Dan. Says a pirate ship's better than America.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,It seems that both of them have seven lives left!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"After we have him walk the plank, that cat can get rid of our mice."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,I didn't want to be first mate anyway.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"His recruitment poster said, ""Hunt the Great White."" How were we to know he meant Mouse!"
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He better watch his other leg with this one.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,I don't know how much longer we can distract him with a white cat.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,His leg makes a great scratching post.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He says that for the rest of the trip we have to use a cat-o-eight tails.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,We were supposed to get a parrot.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Your cat, Mr. Johnson! I thought he was a goner!"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,My parrot now only purrs and meows.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I liked Ahab better when he had that other obsession.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Raid for Zyrtec at the next port?
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,That’s his Happy Place.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The peg leg got him the job; the cat almost lost it for him.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,At least his next obsession will be easier to find.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Turns out he was more of a cat person.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He settled for a white cat.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Isn't that the captain's chair?
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Nope, he hasn't mentioned the white whale even once since we gave him the cat."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,There's something a wee bit fishy going on between those two if you ask me.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"The more often he scratches her neck, the less she sharpens her claws on his leg."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"Aye, let the shark bite it clean off so Whiskers could have a scratching post."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"one day a giant white whale, the next a fleabitten tabby. what say ye, ishmael...is monomania not a fickle mistress?"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The new guy? Name's Blofeld.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He's a lot nicer with this new obsession
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"I don't know, but he is a man with a cat."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Well, after all, he does have a built-in scratching post."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,A whale didn't bite off Ahab's leg--the crazy fool had it made into a scratching post.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He says he is a cartoonist with a caption block.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,His cat has only one tail
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,I'll take the cat.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He said the passage was going to cost him an arm and a leg. I see he's only paid half.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Why is he playing with his pocket pussy
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The rodent problem was never fixed.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,It's been proven effective in treating O.C.D.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I miss my labradoodle.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He already ate the dog.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"You ate the parrot, didn't you? You do know I have a sharp hook..."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"I tell ya, mate, those Emotional Support Animals are amazing!"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"First let him satisfy his curiosity by 'walking back the cat', and then we'll make him walk the plank......"
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"Why can't he just share his money, now that he is with us?"
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I suspected that Ishmael fella was a therapist
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Well, so much for our double-rations of rum."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Damn it Ishmael! Just tell him about the whales!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Yep, that's Ahab. Since he got that kitty, he doesn't seem to chase whales."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,The rodent problem was never fixed.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,One word out of the cat and the parrot is back!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,That demon whale sure buckled his swash.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The captain's therapy cat has been an absolute godsend!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Air Force, obviously."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,They say he lost his leg and his mind grabbing at pussies.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"He's sure now,with a familiar he can find where the leprechaun sank the pot of gold."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I hardly recognize him since he became a purrate.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,We've got to maroon him at the next rest stop.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"""He seems to love the new cat but why does he call her Bait""?"
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Wait'll it scratches his leg.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I hear he's working with a therapist.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,That cat really loves the Old Salt.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Comfort Pets ...what a scam.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"He named it, surprise, Moby Kit."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Melville got it wrong!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,That leg used to be a lot thicker.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,His leg doesn't smell so bad since he swapped the dog for a cat.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,So that's what he meant by grabbing pussy.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,But he KNOWS the captain has allergies...
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I think your heartburn's getting worse
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Love is love is love.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"If that's what retirement looks like, forget it!"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It's symbiotic. She scratches his stump.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"There's no story in an obsession with a Great White cat, but . . ."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The lepre-conned our Captain into thinking he and the cat bring good luck
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"No fair, he has his own scratching post."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"He didn't even know who Moby Dick was until Puddles came on board,"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Nobody even notices his leg anymore.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Rumor has it the Executive Health Insurance Plan also includes six weeks of 'rage reduction therapy' without any deductible.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He thinks he's being presidential.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I think we'd better keep this to ourselves.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Let's throw the dumb cat overboard and tell him that white whale ate it.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Umm, I never saw him as a cat person"
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Best whale bait there is.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Just our luck, we raid a ship with an oversized, emotionally needy, one-legged lepricon."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,A therapy dolphin would have helped his career
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"A rare combination, great ship's physician and a mobile scratching post."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"She used to be my cat, but I couldn't compete with someone who has a scratching post for a leg."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He scratches the cat's back and the cat scratches his leg. It just works.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Cap'n says he now identifies as a gentleman.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"It's kind of ironic, wouldn't you say, that he's wail and blubber with the white whale but wussy with that white pussy."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,If only he would stop grabbing it
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"Well, that explains the hair covering Ahab's peg leg."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"If you ask me, he's got an albino fetish."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He calls him Mobycat...
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"I don't know, they both look good."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Just when you think you're special he turns you into bait.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Any luck finding Captain's parrot?
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,I don't know what to think about that Schrodinger.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"He really is a ""Dick"" head!"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"When Captain said ""find the rat"", do you think he meant figuratively or literally?"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,We have to get past Abraham Lincoln first...
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Yesterday it was the white whale, today it's tuna!"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"He keeps mumbling, ""What's the best Tuna, Chicken of the sea"" !"
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"Aye, me boyo, he's holdin' pussy, but he's thinkin' Dick."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Mr. Darwin says it is a form of mutualism.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"No, it's like Cap'n told ye. Mr. Parrot's on a nice island playing with lots o' other friendly parrots."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Trust me, matey, it's better than havin' a Cap'n what's obsessed with a giant whale."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Crew for me he says. Pussy on every port he says.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,He's obsessed with alliteratives. Maybe a 'captain's cat will pacify him.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Still nothing. Let's give him a dog next and see if he finally moves.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Ever since the parrot died he's been trying to get it to sit on his shoulder.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"He's one of them ""fightin' Irish"". Better leave him be."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It's a therapy animal.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"Shiver me timbers, I tawt I taw a puddy tat."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Carl didn't fit the pirating standard.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"Ay, that Seadog has a leg to stand on when it comes to rearing them felines. They're good luck you know. 'Cept when they're not."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I miss the white whale..
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I’m thinking the cap’n is a little OCD about white creatures.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I've never known a man so obsessed with an animal.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,The Cat ate his parrot.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"He's been ever so much calmer since he had the hook replaced with the cat, but no one has seen the parrot since!"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,His ex kept the booty and he got the cat.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Captain Hook's pre-morbid symptoms of male spinster syndrome. It starts with just one.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Leprechaun or pirate, he needs to commit."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,If only my parrot had nine lives.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Does your stowaway policy mention animals?
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He really has the traits to be president some day.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,His name is Trump.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Don't worry, you'll still have eight left."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Four years crisscrossing the Pacific and he settles for a white cat.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Capn' Lucky!....tell that to the parrot
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Fine, let him keep it. I'm not going to be the one stuck taking care of it though..."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The guy smells like old money..
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He's the cats favorite scratching post.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I wouldn't wanna be around when Polly finds out.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Call me Ishma..a..choo! Sorry, allergies."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"""I warned him he'd have trouble filling his days if he took the redundancy package ""."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"As a couple, they're deadwood."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He's been that way since the folks from Greenpeace stopped by.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The new cat loves the scratching post.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Polly want another parrot?
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I hate it when the cook gets that look in his eye.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"When he takes up knitting, it's either mutiny or the M & A guys."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"I'll swab the deck, but don't be expectin' me to clean the first mate's litter box!"
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Of course the cat favors him. He has a built-in scratching post.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,That's that unlucky bastard Nugent. Nasty case of cat scratch fever.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,This therapy cat works great. Joe does not wear his eye patch any more!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"They gave the captain a wooden leg, how come kitty wasn't given eight wooden tails?"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I'm pretty sure that's not Blackbeard. And that's definitely not a parrot.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He just hasn't been himself since he got a companion animal.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Is that the new management?"", ""Arrrr, he's not from around these parts!"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Your turn to remind him to change the kitty litter.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Cat's called Ishmael. He talks to it like it's a person, always going on about some white whale we're supposedly chasing."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It’s no accident he calls each one “Chum.”
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,If that's a parrot then I'm a ballerina!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The cap'n seemed to lose interest when we installed GPS.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The honeymoon will be over once it scratches him.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"The parrot, the eye-patch, the swashbuckling hat -- Marketing said it all had to go. But the captain drew the line at the wooden leg. He was too attached."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He used to be a tuna boat captain.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Someone should tell him that Peg Leg sounds more pirate-y than Cat Dad.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"He woke up grouchy, but now he's in a good mewd"
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Abe's right. This deck is way too neat for a pirate ship.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He calls it his comfort animal.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He said a parrot didn't go with his look.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Ay Matey...He's taking a HAIR of the CAT that bit HIM.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"I know it makes for a better story, Ishmael, but that's not a whale."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"""Wouldn't have pegged you as a cat person, Captain"" says you?"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Get a load of Captain 'Emo'
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Only matter of time when he begins walking around here with that cat sitting on his shoulder...
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He's a changed man since the OCD meds
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,No human likes to be lonely
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,They let you do it when you're a star.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,If we really want his blessing NOW might be a good time to ask.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Self-navigation has unmanned the captain.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,Says her name is Peg.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,We're gonna need a bigger cat.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"They say cats have 9 lives, let's test theory at sundown."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I'm not fooled by his latest pivot.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"Before we sailed, I never understood what he meant when he said ""I working on a pet theory."""
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He's thinking of using live bait.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,At the very least we should keep the cat so it can deal with the mouse problem.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I like him. He took my trousers up an inch.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I miss the mouse stew.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It's a cat-o-one tail
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Don't tell Herman.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Some call the white cat Moby. And is he ever a dick.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"I'm allergic too, but it's his Therapy Cat..."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"So my editor says, ""Ishmael, use your imagination."""
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"You can tell the tale of Moby Kitten, but I ain't."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Wait 'til Cap'n Rusty Scuffer finds out Fluffy ate our treasure map. Then, we'll see who'll be eatin' tender vittles by moonlight."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,That cat! It's crazy about whale bone.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It's not fair! We should all get some cuddle time with kitty!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Matey just worships his new fur baby - and the cat gets a great scratching post.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"Aye, matey... and have ye not heard of Maggy Dick, the Great White Cat?"
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Another wife successfully lost at sea.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"So, Herman, how does great white cat fit into your story?"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,She's Peg the Fifth
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,The cat? The whale? No wonder there's no diversity on this crew.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"That cat killed the mice and the roaches, what are we going to race now?"
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He needs another ball of yarrrrrrn
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Kitty, the secret is just between us."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"He says he just isn't a ""parrot guy""."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I'm glad he got over the whale.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Arghhh....she's only with him for his scratching post.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"It's only the white ones he keeps fixin' on, mate"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Call me Snowflake
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Seems like a contented guy. Is he always that affectionate with animals?
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It's the only thing that keeps his mind off the whale.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"He calls it ""the great white kitty."""
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Cute kitty, but we're running low on jerky."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He hasn't put that cat down since he set foot on the ship.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"I'm sorry Bill, you're a hot mess."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Times are changing on us, is a metro-pirate still a pirate?"
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Ahab says if you are a celebrity, you can grab any pussy you want."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"See, nothing makes you forget missing legs and Great White Whale-hunting - like a Happy Birthday kitten from the crew..."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I have an idea for the man and cat overboard drill.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He thinks he can scare us with that cat-o-one tail.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He just walked up and grabbed my pussy!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"It's a hard life out here, but she'll always have a scratching post with him."
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Worse yet. He's signed a tell-all book deal to benefit Greenpeace.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He's got upurrrr management written all over him.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,I'm more of a dog person
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I hear that the cat is going to be the bait
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,I told you guys the captain gets to eat the cat first.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He calls this one Ishmael.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,They must have focus-grouped the ending.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,"Honestly, I don't know which one he is more obsessed with."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,At best he's a minor character.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,Softer side my ass; it's whale bait.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He's never been the same since the Sea Shepherd incident.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,Anything I say would be considered dirty.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,She's only after him for his scratching post.
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,He's the entertainment?!
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He got to bring a cat? All I got to bring was syphilis.
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,It's our decoy.
1599,2,1,37,40,1.125,0.07327066086497203,566,"I'll try it, but I don't think much of 'scurvy cat' as an insult."
1599,0,5,35,40,1.125,0.05295740910852021,566,"I'm tell 'ya, there just ain't somethin' right about that new captain."
1599,1,3,36,40,1.125,0.06392603899459486,566,He catches the mice for her
1872,1,3,37,41,1.1219512195121952,0.06242187264424257,566,Who let Schrödinger on the boat?
1872,1,3,37,41,1.1219512195121952,0.06242187264424257,566,"I thought after the mutiny they would've made me captain, not the cat"
1872,1,3,37,41,1.1219512195121952,0.06242187264424257,566,Any other pest-control suggestions?
1872,1,3,37,41,1.1219512195121952,0.06242187264424257,566,"He keeps telling it about his leg, so the rats are running free."
1872,0,5,36,41,1.1219512195121952,0.051739520574625435,566,He is promising her a very big -- huge -- fish for dinner.
1872,1,3,37,41,1.1219512195121952,0.06242187264424257,566,The new wave of immeowgrants.
1872,0,5,36,41,1.1219512195121952,0.051739520574625435,566,He's allergic to whales.

2199,1,2,36,39,1.1025641025641026,0.06141463024552095,566,That cat's as relaxed as a one-legged man on a pirate ship.
2199,1,2,36,39,1.1025641025641026,0.06141463024552095,566,We never should have found the great white man!
2199,1,2,36,39,1.1025641025641026,0.06141463024552095,566,he's a mouseketeer privateer with a brogue purr
2199,1,2,36,39,1.1025641025641026,0.06141463024552095,566,I say let him stay. The captain's been cross what with being the only scratching post on this ship.

2199,0,4,35,39,1.1025641025641026,0.04921614717627658,566,I was there when she dragged him in.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,I think he's got this thing about a large albino mouse too?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Well, if you were hobbling around on one leg you'd need a therapy pet too."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,Ever seen a cat-o-one tail?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,She only loves him for his wooden leg!
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"Call me, Ishmael, if his obsession with white animals gets worse."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"He looks harmless. He just keeps saying "" ho ho hum and a bottle of rum""."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,This may be a good time to tell him about the termites.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,It's called a cat o' nine tails minus eight.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"It isn't a peg leg, it's a scratching post."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Captain grabs everyone's cat, mate."

2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"Ok, the cat therapy makes the Capitan FEEL better - but it doesn't catch a Great White Whale!"
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I think old peg leg has gone soft on us.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Wouldn't be countin' on booty, Rudy"
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,It just wants a scratching post.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Whale off, therapy cat on."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,People can really change on these long voyages. Fred used to be a dog person.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,What happened to the parrot?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I don't see how an emotional support cat is going to help him with his larger problem.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"The cat's name is Margaret, never call it by it's nickname."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Turns out he was ready to retire.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Aye matey! There'll be no more blather about ""pieces of eight"" now, will there?"
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,He's downsizing. His pet tiger bit off his leg.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,I hope she likes whale.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"""He used to be a helluva tap dancer before he became a cat-person""!"
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,He never says a word... the cat has his tounge.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Wuh?
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Great recommendation on Peg-Leg Lincoln and Mrs. Gigglesworth...
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Trouble here, mate. We're out of milk."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,The pussy will do that to ya.

2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"I'm done feeling sorry for him, he's had his share of the kitty."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"It's OK, I checked; he brought a letter along for an emotional support animal"
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,If that's Long John Silver I'll eat his hat.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"I don't know about you, but the dreaded pirate Blackbeard and Mr. Whiskers doesn't exactly roll off the tongue."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"I wouldn't do it, Matey. You'll never get into politics if you keep grabbing their pussies."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,We're out of water. Whats the cat gonna do for us?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I guess he's attending Pirates Anonymous now. The cat's his transitional object.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I knew things would change under the new CEO. But rebranding into a tuna boat?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,It's touching to see how he has learned to forgive.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I think our captain now has different priorities
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"If he names it Ishmael, I'm outta here."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,We better tell him the pile of rope is not a litter box
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"Instead of giving Polly a cracker, he gave Polly to the cat."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Why Do Villains Always Have Cats?
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"Aye, the Great White Cat beckons....."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,She uses his wooden leg as a scratching post.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,'That cat better not scratch out his eye.'
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"Well, he does catch a lot of bilge rats."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"I asked him and he said fuck the whale, I got me a kitty cat."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,His morning mewsing.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,A habit?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,He thinks he is Abe Lincoln with Tabby
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I tell you ever since we got that cat for Captain Ahab for his birthday there has been no mention of the White Whale.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"As a couple, they're useless."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Dad's mellowed since the amputation.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Your the only cat I sea.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,The cat found a new scratching post.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,It's like we're in the wrong box of cereal.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Since he discovered pussy, the Captain's stopped obcessing over Moby Dick."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Not a confidence builder.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,Always blubbering over that cat.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,He's a scratching pole that scratches back.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,That be Davy Jones' Puss
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,He calls it the white whale.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,He sure held out a lot longer than we did.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,He thinks that cat will keep him warm. Wait'll we sail into the Arctic sea.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Did you tell him we have a dress code; and don't allow pets in the mess?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"That used to be me, purring on his lap."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I guess he misses his other pussy
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"Ever since he's had the hand transplant, he's changed!"
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,The antidepressants have done wonders for the Captain.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"So it's polydactyl, it's still weird"
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I've got a bad feeling about this.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,Are you sure Michael's Moore's vision for a Civil War reenactment is going to work?
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,Not sure if Ahab there got the idea from 'The Godfather' or Dr. Evil.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,I'm going to keel haul the captain's Secret Santa.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"He used to touch me like that. ""Let's have a cat together,"" he says. ""It will make us even closer."" I carried that scratchy cat embryo in my abdominal cavity for months and this is the thanks I get. Feel goddamn invisible sometimes."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,Peg doesn't know Planky likes to scent the wood.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"Big deal. It'll just wait till he's dead, and eat him then."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,His therapist recommended lap rehabilitation.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,"It's a ""I scratch your back and you scratch my leg arrangement."""

2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,The cat only likes him because his leg is a scratching post.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,The Dutchman put catnip on his wooden leg and now she's his true love.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,I hear the rats are filing a protest.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,This confirms it: I've never been a cat person.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Aye, keeps the pirates away - fearful as they be for their parrots."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,It came when he called it Ishmael.
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,He's transitioning to a new stereotype. That's his emotional-support cat.
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"Or, the cat."

2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"He heard the cat go ""mee-aargh"" and it was all over."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"According to the Captain, it's a Lowell cat."
2215,1,1,32,34,1.088235294117647,0.06496464222510488,566,Pray this bloke doesn't face rough seas. It's one thing to stroke your favorite pussy. It's another to deal with all those hair balls....

2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,"If you find his cat obsession creepy, wait until he starts going on about the whale."
2215,0,3,31,34,1.088235294117647,0.04937482703908927,566,The cat loves him. His peg is a moving scratching post.

2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,I never expected a happy ending.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,He's all about whiskers these days.

2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,He knows my love language is touch.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,What he really wants is 50 tons of cat food!
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,I like cats! They taste like chicken.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,I thought he was totally legless when he came aboard.

2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"Don't fret, my kitty. They just told me the travel ban doesn't apply to pets."
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"No mistake, matey, the cursed White Rodent, him that gnawed the pegleg, has felt the mouser's claw!"
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Now it's all about the white kitty.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"As long as you tie the knots right, they let you wear anything you like."
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,The cat likes him 'cause he smells like tuna.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"A show to placate animal rightists. What is their problem with whaling? For the first time in history, the industry has made America great!"

2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,You'd think he's on a whale spotting tour.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"Yeah, I know: Abe Lincoln holding a cat. I'm layin' off the rum."

2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Aye. The doc said a few minutes a day with the cat would help the Cap'n take his mind off the other thing.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Just wait until the cat finds its scratching post.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,Mr. Whiskers only loves him more because of the scratching post.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Won the trip and the cat on some game show.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,He reminds me of that guy from 'Fiddler on the Hoof.'
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,That's O'Reilly. He's the black sheep in a family of pussy-grabbers.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,The captain loves Whiskers. Whiskers loved Polly...but in a different way.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"Once he tires of that kitty, he'll fixate on some other poor creature."
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"I thought getting him a pet would make him a more relatable leader. Instead, the cat is now First Mate and dog parks have lost all funding."
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,He named it Mr. Meow.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Ever since the mutiny he's been chasing the white cat.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,"Captain says he wants to come back as a cat when he dies, I think he's already come back as a jackass."
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Says he wants to turn us into a nonprofit.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,His cat is a good ratter. Grab it when he walks the plank.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,He doesn't know it's a rat.

2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,He doesn’t look like any Super-Villain I’ve ever seen.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,They can be so cliquey.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,A parrot? Victim of import controls.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,He thinks he's fooled us by calling it Polly.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Captain promised us Calico Jack - not a calico named Jack.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,He's a lot more easygoing since he got that service cat.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,I bet you the new guy is stealing all the treassure.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,I heard he picked her up at Starbuck's.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Ahab seems a lot more contented since he found Moby Pussy.
2456,1,0,29,30,1.0666666666666667,0.06666666666666668,566,He eats pussy.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,He is avoiding the cat walk
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,Cats taste better than parrots.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,He says that he's waiting for a Mr. Godot who should be along any minute now.
2456,0,2,28,30,1.0666666666666667,0.046320555585310084,566,"Aye, but if he keeps up all that belly-rubbin' in public, it's gonna ruin our sea cred."
