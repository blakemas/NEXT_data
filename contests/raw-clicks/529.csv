Of course I understand the gravity of the situation.,70,55,48,173,529
It's easy once you realize there's nothing to it.,69,54,43,166,529
There's really nothing to it.,64,56,36,156,529
I'm virtually there.,61,52,33,146,529
"Can't stop now, i'm virtually there.",64,60,31,155,529
"See, there's nothing to it.",67,42,35,144,529
I'm suspended by disbelief.,68,50,34,152,529
"If he's going to pretend he can build that wall, I'm going to pretend I can climb it.",62,40,31,133,529
There's nothing to it.,63,43,31,137,529
Because it's not there.,67,24,35,126,529
"No, the hard part is knowing when you've reached the top.",61,47,26,134,529
I'm headed for an air B&B.,61,32,29,122,529
Can you lend me a few bucks? I have no visible means of support.,58,38,26,122,529
The ink is much thinner up here.,53,60,18,131,529
"See, nothing to it!",64,39,28,131,529
Anyone can climb a mountain that's There.,61,35,27,123,529
"Why? Because it is not there, that's why.",64,33,29,126,529
It's mime over matter.,62,31,28,121,529
Are you the only person in the world without a cell phone camera!,61,40,25,126,529
The hard part is knowing when I've reached the top.,56,44,21,121,529
"Quick, call a cartoonist.",58,39,23,120,529
I just suspend disbelief.,51,52,16,119,529
This? This is nothing.,49,38,18,105,529
The hard part is knowing when I get to the top!,55,39,21,115,529
"Believe it or not, Jack, this is easier than winning the caption contest.",62,29,27,118,529
It's reality I don't have a grip on.,55,43,20,118,529
"It's your dream dude, you tell ME what it means.",51,26,21,98,529
The gravity of the situation hasn't hit me yet.,57,33,22,112,529

Nothing to it.,59,42,20,121,529
Mime every mountain.,54,34,19,107,529
Because it isn't there. That's why.,52,25,20,97,529
The tricky part is knowing when you've reached the summit.,53,39,17,109,529
My GPS says there is a mountain here!,59,41,19,119,529

If you see the cartoonist have him drop me a line.,58,26,22,106,529
"Wait, you can see me?",56,30,20,106,529
I'm climbing it because it's NOT there.,57,34,19,110,529
Do you know my brother-in-law? He also has no visible means of support.,55,26,20,101,529
I don't think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation.,45,26,15,86,529
A few more pencil strokes would have helped.,49,32,15,96,529
It turns out that mountain climbing is 100% mental,54,33,17,104,529
Getting away from my wife. She thinks I'm delusional.,55,31,18,104,529
The hardest part is grappling with the unknown.,51,39,14,104,529
"I call it, ""Mime Every Mountain.""",54,33,17,104,529
Of course it's real - and Mexico paid for it.,52,25,18,95,529
Google Maps said this route was faster.,48,33,14,95,529
"Well, I started with Air Guitar and just sort of moved on from there.",54,36,16,106,529
The trick is not to learn too much about physics.,54,34,16,104,529
"Some see walls and ask ""why,"" I see no walls and ask ""why not""?",53,32,16,101,529
"Don't worry, I'm virtually there.",54,26,18,98,529
this is virtually impossible,50,34,14,98,529
I think I found the wall that Mexico paid for.,55,24,19,98,529
Because it's not there. That's why!,53,31,16,100,529
It's the only wall Mexico would pay for!,53,27,17,97,529
I'm not so sure about the emperor's new rock climbing wall.,53,30,16,99,529
I never question my GPS.,49,38,12,99,529
I also play air guitar.,52,28,16,96,529
Anything to get the hell out of Cleveland.,58,23,20,101,529
There was a glacier here when I started.,59,24,20,103,529
"Are you, by any chance, a cartoonist?",55,24,18,97,529
"Maybe you don't see it, but it's a beautiful wall and Mexico's paying for it.",55,20,19,94,529
Why do I want to climb it? Because it's not there.,52,29,15,96,529

Google Maps got me this far. I'm sticking with it.,50,35,12,97,529
I've moved on from air guitar.,53,29,15,97,529
Has the thought occurred to you that I'm actually falling?,58,19,20,97,529
"Yes, I have a safety rope, but I'm guessing you can't see that, either.",48,39,10,97,529
Just checking if the sky is really the limit.,52,31,14,97,529
Help! I've fallen up and I can't get down!,54,27,16,97,529
I'm afraid to let go.,49,33,12,94,529
I call it 'mind over Matterhorn',55,20,18,93,529

I like to call it mock climbing.,46,28,11,85,529
One of us is hallucinating!,52,33,12,97,529
You are literally driving me up a figurative wall.,55,27,15,97,529
These glaciers are disappearing even faster than I thought.,55,27,15,97,529
Don't just stand there. Draw some rocks!,51,28,13,92,529

I've always wanted to scale Mount Neverest.,51,24,14,89,529

"Obviously, he's drawing the mountain last.",52,25,13,90,529
"What do you mean by ""No visible means of Support""?",52,25,13,90,529
Why am I doing this? Because it's not there.,47,25,11,83,529
Sketch the darn rocks! I look like an idiot!,55,22,15,92,529

Just tell them to finish the damn drawing before I fall off the page.,48,18,13,79,529
Scaling Mont Blanc,49,29,10,88,529
Well of course there's no wall. He hasn't been elected yet.,54,22,14,90,529
It's the Emporer's new wall.,47,26,10,83,529
The mountain is metaphorical.,46,28,9,83,529
"Don't worry, I'm wearing a helmet.",49,22,12,83,529
"Hurry, draw the wall... DRAW THE WALL!",50,20,13,83,529
It's the same technique I use to run a hedge fund.,50,20,13,83,529
It's not what it looks like.,49,22,12,83,529
I'm taking an extreme mime class.,57,22,15,94,529
It's called extreme miming.,49,25,11,85,529
"Yes, it's my first time. Why..?",49,25,11,85,529
"So, if I have an imaginary fall, will it hurt?",48,27,10,85,529
I'm going where no man has gone before.,45,36,6,87,529
"Well, my ex tells me it's because I lack gravitas.",46,24,10,80,529
"It's ok, I am wearing a helmet!",48,20,12,80,529
It's more mental than anything.,48,26,10,84,529
Now THIS is what I call free climbing.,51,20,13,84,529
It's called Trump's Wall. You don't have to see it; you just have to believe it.,52,21,13,86,529
I like to visualize the climb before I make it.,46,36,6,88,529

My quest is to reach the height of transparency !,46,23,10,79,529

And you can only imagine the view at the top.,51,19,13,83,529
It's my final exam for Mime College.,50,21,12,83,529
"Let's call it Trump l'oeil: he can't build it, and I can't climb it!",54,16,15,85,529

"Air's pretty thick here in LA, isn't it?",47,20,11,78,529
"Help, I'm up and I can't get down!",47,26,9,82,529
This is the easy part. It's coming down that's hard.,48,24,10,82,529
The new trend is to climb it because it's NOT there,49,22,11,82,529
Quick! Turn the page sideways!,52,19,13,84,529
You clearly don't understand the Gravity of my Situation!!!,52,22,12,86,529
Draw a ladder!,54,18,14,86,529
This is the move that got me thrown out of mime school.,58,16,16,90,529
The Cloud now has a climbing app!,47,16,12,75,529
Glaciers sure do melt quickly these days.,49,18,12,79,529
It's firmer than Trump's grasp on reality.,53,10,16,79,529
"Mt. Mirage, it's never been climbed before.",49,18,12,79,529
Air guitar has lost its thrill.,48,23,10,81,529
Because it's here somewhere.,47,25,9,81,529
I think I'm losing my grip.,45,32,6,83,529
"Hey buddy, could you hand me that horizon line?",51,20,12,83,529

I have a Wall Climbing degree from Trump University.,50,18,12,80,529
"It's okay, there's a green screen.",47,24,9,80,529
Will you please stop telling me to get a grip!,48,25,9,82,529
I'm climbing the economic ladder. It's only visible to the 1%.,46,19,10,75,529
Climbing? There's nothing to it!,45,21,9,75,529
Anyone can mime being in a box.,47,17,11,75,529
It's just mind over anti-matter.,46,22,9,77,529
I'm more worried about coming down.,48,21,10,79,529
"Trust me, it's harder than it looks.",47,23,9,79,529
I'm drawing attention to vanishing glaciers.,49,19,11,79,529
"Well, it appears that I was wrong, and, yes, I would like a ladder.",46,25,8,79,529
Trump built it and the Mexicans paid for it.,52,13,14,79,529
How the fuck do I get out of the New Yorker?,51,15,13,79,529
I'm going up to meet my imaginary friend.,48,24,9,81,529
"Before you climb a mountain, you have to imagine yourself climbing the mountain.",50,20,11,81,529
Because it wasn't there - that's why.,52,16,13,81,529
It's the coming down that's really tricky.,48,30,7,85,529
"Stop saying ""get a grip.""",46,21,9,76,529
"My sherpa's name? ""Harvey."" Why?",47,19,10,76,529
It's called a rock miming wall.,46,21,9,76,529
Just inspecting the Emperor's new wall.,48,17,11,76,529
"Why? Well, because it's not there ...",46,24,8,78,529
"This is hard enough without you staring at me, sir.",47,22,9,78,529
Quick. Someone draw a rope.,48,20,10,78,529
"Listen, pal, anybody can climb mountains because they're there...",49,18,11,78,529
Why did I climb it? Because it's not there.,49,18,11,78,529
It's called suspended disbelief...,46,27,7,80,529
"The secret is to not look down...or up, or out, or sideways.",47,25,8,80,529
I didn't think the glacier would recede so quickly.,41,18,8,67,529
Glaciers disappear so quickly these days.,42,25,6,73,529
"Yes. I am wearing Virtual Realty Googles, why do you ask?",45,19,9,73,529
I learned climbing from Marcel Marceau.,45,19,9,73,529
Quick -- someone get this guy some more ink!,44,21,8,73,529
I'm off to find the Cloud.,47,18,10,75,529
I'm uploading to the cloud.,46,20,9,75,529
This is actually a lot harder than it looks.,40,32,3,75,529
It's 90 percent mental,43,26,6,75,529
"Quick, draw me some rocks!",44,24,7,75,529
I'm free climbing.,44,27,6,77,529
I'm losing my grip on reality!,46,23,8,77,529
"That settles it, no more Ambien for me.",45,25,7,77,529
It's all about having the right shoes.,45,25,7,77,529
I'm getting nowhere.,43,29,5,77,529
"Hey Buddy, do me a favor. Grab a pencil and draw me a ladder!",51,13,13,77,529
These Air Jordans are amazing,49,17,11,77,529
And I'm burning 55 virtual calories,43,29,5,77,529
"I'm going to wake up in a minute, can you call an ambulance please?",49,17,11,77,529
I believe in 100% transparency.,46,26,7,79,529
The trick is not to look down.,46,26,7,79,529
Why climb it? Because it's not there.,50,18,11,79,529
"It's called ""extreme pantomime.""",50,24,9,83,529
I do it because it's not there.,46,19,9,74,529
Imagine harder.,46,19,9,74,529
I was valedictorian of my mime class.,47,14,11,72,529
Draw me a wall! Quick!,43,28,5,76,529
It's getting back down that's the tricky part.,47,20,9,76,529
It's a virtual wall.,46,19,9,74,529
The thing about being a cartoon is that you won't fall unless you look down.,48,18,10,76,529
"Ok, now draw me a ladder",44,29,5,78,529
Gravity is just a social construct.,47,20,9,76,529
Let's see Marcelle Marceau do this!,47,23,8,78,529
I'll be okay as soon as I find the rest of the cartoon.,49,16,11,76,529
The secret is not looking down.,47,17,10,74,529
Why? Because it's air.,48,21,9,78,529
Um...You are going to need to show me the ropes.,44,26,6,76,529
It's hard to climb in white out conditions.,49,16,11,76,529
So you climbed THIS one because it WASN'T there?,51,17,11,79,529
Mexico wouldn't pay for it.,50,19,10,79,529
I've told you! Because it isn't there!,51,17,11,79,529
Tell the guy who's drawing the mountain to hurry up.,52,15,12,79,529
I used to play air guitar.,49,18,10,77,529
It's the latest in fitness -- air conditioning.,50,16,11,77,529
I'm uploading files to the cloud.,52,12,13,77,529
Before I was a rock climber I was a mime.,48,20,9,77,529
I can't tell if you're high or I am.,48,17,10,75,529
I swear there's a Pokemon up here.,47,19,9,75,529
Sometimes I find it difficult to get a grip!,47,19,9,75,529
You'll see it when you believe it.,47,19,9,75,529
I'm gonna be the first man to climb Mt. Neverest.,46,18,9,73,529
Because it is virtually there.,44,22,7,73,529
Getting down is the hard part.,46,18,9,73,529
The last thing I remember was volunteering to be hypnotised.,47,16,10,73,529
Now is NOT the time to tell me it's all in my head doc.,47,16,10,73,529
I'm taking a virtual climbing class.,47,16,10,73,529
It's a lot easier coming down,44,22,7,73,529
Quick! Tell Sipress to draw a rope!,45,17,9,71,529
"If you climb it, it will come.",43,21,7,71,529
I just don't seem to be getting much traction.,45,17,9,71,529
I'm climbing the Trump wall. Nothing but hot air and bluster.,52,17,11,80,529
The stock market does it. Why shouldn't I?,52,14,12,78,529
I'm drawn to scale.,49,17,10,76,529
