"Yeah, we're in town for the manger scene.",93,31,17,141,641,3121
I guess it wasn't a dream after all.,93,31,17,141,641,6361
Hello Amazon? I think there's been some mistake. I ordered a dozen sheets.,109,36,20,165,641,128
You tell me the insomniac's room number...I send the sheep.,96,42,14,152,641,1820
"It's like this, Bo-Peep, $25,000 in old unmarked bills or you will never see them again",99,36,17,152,641,5216
"...good news, Ms. Peep...I found your sheep.",100,34,18,152,641,8549

We're watching ewe tube.,104,31,20,155,641,2756
"Twelve green salads, no dressing.",100,39,16,155,641,7281

"On the upside, I haven't seen a wolf all day.",85,26,16,127,641,1592
"Not much, just getting in the mood to watch a Trump Rally.",103,24,22,149,641,4943
I told Alexa I needed more SLEEP.,101,28,20,149,641,5780
"Not bad, but the dog's still working on getting the last couple into the elevator.",109,29,22,160,641,8263

This is the last time I order a wool coat from IKEA.,99,26,20,145,641,2598
Lost the farm. Staying with my son and his wife.,96,32,17,145,641,5050
Sheets! I asked for fresh sheets!,106,29,21,156,641,811
"I wanted a cheap hotel, not a sheep hotel.",115,28,24,167,641,8047
I decided to work from home today.,92,37,14,143,641,606
Me?... holding an offsite staff meeting.,115,42,19,176,641,1596
Yes we can help treat insomnia.,102,34,18,154,641,2500
You always herd the ones you love.,121,44,20,185,641,852
Don't be so dramatic. It's called shared custody and you know where to find them,116,37,21,174,641,4341
No...I said “send up more SHEETS”,104,27,21,152,641,529
...and I'll have the shepherd's pie.,101,33,18,152,641,7314

how many manger scenes are we looking at?,108,30,21,159,641,4350
What size does the sweater need to be ?,98,33,17,148,641,1291
"Let me call you back, I'm just in a staff meeting right now.",93,43,12,148,641,6684
"Yes, one medium pepperoni mushroom and a dozen side salads...",109,42,17,168,641,3475
So I finally one-upped that urban farmer who lives next door.,86,23,17,126,641,3888
...and I wonder why I'm single,104,35,18,157,641,3920
"But Dad, I have a job.",103,37,17,157,641,7597
I think it's time for me to move to greener pastures.,95,36,15,146,641,7365
... and do you allow pets?,91,27,17,135,641,283
I couldn't sleep so we're watching a movie.,93,23,19,135,641,1396
"Yeah, I'm trying out this new “work from home” option",105,30,20,155,641,8346

Just wait until the cows come home.,104,40,16,160,641,2916
I don’t know how many. I get to 10 and I’m out.,108,46,15,169,641,24
Yes..I'd like the shepherd's pie. For twelve.,113,33,21,167,641,2194

Me? I’m just at a gathering of Trump supporters.  And what are you up to?,101,26,20,147,641,6898
I have a question about the new sleep app.,100,28,19,147,641,8172
No problem. We're watching the Rams game.,114,45,17,176,641,666
Yeah. I started with dog-walking and things just kind of took off from there.,104,34,18,156,641,3258
We’ve lost our way.,112,32,21,165,641,865

"I was skeptical at first, but I got to say, I'm really starting to enjoy this working from home thing.",94,31,16,141,641,7790
"I like the new gig, except when they ask me to take work home.",100,33,17,150,641,2433
My lease said no cats or dogs,105,37,17,159,641,360
Tell Mr. Trump I have just arrived with a group of his most devoted supporters and we look forward to meeting him.,114,33,21,168,641,8447
Apartment living really IS easier; I haven’t lost a single one.,91,34,14,139,641,4263
"The lease said no dogs,nothing about sheep.",102,40,15,157,641,1084
$500 on the Rams. I have inside information.,102,40,15,157,641,5342
Another insomnia case? I'll be right there.,107,30,20,157,641,5941
I just want to inquire about how many comfort animals you allow me to take on my flight?,102,40,15,157,641,7452
"Front desk?  I thought you said ""CHEAP ROOM"" .",107,30,20,157,641,8595

"I would tell you how many, but I might nod off.",107,44,15,166,641,3849
Damned if it didn't work.  I left them alone.  They came home.,116,40,19,175,641,8554
Not much. Brought some work home with me.,87,39,11,137,641,8171
"…yeah, the real trick is finding something they all want to watch.",98,31,17,146,641,1783
I told the condo board I worked in commodities.,102,37,16,155,641,90
"I'm not sure how many there are.  Every time I try to count them, I fall asleep!",118,33,22,173,641,4133
The Rams are up by 3 points; you wouldn't believe the tension in the room.,98,42,13,153,641,1482
"I'm not sure if it's from the counting or the tending, but I'm definitely sleeping better.",96,46,11,153,641,1932
"No, not ""you"", I said I have a problem with ""ewes"".",95,34,15,144,641,6757

"No, I said I could use more _sleep_.",114,46,16,176,641,6647
That’s right — a large cheese pizza and a border collie.,108,30,20,158,641,1490
It's honestly far superior to urban beekeeping.,97,38,14,149,641,2009
"Well, I told them the grass wasn’t always greener but they wanted to see for themselves.",98,36,15,149,641,3015
This isn't working. I need to go back on Ambien.,117,37,20,174,641,4186

"Hello, Tavern on the Green? I'd like to reserve just the Green for dinner tonight.",103,37,16,156,641,6213
It always seemed unfair that I got to see where they live but they never got to see my place.,95,39,13,147,641,6519
They’re my emotional support flock.,91,33,14,138,641,8406
Can't.  I'm watching the Rams play tonight.,119,30,23,172,641,328
I think sleeping pills may have been the more practical option.,99,42,13,154,641,1616
"That’s right, 3 fish tacos, a diet coke , and 50 bales of hay.",103,34,17,154,641,3045
Every time I try to count them I fall asleep,94,38,13,145,641,6227

"That’s right, I’m working from home today.",113,44,16,173,641,6465

"A hamburger, fries, and 12 bales of clover.",92,44,10,146,641,3836
"Fine so far, the escalator was a bit of a problem.",105,43,14,162,641,832
You said no dogs.,109,35,18,162,641,4090
