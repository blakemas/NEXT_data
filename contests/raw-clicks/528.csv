Welcome to Weight Watchers!,25,7,10,42,528
We're here today to discuss firing the architect.,19,17,4,40,528
This meeting is getting away from me.,22,7,8,37,528
I am entertaining a motion to evacuate. Do I hear a second?,23,12,7,42,528
The captain assures me it was a very small iceberg.,23,9,7,39,528
Welcome to orientation.,21,13,5,39,528
Many of you are concerned with the direction our company is heading.,22,11,6,39,528
Can someone straighten out that picture?,21,13,5,39,528
"Well, maybe now you will appreciate the gravity of the situation.",24,8,7,39,528
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.,24,8,7,39,528
I see we have reached the tipping point.,23,6,7,36,528
"As you may have guessed, I've highly leveraged the company.",21,10,5,36,528
"It can't be that bad, the band's still playing.",22,8,6,36,528
Can anyone bring something to the table?,20,15,3,38,528
"First, I'd like to thank you all for not joining the lawsuit against my brother's architectural firm...",23,9,6,38,528
This meeting of the Fox News editorial board will now come to order.,23,9,6,38,528
Everyone seated around this table has an equal vote.,20,5,6,31,528
The Architectural Standards Committee meeting will now come to order.,22,7,6,35,528
"Obviously, we've reached a tipping point.",19,13,3,35,528
"So, other than the wheels, we like the new chairs?",21,12,4,37,528
Now...Let's see what this button does.,23,8,6,37,528
"From where I'm sitting, it's all downhill from here.",23,8,6,37,528
I want to level with you all...,22,6,6,34,528
What's it going to take to bring you all to the table?,22,6,6,34,528
"Unless I get a volunteer, I’m going to let go of this table.",22,6,6,34,528
"OK, I'll level with you.",21,11,4,36,528
I see the weight of my argument has failed to move you in my direction.,23,6,6,35,528
We appear to have reached the tipping point.,23,6,6,35,528
The rumors are true. We are a sinking ship.,22,8,5,35,528
"Before we begin, I'd just like to point out that Mr. Gehry was very highly recommended.",22,7,5,34,528
"On second thought, maybe rolling chairs were a bad idea.",22,7,5,34,528
"So, then -- all in favor of removing the wheels from our chairs, say 'aye.'d",24,5,6,35,528
Welcome to the Pisa branch offices.,23,7,5,35,528
"Unlike you, I do appreciate the gravity of the situation.",22,6,5,33,528
So its unanimous?,21,8,4,33,528
"Is it just me, or does that picture seem crooked?",19,12,2,33,528
I think I know which way the group is leaning.,23,6,5,34,528
The motion to adjourn has been approved by a landslide.,21,10,3,34,528
Do I need to remind you what rolls downhill?,23,6,5,34,528
"When the OSHA guy gets here, everyone look casual.",22,8,4,34,528
"Yes, it's unsinkable. Any other questions?",22,8,4,34,528
Red rover red rover send Sandi on over,24,4,6,34,528
It appears that the discussion has tilted in my favor.,23,3,6,32,528
"My name is John, I am an alcoholic...and an architect...",20,9,3,32,528
Welcome to New Balance.,24,1,7,32,528
"Well, Bill, it looks like you won because of a landslide.",19,8,3,30,528
Of course it's not a level playing field. Duh!,22,7,4,33,528
I'm here to assure you that fracking does not cause seismic events.,22,7,4,33,528
"Oh my God, it does not smell that bad.",22,4,5,31,528
Let's move on to the next slide.,22,4,5,31,528
"Clearly, groupthink does not lend itself to a balanced solution.",20,8,3,31,528
I think we're too far to the right on this.,22,4,5,31,528
That's ridiculous Evelyn! Does anyone else feel I talk down to you?,20,8,3,31,528
First order of business: we fire the architect.,20,8,3,31,528
We're selling the engineering division.,20,8,3,31,528
I want to begin by saying the foundation of this company is as solid as ever.,20,8,3,31,528
It appears the balance of power has shifted.,23,2,6,31,528
"So exactly how long have things been going downhill?""",20,8,3,31,528
"Ok, so no one is on my side.",20,5,4,29,528
I move that we table the motion.,18,6,3,27,528
"As you all know, moving up in this company can be difficult.",23,7,4,34,528
I'm beginning to see the gravity of the situation.,22,6,4,32,528
Maybe I came on a little strong there.,23,4,5,32,528
Guess what rolls downhill?,22,6,4,32,528
Who's got the bowling ball?,21,8,3,32,528
I just wanted to give you my slant on the company's future.,21,8,3,32,528
We have to stop meeting like this.,22,6,4,32,528
Anyone know who put a lien on this building?,20,7,3,30,528
Lunch should be here shortly. I ordered sliders.,20,7,3,30,528
So moved?,20,7,3,30,528
For our next Board meeting I believe we should seriously consider using TeleMeeting rather than a cruise ship.,22,3,5,30,528
All in favor of suing the architect...,19,9,2,30,528
"Before we get started, would someone straighten the picture?",19,9,2,30,528
We have to stop having our board meetings on cruise lines.,23,1,6,30,528
I'll keep my presentation brief because I know you all hate slides.,20,7,3,30,528
Very funny guys. Now straighten the picture and move your chairs back to the table.,20,7,3,30,528
Watch what happens when I let go of this table.,20,7,3,30,528
Now you understand why our new cologne isn't selling.,21,5,4,30,528
Another uphill battle?,19,9,2,30,528
"Not so long ago, I was sitting where you people are.",20,7,3,30,528
I don't roll that way,19,9,2,30,528
"So, now you understand the gravity of the situation.",20,4,4,28,528
I want you all to know you can always come to me.,19,6,3,28,528
I'm inclined to say no.,21,10,2,33,528
"A simple ""nay"" vote would have sufficed.",20,9,2,31,528
I want to address the rumors that this company is crooked.,22,5,4,31,528
I grant you. Locating our headquarters on the San Andreas fault has some disadvantages.,20,9,2,31,528
Vote 'yes' or I let go of the table.,23,3,5,31,528
Anyone see my pen down there?,20,9,2,31,528
I think we can agree that the company is a little heavy in upper management.,23,3,5,31,528
I'm sure you're aware of the gravity of the situation.,19,11,1,31,528
The motion to abandon ship passes unanimously.,21,7,3,31,528
Company benefits will be given on a sliding scale.,23,3,5,31,528
"Here, on the Titanic, there are no dumb questions.",18,10,1,29,528
It seems your opinion outweighs my logic.,20,6,3,29,528
I'm just hoping Frank Gehry will give us a partial refund.,20,6,3,29,528
It is still the view of the board that the ship is not sinking.,19,8,2,29,528
So now let us adjourn to the life boats.,19,8,2,29,528
"On the plus side, it has a wonderful view of downtown Pisa.",20,6,3,29,528
Now let me get this straight . . .,20,6,3,29,528
The motion is carried by a landslide,19,8,2,29,528
"As luck would have it, our next agenda item is a report from Building Maintenance.",20,6,3,29,528
It seems the builder didn't level with us.,20,6,3,29,528
"We are facing an uphill battle, but I would like to get rolling.",21,4,4,29,528
"As some of you may have noticed, the company is in decline.",19,8,2,29,528
There's been a seismic shift in our firm's outlook.,21,4,4,29,528
Why don't we try another angle?,18,7,2,27,528
"Sorry, but I'm inclined to disagree.",18,7,2,27,528
"Because the rent is cheap, and would someone crawl up here and help me hold the table?",19,5,3,27,528
"'First, welcome to Pisa.'",18,7,2,27,528
To save money we had to let about half of the 34th floor go.,23,5,4,32,528
"Seriously, is there an elephant in the room?",21,6,3,30,528
"First of all, I would like to welcome you to Sisyphus Corporation.",22,4,4,30,528
Pull up a chair!,21,6,3,30,528
The market slide was more severe than we had anticipated,20,8,2,30,528
You're in no position to negotiate; things have tilted in my favor!,21,6,3,30,528
"Alright, second my motion, or I let the table go.",20,8,2,30,528
"Let's put it to a vote then - All in favor of Mary's proposal to install seatbelts in the restroom, say aye.",20,8,2,30,528
I think we've reached a tipping point.,20,8,2,30,528
This company is moving in a new direction.,19,10,1,30,528
I would like to address the rumors of instability in this company.,21,6,3,30,528
"First, let me welcome you all to Pisa.",22,4,4,30,528
Let me try and put this into perspective.,19,10,1,30,528
"Okay, who hired the architect?",19,10,1,30,528
"It will cost too much to straighten the building, so we are just going to take the wheels off the chairs.",21,6,3,30,528
I think we're at the tipping point.,22,4,4,30,528
You've all been hired to right this ship.,22,4,4,30,528
And we can begin the meeting as soon as SOMEONE starts holding the magazine straight.,20,8,2,30,528
Maybe Gehry wasn't the best choice for the interior.,21,6,3,30,528
I'm sure you can all appreciate the gravity of our current situation.,22,4,4,30,528
It would seem that I have the table.,21,6,3,30,528
My cartoonist has been drinking again,20,8,2,30,528
I trust you all understand the gravity of the situation.,20,8,2,30,528
I'd like to address the allegations that our reporting leans to the right.,22,4,4,30,528
It looks like the balance of power has shifted.,21,6,3,30,528
All in favor of moving lifeboat aquisition out of sub-committee?,22,4,4,30,528
Now it will be easier to talk down to you,21,3,4,28,528
So it’s unanimous: The wheels are coming off the chairs.,21,3,4,28,528
In order to keep this company on an even keel I'm going to have to throw some of you overboard.,19,7,2,28,528
Show of hands: fix the foundation or remove the wheels from the chairs.,22,1,5,28,528
I didn't literally mean heads need to roll.,19,7,2,28,528
I promise to keep this meeting brief since we're short on time and the ship is about to go down...,20,5,3,28,528
"Before we start, can someone straighten that picture?",19,7,2,28,528
Who can tell me why this painting is tilted?,21,3,4,28,528
Didn't anyone think that hiring my brother-in-law to build this building was a bad idea?,19,7,2,28,528
Did anyone bring a Slinky?,20,5,3,28,528
I see you're all inclined to disagree.,18,9,1,28,528
"First, let me address the rumors that the company is foundering.",20,5,3,28,528
Alright. Who moved the white board?,20,5,3,28,528
Welcome to the Ayn Rand Institute!,20,5,3,28,528
Only now may we fully appreciate the gravity of our situation.,19,7,2,28,528
I'd appreciate it if you would just level with me.,20,5,3,28,528
I appear to be the only one that understands the gravity of this situation.,20,5,3,28,528
"My previous coworkers entertained a very different definition of ""contagious""",20,5,3,28,528
"All those in favor of removing the wheels from their chair, say aye.",19,7,2,28,528
All I'm asking is for you to look at it from my angle.,21,3,4,28,528
This conversation seems a little one-sided.,20,5,3,28,528
". . .and for most of you, the road to success will be an uphill battle.",19,7,2,28,528
"All right, OK... I'll level with you.",20,5,3,28,528
To get to this position was an uphill battle.,20,5,3,28,528
Let me welcome you to Form Over Function Architects LLC.,20,5,3,28,528
I move to table the question and let it slide.,19,7,2,28,528
Don't everyone volunteer at once.,20,5,3,28,528
New business: I propose we get rid of these wheely chairs.,22,6,3,31,528
I'm inclined to agree.,23,4,4,31,528
Some of you may be wondering if the Board is properly balanced.,23,4,4,31,528
"I never talk down to people, if I can help it. I can't help it.",23,4,4,31,528
I get the sense that the whole room is leaning towards one decision.,23,4,4,31,528
I think we can all appreciate the gravity of the situation.,23,4,4,31,528
"The first item on our ""new employee orientation"" agenda is this little exercise in orientation.",22,6,3,31,528
Will someone please straighten the picture?,19,12,0,31,528
It's obvious this company is in a steep decline.,22,6,3,31,528
I can see which way the room is leaning on this one.,23,4,4,31,528
Raise your hand if you think Frank Gehry is overrated.,22,6,3,31,528
What do you mean I let you down?,18,6,2,26,528
I need to keep my distance as I read the will.,19,4,3,26,528
Level playing fields are for losers.,20,2,4,26,528
"Welcome, National Council on Astigmatism.",22,3,4,29,528
I'm glad you all appreciate the gravity of this situation.,21,5,3,29,528
So now that you appreciate the gravity of our situation...,19,9,1,29,528
"We must right this ship, people...",19,9,1,29,528
"Okay, so marbles are out. Any other thoughts?",21,5,3,29,528
I'm concerned that getting everyone to the table might be an uphill battle.,20,7,2,29,528
I never promised you a level playing field,20,7,2,29,528
I just don't think you understand the gravity of the situation!,21,5,3,29,528
All I said was Trump is not that bad.,22,3,4,29,528
"Alright then, you balance the budget.",20,7,2,29,528
I presume you now understand the gravity of the situation.,22,3,4,29,528
"I said ""Eureka"" not ""I've got Zika"".",23,1,5,29,528
Perhaps we shouldn't have opened an office in Pisa.,21,5,3,29,528
"In the future, a simple ""nay"" would be sufficient.",20,7,2,29,528
Tell me why I shouldn't just let go of this table.,20,7,2,29,528
Hopefully you all now see the gravity of the situation.,20,7,2,29,528
"Ok, so moving offshore does have some drawbacks.",20,7,2,29,528
I can clearly see the gravity of the situation.,20,7,2,29,528
I see my opinion doesn't carry much weight.,21,5,3,29,528
I'm inclined to feel the same as all of you.,21,5,3,29,528
Looks like the nays have it.,21,5,3,29,528
"In hindsight, the three-bean chili for lunch wasn't the best idea.",22,3,4,29,528

I'm sure you appreciate the gravity of the situation.,21,2,4,27,528
I expect you all to work at full-tilt.,19,6,2,27,528
I don't think you all fully appreciate the gravity of our situation...,21,2,4,27,528
I hope you appreciate the gravity of our situation.,19,6,2,27,528
"Like the job description said, we're looking for a candidate who is upwardly mobile.",19,6,2,27,528
Our world has shifted and we must respond.,19,6,2,27,528
Any suggestions on how to level the playing field?,21,2,4,27,528
Now do you see the gravity of the situation?,19,6,2,27,528

"All those in favor of keeping the roller chairs, vote aye",21,2,4,27,528
"Yes, we pay on a sliding scale.",19,6,2,27,528
Before we begin I would like to get something straight.,18,8,1,27,528
Did I promise you a level playing field?,19,6,2,27,528
I think we know which way the Board is leaning...,19,6,2,27,528
"This board decision may tilt in your favor, but as chair I may still decide to crush you with this table.",20,4,3,27,528
I'm inclined to let it slide.,18,8,1,27,528
"As you know, the company appears to be headed downhill.",21,2,4,27,528
It has come to my attention that adaptive reuse of an old fun house may not have been the best option for our office relocation.,19,6,2,27,528
"So, who wants to level the playing field?",19,6,2,27,528
All those in favor of adding brakes to our chairs...,19,6,2,27,528
I told you not to straighten the picture frame!,22,5,3,30,528

"Here, you will need to claw your way to the top.",20,6,2,28,528
"When they said ""restructuring,"" I didn't think they meant the building.",21,4,3,28,528
I know it looks like an uphill battle but...,19,8,1,28,528
I'm afraid we're going to have to make some structural changes.,20,6,2,28,528
I hope you all understand the gravity of this situation.,18,10,0,28,528
It appears the market has shifted.,20,6,2,28,528
I'm sure you all realize the gravity of the situation.,20,6,2,28,528
OK! So I had garlic shrimp for lunch ......,20,6,2,28,528

I see you have the majority in your corner.,20,5,2,27,528
The architect did mention that there was a minor glitch in the plans...,19,7,1,27,528
I should've had a V8.,21,3,3,27,528

I had this room built to make a point.,19,7,1,27,528
Any suggestions for addressing the silly rumor that the economy is tilted in favor of us one-percenters?,20,5,2,27,528

This is exactly what I meant when I said we have to level the field.,21,8,1,30,528
Now that you understand the gravity of the situation . . .,19,7,1,27,528
It appears the board is not leaning in my favor.,20,5,2,27,528
I’ve been letting some things slide recently.,20,5,2,27,528
So that's how we roll,20,5,2,27,528
I am still not inclined to take your proposal,18,4,2,24,528
I'm leaning that direction too.,19,7,1,27,528
Not only is the rent cheaper but the building has great drainage,21,3,3,27,528

"In San Francisco, we like to proceed as if nothing's happened.",21,8,1,30,528
I'd like to give you a different slant on the problem,20,5,2,27,528

I wanted to make sure we started with your backs against the wall,22,3,3,28,528

"I said raise your hand, not hands",20,2,3,25,528
I am getting the feeling you are not with me on this!,18,6,1,25,528
Anyone have a breath mint?,19,4,2,25,528
You think my opinions are skewed?,20,2,3,25,528
No even one of you has anything to bring to the table?,19,4,2,25,528
Ok. So maybe we do need to deal with that sink hole in the parking lot.,19,4,2,25,528
Now you can't deny that things are looking up.,19,4,2,25,528

I get it. Your work-life balance is off.,19,4,2,25,528
"As you may have noticed, our company has gone downhill.",19,4,2,25,528
Seven architects and not one of you noticed the window was crooked?,20,2,3,25,528

Now try to table my motion!,18,8,0,26,528
"I don't know how, but I'm trying to level with you.",19,6,1,26,528
Why do I feel like the only one to grasp the levity of the situation?,19,6,1,26,528
I'm afraid the market slide was more far-reaching than we anticipated.,20,4,2,26,528

Maybe we should stop thinking outside the box,19,6,1,26,528
You will be evaluated on a sliding scale,19,6,1,26,528
There's a motion that we become a standing committee.,20,4,2,26,528
"'' After Ms. Davenport's presentation, we're having sliders for lunch.''",20,4,2,26,528

"I'm sorry, but now that the bank has placed a lean on the building, I have no choice but to let all of you go.",19,6,1,26,528
These shipboard meetings seem to be driving us apart.,20,4,2,26,528
I take that as disapproval of the proposed sliding pay scale.,21,2,3,26,528
Our sales department has really gone downhill.,20,4,2,26,528

All those in favor of leaving the building now...,19,3,2,24,528
Good Job People! It's all down hill from here!,19,3,2,24,528
Perhaps we should look at this from another angle.,17,7,0,24,528
I sense the board is already leaning one way on this issue.,18,5,1,24,528
I see you all grasp the gravity of the situation.,19,3,2,24,528
I want to impress upon you the gravity of our situation.,18,5,1,24,528

How dare you accuse me of not leveling with you!,19,5,1,25,528

It took an earthquake to prove that the self-leveling picture frame works!,19,5,1,25,528
Now that you understand the gravity of this situation...,19,5,1,25,528
I beg your pardon; your comments were a bit off-centered.,19,5,1,25,528
And salaries will obviously be on a sliding scale.,20,3,2,25,528
I was really hoping for your support on this.,20,3,2,25,528

I'm glad you see the gravity of this situation.,19,5,1,25,528
I'm sensing a subtle power shift within the group.,20,3,2,25,528
Try looking at it from my point of view,20,3,2,25,528
Sorry about that. I had chili for lunch.,20,3,2,25,528
Looks like the balance of power has taken an interesting turn.,21,1,3,25,528
Just think of this as a zero sum game.,20,3,2,25,528
Can I presume you are all Republicans?,20,3,2,25,528
At least they hung the window properly,18,7,0,25,528

Try to see this from my angle...,18,7,0,25,528
You all have equal rights. In this company we take pride in offering a level playing field.,20,3,2,25,528
Now---which one of you is the architect?,19,5,1,25,528
Today we will be discussing a new floor plan.,18,7,0,25,528

Does that painting look crooked to you?,19,5,1,25,528
Welcome to our first corporate retreat at sea. Any questions?,19,5,1,25,528
I don't think you people are on the level with me.,19,5,1,25,528
One of the many reasons I nail my feet to the floor.,18,7,0,25,528
"We're on a roll, people!",20,3,2,25,528
The figures for the second quarter are titanic.,20,3,2,25,528
Try to see it from my perspective: I'm not looking down on you. You're looking up to me!,20,3,2,25,528
"Simon says, roll back to the table.",20,3,2,25,528
I'm aware that this focus group skews to the right.,20,3,2,25,528
I'd call this a landslide.,19,5,1,25,528
Admit it. You've let things slide.,20,3,2,25,528
"Okay, this meeting is going downhill fast",20,3,2,25,528
"Yes, I’m the architect. What seems to be the problem?",19,5,1,25,528
"Before we get down to business, Where are we with finding a new architect?",20,3,2,25,528
So what you're saying is our engineering issues are also a metaphor for something?,20,3,2,25,528
"Tell you what, I'm willing to meet you half-way",18,7,0,25,528
Who seconds the motion for wheelless chairs?,20,3,2,25,528
You all seriously need to lean-in.,20,3,2,25,528
Will someone please throw me back my pen?,20,3,2,25,528
I just want to quash the rumors that this company is a sinking ship.,19,5,1,25,528
"Now that we have established the appropriate balance of power, we may commence our meeting.",19,5,1,25,528
What do you mean 'level playing field?',19,5,1,25,528

Fair enough. But you can't beat the rent on this place!,20,3,2,25,528
I suggest we adjourn before we hit the next wave,19,5,1,25,528
It's not too late to change your vote.,20,3,2,25,528

"I want to assure all of you,I intend to manage with a level playing field.",19,5,1,25,528
I know you all probably feel like you're on a slippery slope here.,19,5,1,25,528
"On the other hand,upper management will be fine.",20,3,2,25,528
Thank God for walls.,19,5,1,25,528
Today's study group seems a bit one-sided.,18,7,0,25,528
One false move and I'll let go of the table,20,3,2,25,528
So much for your office coup.,19,5,1,25,528
I think you all understand the gravity of the situation.,19,5,1,25,528
"In conclusion, let me assure the board that this business is in no way a sinking ship.",19,5,1,25,528
....I know things have been going down hill lately....,18,7,0,25,528
I wanted to give you a different slant on things,20,3,2,25,528
I know some of you are wondering how you got on the list.,19,5,1,25,528
So somebody tell me why you all think we've tilted too far to the right.,19,5,1,25,528
"In hindsight, we should have just re-framed the window.",20,3,2,25,528
C'mon guys. Do we have to do this every time I need a volunteer?,19,5,1,25,528
Cheapest office space in all of Pisa. and this board room is huge!,19,5,1,25,528
I'm still not changing our name! We worked hard branding San Andreas.,19,5,1,25,528
Well I'm glad to see that at least you all can appreciate the gravity of our situation.,19,5,1,25,528

"Just because I'm the boss' son, don't think that things are tilted in my favor.",19,5,1,25,528
I wish you would level with me.,20,3,2,25,528
I've lost control of the room.,19,5,1,25,528
I wouldn't call it push back.,19,5,1,25,528
Corporately we believe all crap rolls down hill.,18,7,0,25,528
Perhaps... but the rest of the news networks are all slanted the other way.,19,5,1,25,528
WHAT flows downhill?,18,2,2,22,528

Is it the room or my breath?,20,5,1,26,528
"Despite all our efforts to level the playing field, we've decided to go the other way.",21,3,2,26,528
Not just our stock is sliding,20,5,1,26,528
You got the drift?,20,5,1,26,528
Our customers must be convinced that we're on the level.,20,5,1,26,528
I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.,20,5,1,26,528
You don't appreciate the gravity of the situation.,20,5,1,26,528
I truly believe your point of view is skewed.,20,5,1,26,528
"Did you say something about a slippery slope, Evelyn?",19,7,0,26,528
This more accurately represents the corporate balance of power.,21,3,2,26,528

Before we start ... Barclay can you straighten the mirror?,20,5,1,26,528
I don't think you understand the gravity of this decision,20,5,1,26,528
I'll make this candid and short. Our company is a sinking ship.,21,3,2,26,528
"Remember people, a rising tide doesn't lift all boats.",19,7,0,26,528
"And next, the bonuses for the Building Committee.",20,5,1,26,528
I believe we need to fire the architect.,20,5,1,26,528
First order of business: let's change these castor-wheels with some sticky rubber feet. Second order of business: let's fire our architects.,20,5,1,26,528
It's called trickle-down ergonomics.,21,3,2,26,528
...and that is why I think I'd be a great fit at the Acme Seesaw Company.,20,5,1,26,528
"Let's get this straight, balancing the budget is just part of the problem....",21,3,2,26,528
"With a little time, I'm confident you'll all come my way.",22,1,3,26,528

I still think California was a good choice for our headquarters.,20,5,1,26,528
This meeting seems to be going downhill.,20,5,1,26,528
First one that catches it gets the promotion,21,3,2,26,528
I see the room has shifted.,19,7,0,26,528
"From your perspective, things are looking up!",22,1,3,26,528
No need to vote then since you are all so inclined.,19,7,0,26,528
I'm leaning towards agreeing with you,20,5,1,26,528
I sense a slight shift.,21,3,2,26,528
"Actually, it's the camera and the window that's slanted.",21,3,2,26,528
I want everyone to try to come to the table on this.,20,5,1,26,528
Stay right there and with a little luck the aftershock will slide you right back to your places.,20,5,1,26,528
"""Yeah... Well, this is not a playing field!",19,7,0,26,528
We are not going to let this slide.,20,5,1,26,528
"And when you say 'leaning way too much to the right,' do you mean in the political context?",22,1,3,26,528
As if to prove my point that too many on our team have become dead weight...,21,3,2,26,528
Once again I regret getting office space in a Frank Gehry building.,19,7,0,26,528
"If you feel like victims of bias now, just wait 'til I let go of this table.",21,3,2,26,528
"If any of you oppose, I will literally crush you.",21,3,2,26,528

I hope you all understand the gravity of our situation.,20,5,1,26,528
I am so glad we moved our office to Pisa.,21,3,2,26,528
"Before I let go of this table, I want you all to know how much I have appreciated working with you.",20,5,1,26,528
"No, you can't sit at the conference table, we've eliminated middle management.",21,3,2,26,528
Like our profits.,21,3,2,26,528
Why didn't anybody bring anything to the table worth discussing?,19,7,0,26,528
"The bad news is the the tide has turned.""... The good news is Surf's Up.",20,5,1,26,528
The listing did say that relocating to a 'low cost business tower' in Pisa has it's ups and downs,20,5,1,26,528
"I think if the rest of you take the wheels off your chairs, we can resume the meeting.",20,5,1,26,528
Not until we figure out who's passing gas!,21,3,2,26,528
"Yes, the rumors are true. We've pivoted.",20,5,1,26,528
First one who makes it to this end of the table gets the corner office.,21,3,2,26,528
How many of you know how to swim?,21,3,2,26,528
I'm afraid I misunderstood when you said we need a new slant on the way we do our staff meetings.,21,3,2,26,528
Would you say this company treats men and women the same?,20,5,1,26,528
What a great game of air hockey! Who's up for some ping pong?,20,5,1,26,528
I always knew our board of directors carried a lot of weight.,20,5,1,26,528
"Okay, me next--ready?",20,5,1,26,528
First order of business; let's fix that window.,21,3,2,26,528
All rise.,20,5,1,26,528
Did anyone else feel that quake?,21,3,2,26,528
I want to know which one of you contracted out the building renovations and I want to know now.,21,3,2,26,528
we need to level with each other...,20,5,1,26,528
This chair will oppose any unanimous descent until the table is motioned!,21,3,2,26,528
We need to work on levelling the playing field.,19,7,0,26,528
Can somebody straighten that picture frame?,21,3,2,26,528
You realize the italics in the meeting agenda are intended for emphasis only.,21,3,2,26,528
Congratulations to all for this landslide victory.,21,3,2,26,528
This board carries too much weight.,20,5,1,26,528
Why do you always have to be so obtuse?,20,5,1,26,528
"Before we begin, would someone please straighten the whiteboard? It's hanging crooked.",20,5,1,26,528
I favor the motion.,21,3,2,26,528
I see that a different perspective doesn't change anything.,21,3,2,26,528
The first item on our agenda is a proposal that we take the wheels off of our chairs.,20,5,1,26,528
So it's unamimous. The Titanic Directorship votes for Trump.,20,5,1,26,528
"People, the ship is sinking....",22,1,3,26,528
Your uncle Louis was not the great architect you thought he was.,20,5,1,26,528
We are here to debate whether fracking is or is not a problem. Is there a motion from the floor?,19,7,0,26,528
In this company you have to climb the table.,20,5,1,26,528
Let's be careful how we spin this.,21,3,2,26,528
"Again, any rumors suggesting a downward slide with the company's performance are unfounded.",21,3,2,26,528
Let's all just take a step back for a moment,20,5,1,26,528

"""We share this floor with ""Weight Watchers"".",20,5,1,26,528
"Dave, would you please straighten out the easel board?",20,5,1,26,528
I see you're leaning toward a consensus.,20,5,1,26,528
Let's not make this all about me,19,7,0,26,528
And no more nonsense about a lack of a level playing field !,20,5,1,26,528
"If I don't have an answer in 30 seconds, I let go of the table.",21,3,2,26,528
I thought we might gain some new perspectives this way.,21,3,2,26,528
I am tired of hearing people say the company's going downhill.,20,5,1,26,528
Well! Looks like I get to be chairman.,20,5,1,26,528
I do hope you all understand the gravity of the situation!,21,3,2,26,528
This meeting is going down hill fast.,21,3,2,26,528
Does anyone else want a Dramamine?,21,3,2,26,528
"Please understand, it is only through mere architectural idiosyncrasy that I'm talking down to you.",20,5,1,26,528
"As new employees, your first task is to pull up a chair.",21,3,2,26,528
I reject your slippery slope argument.,19,7,0,26,528
Which one of you had the idea to meet on a cruise ship?,21,3,2,26,528
I sense a definite shift in attitude around here,19,7,0,26,528
"I said..., this discussion appears a bit lopsided.",21,3,2,26,528
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that the rumors about the building's structural instability are completely false.",19,7,0,26,528
"Gentlemen, I'm not sure you understand the gravity of our situation.",20,5,1,26,528
I told you the last time we needed a different perspective.,20,5,1,26,528
The quick fix would be to remove the casters from each chair.,21,3,2,26,528
"The good news is, sales are flat.",21,3,2,26,528
If you want to get onto my management table you're gonna have to push yourselves real hard,20,5,1,26,528
"Okay, I'm gonna let go now. Watch me. Watch me, guys. It's gonna be awesome. Brad you aren't looking.",21,3,2,26,528
Being at the head of the table has it's advantages.,20,5,1,26,528
"We've got to get the company back on an even keel, guys.",19,7,0,26,528
Of course your argument has weight.,21,3,2,26,528
I hope you understand the gravity of this meeting.,20,5,1,26,528
What's say we let this motion slide?,19,7,0,26,528
I like the way you all look up to me.,21,3,2,26,528
There's been a seismic shift in our management.,19,7,0,26,528
"So, whose idea was this feng shui thing?",20,5,1,26,528
It's called 'disruptive architecture'.,19,7,0,26,528
Whoa.....I think your opinions weigh a lot more than mine!,20,5,1,26,528
"Except for the occasional earthquake, I think you will enjoy living here in California.",21,3,2,26,528
When I said we need to rollback I meant prices!,19,7,0,26,528
I understand your position. But that's just not the way I roll.,20,5,1,26,528
Today we will discuss the balance of power in our organization.,18,4,1,23,528
Who put this to a floor vote?,18,4,1,23,528
"As you may have noticed, our company is experiencing a downturn.",18,4,1,23,528
I didn't mean this arrangement to imply an imbalance of power.,18,4,1,23,528
Let's do a roll call vote instead.,19,2,2,23,528
So it's 7 to 1 in favor of chairs with no wheels.,18,4,1,23,528
Compensation is based on a sliding scale.,18,4,1,23,528
"All in favor of removing the wheels from the chairs, say “Aye!”",18,4,1,23,528
"Perhaps it comes as no surprise, the company is slipping.",19,2,2,23,528
I think your view is slanted. Look at it from my angle.,19,2,2,23,528
I was really hoping we could meet in the middle on this one.,17,6,0,23,528
"At first I thought the consensus was skewed, but now I'm inclined to join you.",19,4,1,24,528
I believe you all understand the gravity of our situation.,19,4,1,24,528
Dale got tired of others talking down him.,19,4,1,24,528
I sense a bias here.,18,6,0,24,528
I get the sense that many of you are leaning in the same direction on this.,18,6,0,24,528
"'Aye,' 1. ""Nay,"" seven. The ""Aye"" has it.",19,4,1,24,528
A little leverage here!,20,2,2,24,528
"Okay, then, all those in favor of moving our offices out of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, say 'Aye'.",19,4,1,24,528
Anybody got a mint?,19,4,1,24,528
Norris avoided mentioning the elephant under the room when conducting meetings.,20,2,2,24,528
Maybe the cruise ship offsite was a bad idea.,19,4,1,24,528
You'll find working here at 45 Degree Investments a real challenge.,18,6,0,24,528
My position gives me a unique perspective.,19,4,1,24,528
I want you all to level with me.,19,4,1,24,528
Could someone PLEASE call maintenance and get that painting straightened!!!,19,4,1,24,528
"Though novel, renting office space in Pisa was a mistake.",19,4,1,24,528
It's all downhill from here.,19,4,1,24,528
Rigged? What makes you think the system is rigged?,18,6,0,24,528
I believe you realize the gravity of the situation.,19,4,1,24,528
Welcome to our new Pisa branch.,20,2,2,24,528
"""Now the room's feng shui is perfect"".",12,4,0,16,528
Someone's rocking the boat!,20,2,2,24,528
"Even though I'm now part of management, I want us to continue to be a team.",19,4,1,24,528
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.,19,4,1,24,528
...And now I wish to speak to you about a matter of some gravity...,19,4,1,24,528
I think we know which way we're leaning. Let's vote on it.,18,6,0,24,528
I can officially confirm what you already know; we're going under.,19,4,1,24,528
"OK, maybe Pisa wasn't the best place to build our office.",20,2,2,24,528
I'm sensing some resistance to my proposal.,18,6,0,24,528
Does that picture look crooked to you?,19,4,1,24,528
Leaning in is so last year.,20,2,2,24,528
Of course management values your opinions.,21,0,3,24,528
You need to level with me so we can straighten this out.,20,2,2,24,528
Executive compensation will be based on your ability to remain at the table.,19,4,1,24,528
I don't have to tell you it's been a lean year for the foundation.,19,4,1,24,528
"First, I'd like to welcome you all to Pisa, Inc.",20,2,2,24,528
I sense that you all have shifted your position on this matter.,19,4,1,24,528
And over there is the Empire State Building. Say... does that look lopsided at all to any of you?,19,4,1,24,528
"Henceforth, we shall look to levelling the playing field.",19,4,1,24,528
First I want to thank each of you for weighing in on the new strategic plan.,21,0,3,24,528
Rumors that the company is going downhill are vastly exaggerated.,18,6,0,24,528
Tell me a time you went above and beyond.,19,4,1,24,528
I get it. I have bad breath.,20,2,2,24,528
OK. I can see which way your vote is leaning.,18,6,0,24,528
Simply place your hand on the table if you disagree.,20,2,2,24,528
The first one to compare this downturn to the Titanic is fired.,20,2,2,24,528

"I am sorry to say, corporate called and they're closing the Pisa office.",19,4,1,24,528
Ceci n'est pas une optical illusion,20,2,2,24,528
This is the easiest way I can explain trickle down economics to you.,19,4,1,24,528
"I repeat, rumours about this company being a 'sinking ship' are completely false.",20,2,2,24,528
"Okay, so how are we going to spin this? Ideas?",20,2,2,24,528
We better get paid more than the placebo group.,20,2,2,24,528
"OK, I'm gonna start by being level with you...",19,4,1,24,528
"Yes, if you think it is prudent, we can put deodorant on the agenda under new business.",20,2,2,24,528
Thank you for meeting in Pisa.,19,4,1,24,528
"Well, we knew Pisa wasn't to code when we moved in.",18,6,0,24,528
Impressed? Now let's take that vote again,20,2,2,24,528
"Ok, so `fair and balanced' is a bad slogan.",19,4,1,24,528
You guys are real downers!,18,6,0,24,528
"you do know that ""cooties"" don't really exist right?",19,4,1,24,528
"Perhaps you all were right, wheels were a bad idea.",19,4,1,24,528
"Due to events beyond our control, the round table discussion has been canceled.",19,4,1,24,528
Why do I get the feeling you're not all leveling with me?,20,2,2,24,528
"Obviously, you do not grasp the gravity of the situation.",18,6,0,24,528
Which one of you signed off on the architect?,18,6,0,24,528
The motion on the floor is to remove the rollers from the chairs.,20,2,2,24,528
Is anyone still not clear that we operate on a sliding scale?,19,4,1,24,528
Profits aren't the only thing that have taken a dip this quarter.,19,4,1,24,528
I think this puts our disagreement in perspective.,20,2,2,24,528
The company is pivoting in a new direction.,19,4,1,24,528
Angle? What angle? I don't have any angle.,19,4,1,24,528
I'm inclined to agree with you.,19,4,1,24,528
I move we adjourn at this point and reconvene outdoors on higher ground.,19,4,1,24,528
Firstly I want no talk of a sinking ship !,13,2,1,16,528
I am finally beginning to appreciate the gravity of the situation.,20,2,2,24,528
We're here to discuss a matter of the utmost gravity.,18,6,0,24,528

welcome back,20,2,2,24,528
"You may be wondering why our architecture and design firm is closing, effective immediately . . .",19,4,1,24,528
Shall I chair?,19,4,1,24,528
One more weighted opinion and I let go of the table.,20,2,2,24,528
"First, let's talk about the purpose of a focus group.",20,2,2,24,528
"It was a rough quarter, but we remain long-term focused here at Titanic Enterprises",20,2,2,24,528
Have I made my position clear enough?,20,2,2,24,528
It's a good thing that you're all sitting down....,20,2,2,24,528
HR thinks we might be a bit top heavy.,18,6,0,24,528
"We have a problem, and I know you'd all appreciate some straight talk.",20,2,2,24,528
I know it's the picture frame.,20,2,2,24,528
"Boy, that tilted window is driving me nuts!",19,4,1,24,528
"Let's face it, your performances are slipping.",19,4,1,24,528
I am unmoved by the gravity of consensus.,19,4,1,24,528
It takes bold leadership to admit that the wheeled chairs were a mistake.,20,2,2,24,528
I hope you don't box yourselves into a corner during these negotations.,20,2,2,24,528
Good news! The breaks for your chairs are on the truck!,20,2,2,24,528
You may have read about the shift in our corporate culture...,18,6,0,24,528
What makes you think I'm slanting the news?,19,4,1,24,528
Holding our board meeting at sea may have not been the best ideal.,19,4,1,24,528
I hope you realize the gravity of the situation.,20,2,2,24,528
"You recognize, it's only by mere geological accident that I'm talking down to you.",19,4,1,24,528
"Obviously, chairs with wheels don't work well with our architectural style.",19,4,1,24,528
I see you're all tilting one way on this matter.,19,4,1,24,528
Pay will be on a sliding scale from now on.,19,4,1,24,528
"Remember, the money saved buying swamp land paid your bonuses this year.",20,2,2,24,528
Considering the gravity of the situation . . .,20,2,2,24,528
Next on the agenda is how will the company's profitability be influenced by the tilt of the earth's axis.,20,2,2,24,528
"On the plus side, today’s meeting space came in under budget.",20,2,2,24,528
"OK, you all are Europe and I'm Britain.",18,6,0,24,528
"No, I'm pretty sure this is more than just a paradigm shift.",19,4,1,24,528
"I think, then, we can dispense with the graph.",19,4,1,24,528
I suggest that today's focus group is not fairly balanced.,18,6,0,24,528
NOW do you get the gravity of this situation?,19,4,1,24,528
Corporate has made it clear which way they are leaning...,19,4,1,24,528
Let's try to do our level best.,19,4,1,24,528
First up on today's agenda: whoever purchased rolly chairs is fired.,19,4,1,24,528
Why are we meeting on a boat?,20,2,2,24,528
I knew this Board was crooked.,19,4,1,24,528
None of you seem to be aware of the gravity of this situation.,19,4,1,24,528
I have a vague sense that I may not have the Board's full support on this one.,19,4,1,24,528
It's all a matter of perspective.,18,6,0,24,528
"The bad news is, an earthquake hit the building and we're all going to die. The good news is, from this angle, next year's marketing projections look great.",21,0,3,24,528

"Jones, have the wheels removed from conference room chairs until we dock. And straighten the bulletin board.",18,6,0,24,528
"Just wait till the floor drops, too!",20,2,2,24,528
First item of business - the new architectural review committee,18,6,0,24,528
Does that picture look crooked to you? It's driving me crazy.,20,2,2,24,528
"Allow me to rephrase, keep both hands on the table, if not in favor of tomorrow's meeting being held on board.",20,2,2,24,528
About the motion to replace the rolling chairs…,19,4,1,24,528
Which one of you tilted the painting?,18,6,0,24,528
Does anybody have any questions?,19,4,1,24,528
I want to hear whateveryone at this table has to say.,19,4,1,24,528
All in favor of manning the life boats?,19,4,1,24,528
So I perceive the entire room is in opposition!,19,4,1,24,528
Could somebody please straighten the picture on the wall again?,19,4,1,24,528
I think it's about time we got this ship on an even keel.,18,6,0,24,528
I can't emphasize enough the gravity of our situation.,20,2,2,24,528
Let the record show that it's 7 to 1 in favor of level floors.,18,6,0,24,528
"Martha, can you please lean in?",19,4,1,24,528
I'm not certain this is the right committee to balance the budget.,18,6,0,24,528
Harold is rocking the boat - again,19,4,1,24,528
Who wants a kiss?,20,2,2,24,528
Didn't I specifically say to order the chairs without wheels?,19,4,1,24,528
"Now, I understand there have been some wild rumors going around about a leveraged buyout.",18,6,0,24,528
I like talking down to you.,19,4,1,24,528
Our landlord contends we must have defective furniture and astigmatism.,19,4,1,24,528
There was just enough room in the budget to straighten the window.,19,4,1,24,528
You all say things are looking up; I have a different point of view!,19,4,1,24,528
We've got a new slant on team bonding.,19,4,1,24,528
Now you shall see the gravity of the situation that our company is in.,20,2,2,24,528
This is as level as the playing field is ever going to get.,19,4,1,24,528
It appears that negotiations have shifted in your favor,19,4,1,24,528
"Well, I can see you all appreciate the gravity of the situation.",19,4,1,24,528
I'm sure you understand the gravity of the situation.,20,2,2,24,528
Was it something I said?,19,4,1,24,528
So you all think we need to take a different slant?,18,6,0,24,528
"Self leveling picture frames , that's my pitch.",19,4,1,24,528
You're probably all wondering why I sceduled this meeting in Pisa.,20,2,2,24,528
I feel like your perspective on this may be slightly skewed.,18,6,0,24,528
"Perhaps one of you would like to propose an adjournment?""",21,2,2,25,528
"So, I take it you all appreciate the gravity of the situation...",20,4,1,25,528
Words cannot express the gravity of our current situation.,20,4,1,25,528
Welcome to the monthly meeting of the Pisa Chamber of Commerce.,19,6,0,25,528
Let me try to straighten this whole thing out.,20,4,1,25,528
Which one of you demanded a level playing field?,21,2,2,25,528
So the balance of power shifts.,20,4,1,25,528
Welcome to our corporate offices in Pisa.,20,4,1,25,528
The board thinks we'll benefit from a new perspective.,20,4,1,25,528
I called this stockholders meeting to dispel any rumors you have heard that we are not on the level.,20,4,1,25,528
"Good evening, economy class employees",22,0,3,25,528
Things may be looking up from where you are; but from here it's all downhill.,20,4,1,25,528
Looks like the balance of power has titled a bit.,21,2,2,25,528
Let's look at this from another angle,20,4,1,25,528
You're in no position to negotiate,20,4,1,25,528
Things are looking up.,20,4,1,25,528
"Well, we all knew a ""leave"" win in the U.K. was going to cause problems for everyone.",20,4,1,25,528
"Not only are you way out of order, but you also do not seem to appreciate the gravity of our situation.",21,2,2,25,528

So it's agreed. We won't have our meetings on a giant see-saw anymore.,21,2,2,25,528
"I'm still here for you, aren't I?",21,2,2,25,528
I want all of you to level with me!,21,2,2,25,528
Now onto our third corporate value: A Level Playing Field.,20,4,1,25,528
We just need to change our perspective.,20,4,1,25,528

"No, the table is in motion!",20,4,1,25,528
"Surprisingly, sales of the garlic-flavored breath mints fell below expectations.",21,2,2,25,528
Stop rocking the boat.,20,4,1,25,528
We're meeting here today to address concerns about this company's perspective.,21,2,2,25,528
"I prefer we use the term ""correction.""",19,6,0,25,528
At least it's not a full downturn.,20,4,1,25,528
Who else feels my anger has gotten out of control?,20,4,1,25,528
Can't anyone hang the art straight?,20,4,1,25,528
Perhaps we can level the playing field a bit.,19,6,0,25,528
This shift in policy will feel like a slippery slope for some of you.,20,4,1,25,528
It probably seems like this discussion about your raises is tilted in my favor.,19,6,0,25,528
Pay no attention to the painting on the wall.,20,4,1,25,528
Does removing the casters deal with the symptom and not address the problem?,22,0,3,25,528
And everyone said Pisa was a bad place to relocate the company.,20,4,1,25,528
"Just so you know, naughty corners have been shown to improve efficiency by a full percentile.",21,2,2,25,528
Fine. I'LL straighten the picture frame.,21,2,2,25,528
I firmly believe in the balance of power.,20,4,1,25,528
Sorry...beans for lunch.,20,4,1,25,528
The whole damn scheme is collapsing.,21,2,2,25,528
I reject the notion that the Brexit result has been seismic.,20,4,1,25,528
I thought we'd try a new angle,20,4,1,25,528
"Note to Earthquake Committee: ""Take rollers off Boardroom chairs.""",21,2,2,25,528
I'd like to propose that we purchase chairs without casters.,20,4,1,25,528
We need a new angle.,21,2,2,25,528
Production is down. Sales are down. Profits are down...,20,4,1,25,528
Anyone still thinking I was kidding when I said your backs are against the wall?,20,4,1,25,528
I want to put a new slant on things.,20,4,1,25,528
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with this picture?,21,2,2,25,528
"Yes, just a brief meeting . . .you go first, Sisyphus.",20,4,1,25,528
"Yes, it is a slippery slope and you are all fired.",20,4,1,25,528
Welcome to our first board meeting at the tallest skyscraper in the world.,21,2,2,25,528
"To commence our new Fit for Work, Fit for Life regimen, we're asking you all to scoot your chairs up to the table ten times.",20,4,1,25,528
This was the most affordable space.Now lets discuss the rolling chairs.,20,4,1,25,528
My position has shifted.,20,4,1,25,528
Thus concludes the July meeting of the Pisa Co-Op Association.,21,2,2,25,528
"So, it's fair to say you're leaning toward restructuring.",20,4,1,25,528
"Sadly, our productivity has waned since we did away with the bean bag chairs.",20,4,1,25,528
Thank you all for weathering this current downturn.,20,4,1,25,528
Can someone please straighten the screen?,20,4,1,25,528
The last architect we hired was let go for obvious reasons.,19,6,0,25,528
I'm told it was an iceberg on Lexington.,19,6,0,25,528
"Now that we've tabled the motion, let's move on.",20,4,1,25,528
"All in favor of purchasing caster cups, say 'aye'.",21,2,2,25,528
Leveling the playing field will not be as easy as you might think.,21,2,2,25,528
And I don't want any cliches.,20,4,1,25,528
I'll repeat. I need one volunteer to relocate to our location in Trenton.,20,4,1,25,528
It's obvious which way the room is leaning,21,2,2,25,528
I see you have all weighed in with your opinions,19,6,0,25,528
"Ok, I'll stop buying my cologne from the dollar store.",21,2,2,25,528
It's lonely at the top.,20,4,1,25,528
You're slant is totally wrong. Look at the big picture.,20,4,1,25,528
The annual meeting of the M.C. Escher Society will now come to order.,20,4,1,25,528
"Then it's agreed. The next construction job that comes in, someone in the drafting room starts with a level.",20,4,1,25,528
"On second thought, maybe we shouldn't have opened a branch office in Pisa.",22,0,3,25,528
We want your free unbiased opinion on this issue.,21,2,2,25,528
"Welcome to Advanced Business Jargon Training. Repeat after me: it is a slippery slope to not give everyone a seat at the table, you're leaning against the idea, but your backs are against the wall.",20,4,1,25,528
This isn't what I meant when I said we should move some of our staff around,19,6,0,25,528
I knew you were all leaning that way from the moment I sat down.,20,4,1,25,528
"Once again, any opposed?",20,4,1,25,528
It looks like you already know why I've called you all here.,20,4,1,25,528
"Come to think of it, I guess it is a slanted argument.",20,4,1,25,528
Maybe relocating to Pisa wasn't such a good idea.,20,4,1,25,528
We're on a very slippery slope here.,22,0,3,25,528
"I agree, I think some leverage is needed here.",21,2,2,25,528
First time in the Pisa conference room?,19,6,0,25,528
"As I said, everyone slides right into their role",21,2,2,25,528
You need to have strong hands to keep your seat at this table.,21,2,2,25,528
How do you all like my power office?,20,4,1,25,528
Brilliant! We'll put brakes on the chairs.,19,6,0,25,528
"As you can see, we are currently experiencing a down side in the cruise line industry.",20,4,1,25,528
I'll be honest - things are not looking up.,20,4,1,25,528
I usually hate all things European but this Dutch architecture is growing on me.,21,2,2,25,528
On the upside!,19,6,0,25,528
"I don't disagree that scheduling this meeting on a ship was, in hindsight, a bad idea.",19,6,0,25,528
I hope you all realize the gravity of this situation.,21,2,2,25,528
I feel your support slip sliding away.,19,6,0,25,528
This was cheaper than getting all of you shorter chairs.,21,2,2,25,528
Everything you do in this company will be an uphill struggle.,20,4,1,25,528
I'm inclined to agree with you. You've put a whole new slant on it.,20,4,1,25,528
These cruise ship staff meetings would go a lot smoother if Jeff hadn't ordered us rolling chairs.,19,6,0,25,528
......but on the upside,20,4,1,25,528
You might think I have a slanted view on this issue.,20,4,1,25,528
"Mr. Dibbles, that's NOT the best way to make the sales chart trend upward.",20,4,1,25,528
"No, we don't lead through consensus at Teeter-Totter, Inc.",19,6,0,25,528
We need to start looking at this from a new angle.,19,6,0,25,528
I see no problem with wheeled chairs... motion denied.,19,6,0,25,528
Open Wide.,21,2,2,25,528
Not what I meant by 'Let's have a big rollout'.,19,6,0,25,528
We may have overshifted our paradigm,19,6,0,25,528
"Obviously, you were invited to this focus group because you all lean to the right.",20,4,1,25,528
I would like to level with you.,20,4,1,25,528
You may have noticed recently a shift in the balance of power.,20,4,1,25,528
I'm glad you all realize the gravity of the situation.,20,4,1,25,528
Who ever promised you an even playfield??,20,4,1,25,528
You people are going to be surprised by the new slant I have on the issue.,20,4,1,25,528
We have to strike a balance.,21,2,2,25,528
Backsliders! All of you.,20,4,1,25,528
"Now that I have your attention. "" Welcome to Engineering and Design!",20,4,1,25,528
I told you it was a slippery slope.,19,6,0,25,528
"Welcome to our annual Descendants of the Titanic meeting, or is it still too soon?",19,6,0,25,528
I think we need to take a different slant on this.,20,4,1,25,528
Please roll your chair back to the table so we can continue this Sisyphus Corp. Board meeting.,20,4,1,25,528
You're still inside the box.,20,4,1,25,528
I think it's time we start talking about delisting.,19,6,0,25,528
I'm confident we can ride out this slight downturn...,19,6,0,25,528
No matter what. We are fair and balanced.,20,4,1,25,528
"Thank you for attending the final meeting of the Titanic Safety Committee. George, explain your suggestion about installing life preservers in meeting rooms.",21,2,2,25,528
Welcome to our annual Descendants of the Titanic meeting.,20,4,1,25,528
"I realize that things have been stressful around the office lately, but I assure you that we're now on the downward slope.",20,4,1,25,528
The Donald has deemed us crooked.,21,2,2,25,528
The latest figures suggest we're on the decline.,19,6,0,25,528
This is a paradigm shift.,20,4,1,25,528
It's time we take this company in a new direction.,20,4,1,25,528
I want to get your slant on this.,20,4,1,25,528
Next on the agenda: Infastructure,20,4,1,25,528
i'm here to confirm that it indeed flows downhill,21,2,2,25,528
"Wow, I really taught you guys were on my side",21,2,2,25,528
"...""the good news is, we're moving our headquarters back to Florence.""",20,4,1,25,528
One of you is going out that window until we figure this out,21,2,2,25,528
"Clearly, our perspectives are different!",21,2,2,25,528
Of COURSE you can have a seat at the table - just not at MY table.,21,2,2,25,528
Let's look at it from a different angle.,20,4,1,25,528
But building without a foundation saved us a lot of money.,19,6,0,25,528
My position is clear....,20,4,1,25,528
"Yes, I have the zika virus--nevertheless, I'm qualified for the job.",21,2,2,25,528
"Come on guys, my wife always makes me tuna for lunch.",20,4,1,25,528
So you think my argument is slanted one way?,20,4,1,25,528
"You, there, on my right, what's so damned funny?",21,2,2,25,528
"Well, I'm disappointed--I was hoping you'd level with me.",20,4,1,25,528
What do you mean I'm not being level with you?,19,6,0,25,528
This meeting of the Cruise Line Shipping Association is now called to order.,20,4,1,25,528
This is what I mean by top-down decision making,20,4,1,25,528
You don't like the angle I'm coming from?,20,4,1,25,528
Maybe we shouldn't have chosen Pisa for our corporate offices.,20,4,1,25,528
