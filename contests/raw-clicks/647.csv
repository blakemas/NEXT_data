"You had to go and call him abominable, didn’t you?",206,56,25,287,647,631
"If I have to settle for cold and emotionless, I’ll go with the Yeti.",200,55,24,279,647,299
"He's a great guide, but he's not much for conversation.",193,69,17,279,647,3343
This isn't what I meant when I asked for a local guide.,215,56,27,298,647,5696
"That whole ""abominable"" thing is no longer PC.  Can we just go with ""Alpine Hominid""?",193,56,22,271,647,280
"When you said we'd have a local guide, I didn't understand just how local you meant.",209,55,26,290,647,5086
I said he was evolving. Not that he and I were involved.,211,51,28,290,647,6061
Not Yeti was a perfectly appropriate pun.,214,50,29,293,647,3066
He wanted directions to “Sasquatchewan”,220,56,28,304,647,1637
I can't explain it.  It just happened.,208,49,28,285,647,2545
"Again, his name is Edwin and he identifies as POST-human.",210,76,18,304,647,3349
Wow. I always assumed that Bigfoot was a male.,206,53,26,285,647,4578
"Next time, you get the guide!",196,60,21,277,647,3407
He seemed nice but he didn't know anyone who went to Yale.,197,58,22,277,647,3955
"'...honest, it's nothing...we're just friends.'",218,65,24,307,647,5764
He'll be right back; he forgot to feed the cat.,189,61,19,269,647,645
He says we’re too loud.,193,53,23,269,647,5978
What did you say to him?,183,60,18,261,647,3095
He'll be right back.  He forgot his phone.,191,62,19,272,647,753
Abominable? No. I think he just lacks People skills. Let's press on.,192,60,20,272,647,5027
"No, Jason...the $250 you spent on that trekking pole...that's abominable.",220,53,29,302,647,477
"He prefers ""they"" and thought ""abominable"" was very judgmental",201,60,22,283,647,3261
He was mainly complaining about his abominable wife.,190,51,23,264,647,2668
"Oh God, do you think he saw us?",193,63,19,275,647,377
He wondered why women always have to be the one asking for directions.,198,53,24,275,647,3986
"Okay, you're right. Everybody goes to Davos now.",193,63,19,275,647,5719
He's a local,182,54,20,256,647,774
You really insulted him. Any idiot knows the difference between Sasquatch and The Abominable Snowman.,177,64,15,256,647,3249
If you think his FEET are big ...,201,65,20,286,647,846
See what?,188,60,19,267,647,1320
He said we shouldn't have spent so much money on Gore-Tex,195,46,26,267,647,1745
"I asked if we were near the summit, and he said, ‘Not yeti.’",195,46,26,267,647,5621
Flip a coin to see whose tent he shares?,208,69,20,297,647,265
"'Let's unplug,' he says. 'Who needs phones on hikes?' he says. Bigfoot dammit! People who see Bigfoot need phones on hikes!",197,60,21,278,647,3260
Yes he is abominable and you voted for him...,208,38,32,278,647,4247
"YOU never tell me how good I look without make-up,",202,68,19,289,647,4744
He said he's going to Starbucks and asked if we wanted anything.,194,53,23,270,647,476
He seemed nice.,221,66,24,311,647,2934
You were supposed to bring the camera!,201,57,23,281,647,1454
He said 'No one's going to believe me when I tell them I saw you.',199,61,21,281,647,3559
He said conditions up ahead are abominable.,205,49,27,281,647,3761
Everything was fine till you made that manscaping crack.,188,52,22,262,647,3743
Are you sure this was the guide we booked on Travelocity?,191,46,25,262,647,5383
"He said, ""Don't tell anyone you saw me.""",216,63,24,303,647,1699
We met in college. He's just a friend.,212,71,20,303,647,5043
Did you think he was abominable? I thought he was sort of nice.,190,66,17,273,647,2647
He asked if we'd seen any abominable snow women in the vicinity.,195,56,22,273,647,5021
Of course I'm leaving you. Look at those feet.,202,60,22,284,647,3527
He's gone to tell all the other Bigfoots that we really do exist.,199,66,19,284,647,4159
I can’t believe you’re leaving me for him. You made me shave everything!,213,56,26,295,647,2621
He wanted to know if America was great again.,210,62,23,295,647,4841
All I said was that we think he’s a myth.,213,56,26,295,647,4899
I told you he was the best guide if you want to avoid the crowds.,188,57,20,265,647,3470
"He may be abominable, but you're just a jerk.",203,45,28,276,647,36
‘Abominable’? Really? Go apologize.,199,53,24,276,647,974
"Well let's just follow that guy then, he seems to know where he's going.",200,69,18,287,647,2935
It said we're just a figment of its imagination.,215,57,26,298,647,118
"OK, so it's Big Foot not a yeti. You really know how to spoil a moment don't you.",187,46,24,257,647,3427
"'Hire a sherpa,' I said. 'Let's go a little native,' you said.",214,64,23,301,647,6021
He was just wondering if my boots come in a 26-E.,183,59,18,260,647,5195
He just wanted to make sure that we knew that this is a clothing optional mountain.,196,69,17,282,647,3591
I was told it’s a great hike but with all this cloud cover there’s  just not anything that interesting to see.,202,57,23,282,647,3593
He said I could do better if I didn’t shave my legs.,204,58,23,285,647,1737
This is humiliating for us. I bet he never even trained.,202,62,21,285,647,3522
He has to go back up. He thinks he left his iPhone at the summit.,210,64,22,296,647,5809
I'm starting to think he's not a sherpa.,189,57,20,266,647,538
He's not the guy. He says his name is 'Yeto'.,188,59,19,266,647,4995
We look like tourists.,198,57,22,277,647,385
"Can we leave our phones behind and connect with nature for once?""
Good call Marty",205,61,22,288,647,3234
"What can I say, I have primitive taste.",198,44,27,269,647,11
"Bigfoot is a no good, hairy vagrant who contributes nothing to -- he's right behind me, isn't he?",191,58,20,269,647,5889
"Oh yeah? Well, you wouldn't notice if a Yeti walked by!",197,64,19,280,647,4443
Well that was a little anti-climatic. We still don't know the meaning of life.,208,60,23,291,647,2294
He’s your uncle; you tell him to put some clothes on.,191,45,25,261,647,1368
"He mumbled something about ""the wall""  and kept going",187,53,21,261,647,3582
We need to go back to the crevasse and take a left.,186,55,20,261,647,5403
I told him I was looking for a more evolved guy.,204,55,24,283,647,4403
"Sorry Dave, but you know what they say--big foot...""",210,43,30,283,647,5484
Just for once can I ask for directions?,212,57,25,294,647,2880
"It’s not you, it’s him.",205,58,23,286,647,437
Great. Now we've lost our guide.,208,52,26,286,647,1749
"You know, he was actually kinda bominable.",199,52,24,275,647,2686
I didn't see HIM using a GPS,193,64,18,275,647,3290
"That was really insensitive, John.",233,61,28,322,647,3976
He is going ahead to see if we can get a table by the window.,203,49,26,278,647,4698
"He's just going to get his camera so he can take a selfie with us.""",217,62,24,303,647,1287
"Calling him abominable Jeffrey, doesn’t change the fact that he’s still  president",228,40,35,303,647,5286
I told you not to mention his small hands!,204,52,25,281,647,1646
That nice hairy man said he would like to have us over for dinner tonight.,198,46,26,270,647,1576
"I’m sorry Brett. It’s been an amazing journey, but I just have to follow my heart.",185,54,20,259,647,1059
You're imagining things.  I'm not seeing anyone else.,203,59,22,284,647,3388
I can in fact confirm that we are standing downwind.,181,67,14,262,647,3180
"I'm sorry, John.  I have to follow my heart.",185,59,18,262,647,4179
"Yes, the Ice Man has cometh.",181,49,21,251,647,3023
Is it possible that we are in a car insurance commercial?,179,53,19,251,647,4505
Don't wait up.,210,68,20,298,647,5154
He called me an abominable human being!,211,48,28,287,647,2345
He said he thought we were unsubstantiated sightings,201,50,25,276,647,1044
He said we could post a photo as long as we don’t tag him.,196,60,20,276,647,2283
"You know, it’d be a lot easier to find Bigfoot if we weren’t blind.",180,38,25,243,647,249
He was hoping we could give him directions.,203,69,18,290,647,215
Here's my idea: you follow him while I leave.,207,43,29,279,647,1200
"I’m going with him, he doesn’t need to stop all the time to ask for directions!",185,51,21,257,647,5851
Of course he’s upset. ‘Sasquatch’ is a slur! The proper term is ‘Hirsute-American.’,180,43,23,246,647,397
I told him that we already had plans for dinner.,200,62,20,282,647,1036
That reminds me. You need to go in for another back waxing.,208,46,28,282,647,3006
"Sorry, Jorge, but size does matter. A lot.",208,46,28,282,647,3719
He said to count to ten and try to find him again.,219,65,23,307,647,4042
"Yeah, I'm freezing, too! We should have sprung for the PolarFleece Xtreme suit like Gary did.",173,44,21,238,647,4564
He could have asked for directions. Yeti didn't.,199,51,24,274,647,115
He said our footprint is bigger than his is now.,196,57,21,274,647,3659
Can you believe it? He acted like he doesn’t even know us.,213,64,22,299,647,5233
"He just said ""Yeti, set go!"" and took off.",184,45,23,252,647,2295

"For the eighth time, it’s abominable, not abdominal.",222,51,29,302,647,1428
I haven'seen him since college.,188,60,18,266,647,3572
What do you mean you forgot the camera Brad!,207,63,21,291,647,1752
"He said he wants a guaranteed $655 per day, $2,272 per week, 3.6% of distributor's gross receipts for television/cable, and, for video discs, 4.5% of the first million sold and 5.4% thereafter. Call his agent tomorrow when you are ready to sign.",209,59,23,291,647,2658
"OK, have it your way. You saw a yeti.",208,61,22,291,647,3602
He says we're trespassing.,201,57,22,280,647,3165
I  wouldn't bother going all the way up. He says its lonely at the top.,172,56,16,244,647,1650
He's a little touchy about the A-word.,190,61,18,269,647,663
At least he listens to me.,199,43,27,269,647,3731
"The heart wants what it wants.
Good bye, Grayson.",202,60,21,283,647,1530
"I'm sorry Ted, I'm leaving you for a real whatever he is.",199,66,18,283,647,2195
More like the apathetic snowman to me,204,56,23,283,647,4125
"See, even Sasquatch will stop and ask for directions!",198,50,24,272,647,54
She got offended when I called her the Abominable Snow-MAN,192,62,18,272,647,2747
He's not exactly abominable...more like an antisocial climber.,207,55,24,286,647,5477
"We talked, and yeti, yeti, yeti, we're engaged.",175,60,15,250,647,341
Got anymore mushrooms?,201,49,25,275,647,1939

"Oh really, Carl? What's more likely, that Bigfoot's standing behind me, or that I'm very high and we're standing in a Wendy's?",209,56,24,289,647,3022
"That's just great, Tom! You can find an imaginary snow beast but you still can't find the courage to get me a ring.",191,51,22,264,647,3305
He said we're overdressed.,185,45,23,253,647,2167
He's twice the man you'll ever be.,209,61,22,292,647,649

"He knows a great ramen place.  And there's no wait.""",188,62,17,267,647,5592
I told you. He's sick of hearing about Trump.,203,55,23,281,647,1279
So many doubt his existence--he just needed to feel validated.,203,60,21,284,647,5756
"Due to climate change, we're seeing a lot more yettis this time of the year.",183,59,17,259,647,3757
"He’s really not much for conversation but for 50 bucks, he’ll let you take a selfie with him at the summit.",206,77,15,298,647,3962

"I 'm sorry Hans, he's just more equipped.",202,44,27,273,647,5082
No internet connection! There is no point to any of this if we can't post it to social media!,181,45,22,248,647,2405
I.m leaving because at least HE isn't going to spend years figuring out if he wants to go back to graduate school or finally start a family.,214,66,21,301,647,3930
He might be abominable but at least he's willing to take our relationship to the next level.,215,64,22,301,647,6067
next time...I pick the guide!,186,58,18,262,647,1492
He says unless he gets the wall he's not coming down.,193,44,25,262,647,3065
Melania finally did divorce him,203,47,26,276,647,2261
"I can't help myself, Stan. There's just something about Hairy.",195,63,18,276,647,5447

You could've asked for directions.,201,56,22,279,647,400
"Really? This mountain, this light and you want a picture of HIM?",198,62,19,279,647,3842
Ask him what the Wi-Fi password is.,213,55,25,293,647,5539
"No more arguing, I'm asking directions",219,66,22,307,647,3874
Well I’d walk away too if you kept calling me abominable.,204,55,23,282,647,1224

And Yet . . . I no longer find him abominable.,206,66,19,291,647,2783
It's pretty hairy going up.  Coming down not so much.,201,58,21,280,647,1361
"Look, he's local & says he knows a good coffee place. I thought we agreed to 'not be tourists' on this trip...",201,58,21,280,647,4006
He's pretty upset. He said he spotted me but no one believed him.,169,58,14,241,647,3723
He said he can't wait to tell his friends he met a real compassionate conservative in the wild.,211,48,27,286,647,3699
"What? All I meant was, proportionally, his feet aren't that large.",196,55,21,272,647,3091

"No, not a word. Just the cold shoulder.",199,54,22,275,647,6034
For the last time - don't call him that. He is very sensitive about his foot size,193,43,25,261,647,1204
Of course he’s upset! How would you feel if I went around calling you ‘big nose’?,190,49,22,261,647,3885
He insists he’s not.,183,63,15,261,647,4014
"He said we should close our eyes, count to 100, then try to find him.",189,51,21,261,647,5547
...But you had to have a no phone rule!,208,64,20,292,647,2382
"'Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints,' was NOT what I was expecting.",201,55,22,278,647,3984
"Thanks, Brad, I'll take it from here.",189,56,19,264,647,4043

He’s actually quite amiable.,212,64,18,294,647,5618
"Great, Todd.  Now even the Yeti is leaving!",217,54,23,294,647,5869
Big deal! I’d be much more excited by the existence of a snack bar right now.,176,58,13,247,647,5916
"He's moving to higher ground, citing habitat destruction and climate change.",216,61,20,297,647,4941
I think I know why our guide was so cheap.,213,67,17,297,647,5774

I recognized the face but couldn’t remember his name.,194,72,11,277,647,671

"I told him “no thanks, I have Google Maps.”",203,59,18,280,647,3847
I don't think he's going to be happy when he gets to the top and sees that we pooped in his cave.,203,59,18,280,647,4306
Apparently we misgendered the Abominable Snow Man,207,56,20,283,647,2638

It’s just “Snowman”. How would you like it if I always referred to you as Abominable Ralph?,207,58,19,284,647,108
He's a lot less expensive than a Sherpa.,204,64,16,284,647,1973
I told you-they don’t like to be called ‘abominable’ anymore.,210,57,20,287,647,879
He said to get off his yard.,213,71,15,299,647,737

He asked me if I had any conditioner.,202,50,21,273,647,4025
I would say that greeting a Yeti as Bigfoot qualifies us as ugly Americans.,208,43,25,276,647,103
Yeti or not there he goes.,203,53,20,276,647,3140

Make sure there's nothing in the background when you take the picture.,200,64,15,279,647,4095
The government shutdown is awful for sure ... but this volunteer tour guide is fantastic.,211,47,24,282,647,4080
He made a pass at me and you just stood there.,213,53,22,288,647,55

There's always somebody who shows off with no proper equipment or clothes.,201,54,19,274,647,1196
Asking him to 'play through' was a great idea.,203,55,19,277,647,4911
so apparently it's just a myth about foot size for men,207,47,23,277,647,5030
I thought he'd be taller.,207,57,19,283,647,577
"And WHY, exactly, didn't you ask him for directions...?",210,51,22,283,647,4707

Why don't men ask for directions when they're lost?,207,64,16,287,647,5117
He won't talk to anyone but CNN.,205,68,14,287,647,5659
"Jeez, sometimes it's like I'm invisible or something.",209,60,18,287,647,5823

Was that necessary? Did you have to call him abominable?,198,59,16,273,647,3491
Evolution? We can’t even keep up with him.,205,45,23,273,647,3744
Apparently abominable is a trigger word.,230,60,22,312,647,4192
More like adorable snowman.,190,65,12,267,647,5120
You clearly offended him by calling him Bigfoot. I believe ‘Yeti’ is the appropriate term.,207,66,15,288,647,5261
"He'll guide us, but he only takes Bitcoin.",200,55,18,273,647,5410
"Our guide is kind of built for this, don't you think?",211,68,15,294,647,5491
Apparently they run the upper section as a nudist colony.,195,55,17,267,647,5623
I thought your New Year's resolution was to start making new friends.,227,68,18,313,647,2875

"No, Ted-- you're fine. This is about me.",204,54,19,277,647,162
He just ate our sherpa.,204,49,21,274,647,3552
He invited me up for a drink.,200,52,19,271,647,3979

Much friendlier than the French!,209,56,19,284,647,5076
Who would have known that he's in the Witness Protection Program?,207,55,19,281,647,3490
