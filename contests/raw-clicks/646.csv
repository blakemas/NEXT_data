"He said that the tea room is closed for the season and the gift shop is sub-par, so I say we try K2.",183,59,20,262,646,2812

"It’s over, John. I’m going to follow my heart.",203,55,25,283,646,4229
he asked me to join the mile high club.  I told him that was an urban legend.,172,47,21,240,646,2209
I didn't see HIM using a GPS,186,63,18,267,646,3290
"He may be abominable, but at least he listens to me!",183,56,20,259,646,399
You are not paying attention to me.,206,54,26,286,646,886

I'm starting to think he's not a sherpa.,181,57,19,257,646,538
"Like I said, it gets a little hairy near the top.",177,65,15,257,646,3232
"He's just going to get his camera so he can take a selfie with us.""",210,61,24,295,646,1287
He seemed nice.,209,63,23,295,646,2934

He said he was going back up until Trump gets impeached.,198,41,29,268,646,2899

I was told it’s a great hike but with all this cloud cover there’s  just not anything that interesting to see.,192,55,22,269,646,3593
He said that  “closing the parks was an abomination”.,193,40,28,261,646,5981
I still think we should have asked for directions,174,47,21,242,646,872
Really? You had to use the 'a' word?,175,45,22,242,646,3183

Got anymore mushrooms?,195,48,25,268,646,1939
He was hoping we could give him directions.,195,66,18,279,646,215
"Oh really, Carl? What's more likely, that Bigfoot's standing behind me, or that I'm very high and we're standing in a Wendy's?",201,54,24,279,646,3022
It said we're just a figment of its imagination.,210,54,26,290,646,118
Great...now we have to have lunch with him!,176,55,18,249,646,2243

He wondered why women always have to be the one asking for directions.,189,48,23,260,646,3986
For the last time - don't call him that. He is very sensitive about his foot size,184,40,25,249,646,1204
I can in fact confirm that we are standing downwind.,172,64,13,249,646,3180

I said he was evolving. Not that he and I were involved.,205,49,26,280,646,6061
"He said dinner is at 7:00, and 'all paleo' is just a stereotype.",198,45,26,269,646,127
I told you. He's sick of hearing about Trump.,193,55,21,269,646,1279
"Look, he's local & says he knows a good coffee place. I thought we agreed to 'not be tourists' on this trip...",193,55,21,269,646,4006
They won't believe us if we don't have a selfie.,191,59,19,269,646,5220

"You heard him, Jim. We're just going to stop at his cave for a quick lunch and then we'll be on our way.",189,60,18,267,646,3032
He was just wondering if my boots come in a 26-E.,172,53,17,242,646,5195
He said that Donald Trump is a con man and its obvious that he had conspired with Russia to rig the 2016 election. He's optimistic because he can see how sharp and tough Nancy Pelosi is and he hopes to see the entire Trump family put in jail.,192,36,28,256,646,2809
I haven'seen him since college.,181,58,17,256,646,3572
"If I have to settle for cold and emotionless, I’ll go with the Yeti.",196,51,23,270,646,299
"Yes, Galen, I'm going with him. His empathetic listening skills and his willingness to forsake the negative din of social media are powerfully compelling inducements to cave dwelling.",193,57,20,270,646,2181
He's grouchy ; but he  runs an outstanding bed and breakfast.,186,53,20,259,646,4422

"Apparently, mistaking Yeti for Sasquatch is a no-no.",199,65,18,282,646,2174
I can’t believe you’re leaving me for him. You made me shave everything!,204,55,23,282,646,2621

Great. Now we've lost our guide.,203,49,25,277,646,1749
Go ahead.  You always wanted a man cave.,203,49,25,277,646,1754
...But you had to have a no phone rule!,197,61,19,277,646,2382
Oh my God! It's not a myth! It's true what they say about big feet!,202,51,24,277,646,4034

This is the LAST time you pick the guide!,191,55,20,266,646,5529
He called US the abominable ones.,210,45,28,283,646,1936
"We see celebrities all the time in New York, what's the big deal here?",205,55,23,283,646,2518
"He said he wants a guaranteed $655 per day, $2,272 per week, 3.6% of distributor's gross receipts for television/cable, and, for video discs, 4.5% of the first million sold and 5.4% thereafter. Call his agent tomorrow when you are ready to sign.",204,57,22,283,646,2658
It's pretty hairy going up.  Coming down not so much.,192,58,19,269,646,1361
Did you really have to ask him for a selfie?,194,54,21,269,646,2034
"Yeti, she persisted...",213,44,29,286,646,4171
He might be abominable but at least he's willing to take our relationship to the next level.,205,60,21,286,646,6067
At least he listens to me.,191,42,25,258,646,3731
He's not making foot prints because he's an illusion. What's our excuse?,200,52,23,275,646,2536
He looks like someone we could ask for directions,185,59,17,261,646,4853
"I found him quite pleasant, not abominable at all.",183,40,24,247,646,3162

He didn’t like my calling him Herr Suit.,214,52,26,292,646,3775
I.m leaving because at least HE isn't going to spend years figuring out if he wants to go back to graduate school or finally start a family.,209,62,21,292,646,3930
"I'll tell you what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to go back down this damn hill and tell everyone I saw...""BIGFOOT""!",200,57,21,278,646,1387
What do you mean you forgot the camera Brad!,198,61,19,278,646,1752

"I'm sorry, Peter, but I must leave you because I've come to realize that size does matter.",217,51,27,295,646,2416
"When you texted, ""Yeti digress,"" was there supposed to be a comma?",209,44,28,281,646,1537
He could have asked for directions. Yeti didn't.,195,49,23,267,646,115
What do you have against asking for directions?,193,53,21,267,646,1691
He says that they're building a wall but we'll have to pay for it.,195,49,23,267,646,6028
Are you sure it's not him? Let me see that photo again.,204,59,21,284,646,2836

He made a pass at me and you just stood there.,205,51,22,278,646,55

I told you we were overdressed.,187,69,11,267,646,2082
The Brooklyn beard craze is spreading.,197,54,19,270,646,3640
Asking him to 'play through' was a great idea.,197,54,19,270,646,4911

"Babe, trust me, it looks like he’s been here before.",199,57,18,274,646,634
"And WHY, exactly, didn't you ask him for directions...?",202,51,21,274,646,4707
Notice how he leaves no trace?,203,54,20,277,646,4141
"I've got to go with him.  He's the most understanding...whatever he is ... I've ever met.  I've treated him abominably, Yeti still loves me.",204,52,21,277,646,6009
Well that's a letdown. For some reason I thought his feet would be bigger.,202,61,17,280,646,4838
He seemed quite pleasant. Not at all abominable.,208,59,19,286,646,3093
He's incredibly sensitive. How could you?,216,48,25,289,646,4145
He's as lost as we are.,177,43,19,239,646,224
There's something off about our Sherpa.,175,57,13,245,646,5905

"I said, ""Ready to meet the world?"" And he said, ""Not yeti.""",196,55,18,269,646,2540
Turns out his name is Melvin.,194,64,14,272,646,5742
The track gets a bit hairy from this point,203,56,19,278,646,4773
I told you we should have asked for directions sooner.,204,59,18,281,646,1440
You're the one that claims to be so evolved,206,60,18,284,646,5582

"It's not you, it's me. Well, it's me and Bigfoot.",179,56,14,249,646,5404
Do you think he'll divulge our existence?,178,58,13,249,646,5900

I told you-they don’t like to be called ‘abominable’ anymore.,201,52,20,273,646,879
He will send us the selfie once he gets better reception.,208,38,27,273,646,1635
He won't talk to anyone but CNN.,194,66,13,273,646,5659
"Well, he probably thinks you're abominable.",202,50,21,273,646,5796
No pics. He has strict image and licensing control to avoid brand dilution from commercial over-exposure.,203,53,20,276,646,1539
"John, sometimes YOU have to ask for directions.",213,53,22,288,646,3073

He's counting steps.,188,50,18,256,646,1406
It didn't mean anything to me. It was just a winter fling.,185,56,15,256,646,4974
It's the big feet that make his hands look small.,189,48,19,256,646,5753
"The same thing any of us are seeking, I suppose.  Just wanting to be seen, really seen, by someone.",188,55,16,259,646,1541

"I told you not to call him ""abominable"" to his face.",195,51,19,265,646,4290
"We went to Cleveland to meet my parents, its only fair that we go to meet his.",195,51,19,265,646,5474
It’s just “Snowman”. How would you like it if I always referred to you as Abominable Ralph?,201,54,19,274,646,108
He asked us to pay for a wall.,205,46,23,274,646,3881

"For the record, I requested a trip to the Serengeti.",193,47,20,260,646,203

"Honey, we were just talking.",204,55,19,278,646,1043
"Ignore him, he's trying to get his 10,000 steps before dinner",207,49,22,278,646,1829

"He said, and I quote, 'You can't get theah from heah'.",182,46,18,246,646,2353

"Well, it's true what they say about big feet.",202,36,26,264,646,4352
"He says he doesn't have any idea of where the trail is, but rather smugly pointed out that he isn't lost.",186,43,20,249,646,4577
Confirmed...Starbucks ahead one mile!,208,54,20,282,646,5116
