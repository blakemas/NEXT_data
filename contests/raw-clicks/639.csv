Earl of Cowlick. And you are?,131,58,47,236,639,1296
I'm supposed to call my doctor if it lasts more than 4 hours.,139,53,47,239,639,2907
"So, you're in a tower with no doors; I have a beanstalk growing out of my head. We both lied on our profiles. You wanna go out or not?",145,62,45,252,639,2328
We have to move fast.  The king's men are combing the area!,130,48,37,215,639,1920
The last princess I rescued was in a well.,132,42,39,213,639,555
"Ok, fine, we can make the story about you!",143,79,31,253,639,23
I knew one day my prince would comb.,142,51,38,231,639,425
"Ok, fine. Maybe it’s not as thick as I described but your profile wasn’t exactly clear on your living situation either.",153,55,40,248,639,4512
The guy took my cow and said to plant the magic beans -- but I had't eaten all day.,159,48,43,250,639,3693
"Well, then, let yours down and we can tie the knot here.",137,54,33,224,639,4340
I'm the Hair apparent,142,61,31,234,639,157
"It only does this with you, honest.",138,40,35,213,639,548
"The Grimm brothers will be here any minute, so we have to get our story straight.",152,67,31,250,639,3542
You spent all those years growing this out when you could have built a ladder in days?,175,63,40,278,639,3933
"...or, I could come up?",152,47,37,236,639,2527
Thank goodness! The last guy who came by couldn't get it up.,160,52,37,249,639,3908
Now let me see yours.,146,70,26,242,639,4080
Or you could just take the stairs.,165,59,36,260,639,1760
I call it hairway to Heaven.,166,62,35,263,639,1705
I’m your hairy godfather,148,40,36,224,639,4336
I'm pretty sure we're doing this wrong.,166,48,39,253,639,1500
"Jack said if it lasts for more than five hours, I should call my physician.",163,53,36,252,639,2319
Rogaine and Viagra. Why do you ask?,158,45,37,240,639,4294
My ex lived in a well.,128,51,25,204,639,3009
So many fairy tales get it wrong.,138,48,29,215,639,61
If this lasts more than four hours I'll have to see my doctor.,140,42,31,213,639,2750
"This really isn't necessary, there's a staircase in the back",148,61,27,236,639,2981
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, lower your expectations!",166,45,38,249,639,496
I thought it made me look presidential.,148,49,29,226,639,3412
"I've used the new viagra pomade, but we've only got four hours to get you down.",142,53,27,222,639,3152
"It is I, Manbunzel.",165,39,39,243,639,845
Fine. Let’s try it your way.,153,56,29,238,639,4193
And yet I can't grow a beard.,137,50,26,213,639,3812
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, what should I do if this lasts more than four hours?",162,51,33,246,639,4523
I'm not sure you understand the gravity of the situation.,157,52,31,240,639,2091
"Rapunzel, let down your expectations.",153,54,29,236,639,227
"In my mind, this was always Plan B.",136,53,24,213,639,4532
Rapunzel: the  first draft.,142,60,23,225,639,4295
I don't think you appreciate the gravity of the situation.,155,54,29,238,639,2671
It always stiffens up when I'm near you.,176,55,35,266,639,2100
It’s been four hours. Should I seek medical attention?,176,45,38,259,639,4181
Think of it as Plan B.,160,68,25,253,639,3157
Why is everything always a competition with you?,151,65,23,239,639,1173
"No seriously, let down my hair.",167,58,30,255,639,176
"Post haste my princess, I can not keep it up much longer.",136,54,22,212,639,4061
"Well, that took 30 years but my feet are finally on the ground. You can let go now.",157,51,29,237,639,882
This might work better if we switched places.,136,50,23,209,639,2537
It's a Hairway to Heaven,159,43,32,234,639,450
Can you just buzz me in?,144,53,24,221,639,695
"Oh, how the fables have turned.",155,62,24,241,639,748
"Yes, I’m Repunzel’s son.  Why do you ask?",142,45,26,213,639,362
I feel like you're not meeting me halfway.,158,64,24,246,639,3850
"This usually doesn't happen, I'm just really excited to see you.",168,41,35,244,639,2584
Enough teasing. Come down.,157,43,31,231,639,1779
"Sorry, I'm a little excited to see you.",173,57,30,260,639,3176
"Yes, I suppose I could have brought a ladder. What's your point?",158,69,22,249,639,1950
Thanks for letting me down gently.,154,57,25,236,639,4273
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.,161,58,26,245,639,3732
"If you pull me up, I won't let you down.",138,39,26,203,639,208
"What do you mean by ""or am I just glad to see you?""",160,36,33,229,639,3579
I think we need to read the book again.,155,60,23,238,639,3239
"Trust me, the alternative is equally Grimm.",156,41,30,227,639,185
I thought maybe you'd had enough let downs.,154,45,28,227,639,1691
Wait... let's just savor the irony for a minute.,161,45,30,236,639,4163
"Wait, I've got a better idea.",149,52,24,225,639,2630
"Yes, they're extensions.  Quit being a such a princess.",170,57,28,255,639,1077
The dispatcher said you were down a well.,168,58,27,253,639,2775
"Oh, the usual, part it on the left and take 18 feet off the top.",140,58,19,217,639,2142
I'm thinking the ladder might have been a better plan.,146,57,21,224,639,1453
Rapunzel in Australia.,155,38,30,223,639,3484
In hindsight you're right. That's a much better idea.,141,49,22,212,639,1388
"First you pull me up, then I let you down.",151,54,23,228,639,541
The Viagra went to my head.,146,47,24,217,639,704
I think we are doing this all wrong.,163,49,28,240,639,990
I’ll just take the stairs.,153,55,23,231,639,1785
"It’s not you Rapunzel, it’s me.",159,54,25,238,639,2044
I think you're right. I don't think this is how it's supposed to go. Did you read the whole story or just skim it?,152,43,27,222,639,315
I figured you were tired of being let down.,151,42,27,220,639,282
"Okay, here’s where it gets tricky.",151,53,23,227,639,89
Go ahead...the laws of physics havent been discovered yet.,158,50,26,234,639,350
I thought I'd wear it up.,166,56,26,248,639,4108
"I thought this time, maybe you come to my place.",136,52,19,207,639,1137
"Up"" is the New ""Down""",158,44,28,230,639,3786
"Well yeah, I guess your way might work too.",164,54,26,244,639,2526
"Oh, there’s a door in the back?",163,56,25,244,639,3737
"I'm gonna be honest, something about this feels off.",153,51,24,228,639,4218
I don't think you know the gravity of this.,158,53,24,235,639,3032
Take off about two feet and frost the tips.,162,60,23,245,639,966
This kid named Jack fed me magic beans.,165,54,26,245,639,1872
...and so I ate the magic beans.,164,53,26,243,639,3602
We do this a little differently in the southern hemisphere.,156,55,23,234,639,4138
We really didn't think this out.,154,64,19,237,639,920
"Rapunzel, let down my hair!",139,47,21,207,639,3897
The fairy godmother said to call if it doesn't go down after 4 hours.,151,45,25,221,639,3325
"Hurry, before it gets humid.",156,57,22,235,639,4324
I don't think you realize the gravity of the situation!,158,60,21,239,639,1356
Are you Rapunzel? Or am I Rapunzel?,157,51,24,232,639,2529
"Okay, Miss Smartypants, YOU come up with an idea.",156,53,23,232,639,4431
I've got a bad feeling we're doing this all wrong.,152,52,22,226,639,1133
Am I going up or are you coming down?,143,48,21,212,639,3463
I’m starting to see the flaw in this plan,152,60,19,231,639,3353
Donald courts Melania,176,42,32,250,639,2836
"You know, I'd really appreciate it if we revisited the ladder idea again.",145,52,20,217,639,1059
The real prison is gender roles,141,49,20,210,639,2534
If you think that's impressive wait until later tonight!,158,56,22,236,639,1710
"Ok, so I misunderstood....  I'll go get the ladder.",151,56,20,227,639,2613
This is not what I meant when I asked you to reciprocate.,150,47,23,220,639,370
"Hurry up! If this thing stays upright for more than four hours, I'll have to go to Emergency!",153,41,26,220,639,729
What do I do? It's been more than four hours,149,49,22,220,639,3139
"For your information, it's called an updo.",160,62,20,242,639,1253
"That new Viagra shampoo, is wonderful",190,60,28,278,639,2465
"I don't know why, but it always seems to do this when I see an attractive woman",150,39,25,214,639,2817
I forgot which way the story goes.,169,57,24,250,639,3021
Come over? I thought you said “comb-over.”,165,43,28,236,639,2748
"Sorry, this was the best I could do off the top of my head",151,41,25,217,639,3037
It a combination of Viagra and Rogaine!,152,47,23,222,639,3651
Ok-so maybe I didn’t completely think this through.,143,54,18,215,639,2301
It’s a combination of Rogaine and Viagra.,161,53,23,237,639,2985
"Look Rapunzel, it's 2018, things are different now.",173,67,21,261,639,2591
"Careful, they're extensions.",184,53,29,266,639,113
"I don't know. I'm a prince, not a physicist.",149,55,19,223,639,1365
I guess I don't understand the gravity of the situation...,148,46,22,216,639,2780
"Leznupar, Leznupar,   pull up my hair.",154,42,25,221,639,1342
Stairs? I thought you said hairs!,154,50,22,226,639,3015
And then...hold on. I think I have the instructions upside-down.,185,53,29,267,639,677
Yank me up.  It's a new era.,167,48,26,241,639,9
"Leznupar, Leznupar - let up your hair!",168,51,25,244,639,4581
"Gravity won't be explained for another couple hundred years, so just go with it",158,52,22,232,639,1881
"Rapunzel, you don’t understand the gravity of the situation.",160,53,22,235,639,4201
Is that product in your hair or are you just happy to see me?,159,36,28,223,639,3396
How drunk were we the night we made this plan?,173,62,22,257,639,4563
I thought we were going to your place.,149,53,19,221,639,244
Historians will never get our story right.,153,61,17,231,639,4439
My pharmacist accidentally combined my Rogain and Viagra prescriptions.,167,41,28,236,639,1067
It's a wig. I got it at Trump University.,170,37,29,236,639,1224
Or you could come down?,156,52,21,229,639,2776
"In hindsight, I guess a ladder is not a bad idea.",147,51,19,217,639,3740
"Well, I could pull you up, but then where would we be.",174,56,24,254,639,788
I’m not sure we thought this all the way through.,178,56,25,259,639,45
Is that your hair? Or are you just happy to see me?,142,39,22,203,639,4200
We really need to get the elevator fixed.,161,52,22,235,639,367
It's called the Trumpunzel.,171,32,32,235,639,1536
Think of it as an extensions ladder.,149,41,23,213,639,463
Now what?,163,45,25,233,639,266
The ride down might be little hairy,164,43,26,233,639,1929
Didn't you read the story?,178,58,24,260,639,2178
Maybe you could just take the stairs.,164,40,27,231,639,1995
Look; does it really matter who's hair it is?,140,45,19,204,639,2258
I'm not sure I thought this one through.,160,56,20,236,639,1234
It's a combover with superglue. Isn't this Trump Tower?,169,46,26,241,639,3312
"I assure you, I have no problems keeping it up.",151,47,21,219,639,2365
Rogaine merged with Viagra,175,50,26,251,639,83
Are we in the right fairy tale?,174,52,25,251,639,4510
Do you think I could take the stairs this time?,173,70,18,261,639,1322
That's as stiff as if gets.,164,53,22,239,639,2239
"To be perfectly frank, while the hair extension is very nice, I'd rather the money had been spent on a ladder.",150,47,20,217,639,4075
That Rogaine Viagra combo works wonders!,183,55,26,264,639,2755
No mousse. I'm just really happy to see you.,166,46,25,237,639,1000
"Thanks, but I think I'll just use the stairs",150,43,22,215,639,1156
It feels good to let my hair up every once in a while.,169,53,23,245,639,366
"I hate to rush you, but my family has a history of male pattern baldness.",142,48,18,208,639,1477
I was willing to go to any length...,155,62,16,233,639,1294
"Trust me, I can keep it up.",180,44,29,253,639,3473
Wait! I have a better idea.,170,53,23,246,639,3986
I think this relationship is headed in the wrong direction.,172,49,25,246,639,4399
"No, I also have not read the story.",144,54,16,214,639,2745
"You know there’s a door on the other side, right?",156,38,25,219,639,4407
Are you sure you don't want to use the ladder?,158,58,18,234,639,2815
I must have mixed some Viagra in with my Rogaine.,183,48,28,259,639,1545
"Sure, if we do it your way, no one will ever remember my name!",151,39,22,212,639,4537
Just take a bit off the top.,161,41,25,227,639,2014
We should reread the story before going  through with this.,159,61,17,237,639,2964
It's been like this for over 4 hours!  I knew I shouldn't mix Viagra and Rogaine.,164,51,22,237,639,4332
The infomercial said it will stay erect for up to 4 hours.,164,59,19,242,639,3881
"Yes, I am just glad to see you.",193,49,30,272,639,3385
We might need to rethink your escape plan.,171,42,27,240,639,1551
You’re the one who always wants to try something different.,160,48,22,230,639,1702
My therapist said that we should practice some role reversal.,142,52,16,210,639,1861
"Yes, it's a combover - it that a deal breaker?",175,55,23,253,639,1248
"Well, do you have a better idea?",154,65,14,233,639,3143
Can you take a little off the top?,157,35,26,218,639,3770
"Harold, I know extensions when I see them.",152,47,19,218,639,4400
I wasn’t sure which pill was Propecia and which was Viagra—so I took them both.,172,42,27,241,639,2889
I think we're doing this wrong.,160,58,18,236,639,2215
"Rapunzel Rapunzel not upward I go, Rather you slide down -this is different I know.
Slither to me by descending my doo, We'll run off together and share our shampoo...",153,64,14,231,639,1112
"Take your time, they promised 12 hours of maximum hold and lasting shine.",157,42,22,221,639,1680
Did we get this wrong  Punrazel ?,146,46,19,211,639,1122
I accidentally dropped viagra in my shampoo.,193,45,31,269,639,866
"I thought I'd move in with you, instead.",161,45,23,229,639,305
Oh wait! I see what we’re doing wrong!,155,49,20,224,639,2491
"... the last prince with a big comb-over made promises, too!",155,35,25,215,639,2191
"Yes, sorry, it IS a comb-over.",171,48,24,243,639,1435
"Keep holding.  Once it sets, we're out of here.",164,62,17,243,639,4527
Thank you for letting me down gently,158,50,20,228,639,84
No one said role reversal was going to be easy.,159,48,21,228,639,2418
Because I thought you were locked in a dungeon—not a tower.,179,53,24,256,639,4179
"Yes, it's a toupee, so you may want to take the stairs",154,42,22,218,639,2749
Just slide down.,155,37,24,216,639,2046
I was thinking tonight we could go to my place.,165,38,26,229,639,4170
I think it might be easier if YOU came DOWN!,152,56,16,224,639,28
Won't you consider taking the stairs?,152,56,16,224,639,103
Are you sure this is how the story goes?,155,50,19,224,639,119
What do you mean 'What took me so long?',170,57,20,247,639,342
"Manbunzel, Manbunzel, let up your hair!",164,53,20,237,639,2892
I still think my plan was better.,157,51,19,227,639,3313
Maybe I should take the stairs.,157,43,22,222,639,3623
I'm kind of a bigwig.,153,43,21,217,639,732
"What do you mean, ""over-compensating""?",163,52,20,235,639,741
It's called an 'updo'.,177,53,23,253,639,233
I'm thinking we should try this the other way around.,166,59,18,243,639,2857
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down my hair.  I promise I'll call!",164,47,22,233,639,3134
Let's change some details when we write the book about this.,162,43,23,228,639,896
"Someday, Rupunzal, we’ll look back on this and laugh.",158,43,22,223,639,3107
"Rapunzel, just tie it on to the bedpost and think of it as a zip line",140,42,18,200,639,610
"Please, comb down.",160,31,27,218,639,2199
I just had the most hair-raising experience!,163,54,19,236,639,2705
I knew I didn't understand the story.,158,56,17,231,639,1508
I thought maybe it could be my place this time.,155,48,18,221,639,378
"I promise if you pull me up, I'm never gonna let you down.",152,36,23,211,639,3200
The plan is still a good plan...we just need to tweak a few things.,166,58,18,242,639,2010
Did we get it backwards?,170,50,22,242,639,2229
You come down? I thought you wanted me to come up.,160,62,15,237,639,1958
