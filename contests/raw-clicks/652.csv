Looks like a dessert island.,97,31,15,143,652,338
The irony is not lost on me that the dessert island is deserted.,94,37,12,143,652,2442
Here we are on a desert island because you couldn't spell.,100,25,18,143,652,5067

Too bad we weren’t macarooned on that island.,103,28,17,148,652,9051
It's kind of ironic really. I've been misspelling desert for years.,80,25,12,117,652,9947
Let's wait for the roast beef mirage.,106,41,13,160,652,1239

They called it the Big Rock Candy Mountain before climate change.,96,22,17,135,652,1425
No one lives there.  It’s a desserted island.,96,22,17,135,652,2596
Don't spoil your appetite - wait for the main course mirage.,106,29,17,152,652,2776
It was the roof of the world's largest bakery before the sea began rising.,104,33,15,152,652,3956
They're trying to attract an Amazon HQ,105,31,16,152,652,5830
Make sure to wait an hour before you come back.,102,37,13,152,652,7001
It never tastes as good as it looks.,95,32,13,140,652,4314
It seems to me we're nowhere near the Sandwich Islands.,96,30,14,140,652,6509
Go for it if you  want.  I saw the sharks set it up last night.,94,34,12,140,652,8274
"I’m telling you, one cheat day won’t hurt.",98,34,13,145,652,2352
It could be worse. There could be a wall around it.,78,28,10,116,652,5226
It's just as well. I have absolutely no willpower.,99,32,14,145,652,5806

How much do you want to bet that it's just a mirage?,102,27,5,134,652,3556
All we need is the good ship Lollipop.,104,23,7,134,652,5358
It's better than a cleanse.,104,23,7,134,652,5441
The treats are organic but the water is contaminated. I'd say it's a wash.,103,25,6,134,652,5974
Forget it. It's probably a Venus fly island.,104,23,7,134,652,7706

I picked a bad time to give up sugar.,106,26,6,138,652,1509
