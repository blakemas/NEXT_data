I wish you’d come in when it was just a chip on your shoulder.,64,36,41,141,650,4474
The good news? You’re not delusional.,74,36,29,139,650,4112
You were better off with a chip on your shoulder.,74,40,28,142,650,275
"I treat depression and obsession, but not compression.",79,39,30,148,650,3920
Tell me about your first crush.,64,40,19,124,650,2871
I could begin with the obvious--but why don't you go first?,75,44,23,142,650,3670
Last week it was a monkey on your back.,77,45,24,147,650,3463
"So, the last thing you remember was a roadrunner and a coyote?",74,33,25,132,650,3801
And you think this is the cause of your erectile dysfunction?,70,33,22,125,650,3279
"Well, let's start with the obvious.",87,42,25,155,650,3419
"Well, usually when someone tells me that, it's a metaphor.",75,41,21,137,650,5767
This could be the main reason for your erectile dysfunction.,81,31,26,139,650,3317
"I'm just here to give you the tools, you'll have to do the heavy lifting.",84,50,22,156,650,1838
Your time's almost up.  Are you sure there isn't anything else you want to get off your chest?,64,37,17,118,650,6081
No wonder you're unable to have an erection.,90,32,29,151,650,7213
Otherwise OK?,80,31,25,136,650,6296
"On the plus side, you’re using the word ‘literally’ correctly.",71,27,22,120,650,548
What's your gut feeling?,69,34,19,122,650,6493
Let's begin our session with some deep breathing.,78,35,22,136,650,6134
can you feel the pea now?,85,35,25,145,650,1294
You're in luck. My next patient thinks he's Superman.,73,34,20,127,650,7327
The good news is that this problem is not in your head.,78,44,19,141,650,3348
"Now, imagine it's Styrofoam.",86,41,23,150,650,750
I mean besides that.,86,43,22,151,650,413
...and suddenly it hit me.,81,34,23,139,650,6529
"""You know, for the first time in my career I think the problem might not be your mother""",77,40,19,136,650,4640
You might be more comfortable if you take off your shoes.,82,40,21,143,650,4528
"It's $200 for the session, plus $2,000 for the forklift.",89,36,25,150,650,3924
"Thus far, this is the only effective treatment we've found for erections lasting longer than 4-hours.",81,25,25,131,650,4571
I see you've gained weight but it's good that you've got a handle on it.,96,25,31,152,650,7293
Seems to me that you're the underlying issue.,78,44,18,140,650,819
"Ask yourself, does it spark joy?",88,20,29,137,650,251
You ripped off the ankle bracelet - what did you expect?,77,32,21,130,650,1376
The first step is acceptance.,76,37,19,132,650,7112
Why do you think you can't get an erection?,75,29,21,125,650,2854
Can you think of anything concrete that might be causing your anxiety?,93,34,27,155,650,2038
I think I know the cause of your erectile dysfunction.,81,36,21,138,650,917
Any other pressing matters to discuss?,78,45,17,140,650,3952
"If you upgrade to Premium Care, I can get that removed.",81,37,21,140,650,5085
I can't help you if you don't tell me what's wrong.,81,29,23,133,650,5555
"So, what brings you in today?",95,43,24,162,650,4929
You seem obsessed with your weight.,89,25,27,141,650,1464
And how long since your last erection?,80,33,21,134,650,1698
"You can't change the fact that it's there, but you CAN change your reaction to it.",78,50,15,143,650,6620
First I applaud your proper use of “literally”.,78,27,21,126,650,483
Any other symptoms?,77,41,17,135,650,4630
We'll pick this up next week.,79,39,18,137,650,2957
"No, in this instance I agree - it’s not all in your head.",91,45,21,157,650,1462
Take an anvil and call me in the morning.,83,25,24,132,650,4074
I can't help you if you wont tell me what's bothering you.,79,33,20,132,650,6942
Let's pick this up again next week.,88,42,21,152,650,429
"It's a lamp shade, for goodness sake.  Just lift it off you.",91,25,27,143,650,6992
"In my opinion, you're putting too much pressure on yourself.",82,42,18,143,650,7452
You seem depressed.,86,34,22,142,650,398
Depressed in what way?,87,51,17,155,650,1120
But does it spark joy?,69,29,17,115,650,4489
Maybe it’s not all in your mind.,81,37,19,137,650,2475
"I said to take an Advil""",82,25,23,130,650,3222
Sorry about that. It was supposed to hang ominously above you.,76,40,16,132,650,270
Now don't all your other problems seem trivial?,76,38,17,132,650,2120
"So let me get this straight. You clicked ""Accept"" without reading the terms and conditions?",77,22,22,121,650,2718
"Sometimes therapy only works under pressure""",74,43,14,132,650,4284
"I can help you, but it’s you who must do the heavy lifting.",84,43,18,145,650,2933
My first question is how you got in here.,94,45,21,160,650,5282
"I sleep OK, but I have trouble some mornings getting up.",82,43,17,142,650,1534
I've had too many people leave without paying.,85,35,21,142,650,6319
It's just until we verify insurance.,78,40,16,135,650,5408
Hmmm. So roughly how long has it been since you've been unable to achieve an erection?,82,34,20,137,650,4862
"Well we can talk about it, or we can just get a crane.",84,38,19,141,650,4472
Let's start with your weight problem.,88,29,23,140,650,2129
I suggest not starting your day watching the news.,87,40,19,146,650,3253
"Yes, normally it is a metaphor.",92,43,19,154,650,5587
Let's start by getting a belt with a different buckle,85,32,21,139,650,367
Define 'pressing concern'.,76,36,16,128,650,3225
"Would you describe your anxiety as heavy, paralyzing, or crushing?",77,33,17,128,650,6651
I think your delusions are becoming more concrete.,94,46,19,160,650,7510
My mistake; I assumed you were speaking figuratively,94,48,19,162,650,6497
How bad is the pain…on a scale of 1 to 16 tons?,65,37,11,115,650,3617

"Now, try to visualize a crane.",87,36,20,144,650,3608
"We could attempt psychoanalysis, but I'd actually recommend a crane.",80,33,17,131,650,3873
"Yes, but what would you say is your most pressing issue?",76,47,12,135,650,2697
"When you said ""literally"" over the phone I thought you meant figuratively.",84,34,18,137,650,299
Let's leave it there for now.,95,43,19,158,650,6689
“Your hour is up. Can I call you a crane?”,87,34,20,141,650,7227
"I noticed you shaved your head, you want to talk about that?",83,42,16,141,650,7475
My childhood was fine. Please just call 911.,98,43,20,162,650,5492
"Unfortunately we’ve run out of time. 
Let’s pick that up next week.",91,35,21,147,650,2785
"It'd be a coincidence but, yes, it's possible you're having a heart attack.",88,41,18,147,650,3268
Perhaps I wasn't clear. Our time is up.,89,39,19,147,650,7365
"When you said you've been under pressure, had put on a ton of weight and were having trouble getting out of bed in the morning, I suspected something else.",94,35,22,151,650,6336
"Murray, sometimes a two-ton anvil is just a two-ton anvil.",82,28,20,130,650,6777
I've seen bigger,91,44,18,153,650,556
"But no tingling or shortness of breath, right?",79,37,16,132,650,3852
Anything pressing you’d like to discuss?,78,43,14,136,650,3454
"Well, why do YOU think it's there?",88,34,18,140,650,4745
So you say you fell victim to a pyramid scheme?,88,32,21,142,650,4335
Could you be more concrete?,93,27,24,144,650,3290
It can be so hard to get over your first crush.,94,28,24,146,650,7496
"To begin your therapy, I want you to know that your feelings are real.",81,38,16,135,650,1191
"Now, imagine it's a feather ...",83,37,17,137,650,1900
I know it took a lot for you just to come in today.,81,40,15,137,650,2294
That's the worst case of writer's block I've ever seen.,73,23,18,114,650,995
Side effects may include difficulty breathing.,86,40,17,143,650,2821

"Once again Robert, It's not guilt, it's a concrete pylon.",80,24,20,124,650,5627
"If you prefer, we can tell your parole officer you are ready for an ankle bracelet.",79,33,17,130,650,1132
And you're sure you saw a beeping roadrunner right before this?,82,29,19,130,650,3949
"Yes, it probably is more effective than a condom.",84,31,19,134,650,2092
I just provide the tools. YOU have to do the heavy lifting.,79,41,14,134,650,4673
Visualize a crane...,85,39,17,142,650,6852
"Yes Carl, that's the proper usage of 'literally'",92,27,23,142,650,7312
"You say you have a ton of issues, but I see just one.",92,33,21,146,650,7429
"For most of my patients, this is just a metaphor.",94,38,20,152,650,861
"Frankly, I’m surprised to hear about the headaches.",80,23,20,123,650,5410
I think I’ve identified the cause of your erectile dysfunction.,81,33,17,131,650,2923
Really? Does this look like a metaphor to you?,82,32,18,133,650,7152
"First of all, your under too much pressure.",89,39,18,147,650,267
I see you've traded in the albatross.,89,41,17,147,650,5696
It seems to me that your problem is your weight.,80,31,17,128,650,1627
I can't remove it until you've met your deductible,84,29,19,132,650,337
How's the restless leg syndrom now?,81,35,16,132,650,1840
You seem to be in the same place you were when we ended our last session.,86,34,18,138,650,3807
You wanted the other Dr. Crane.,86,37,17,140,650,1077
"When you described your problem over the phone, I assumed you were speaking metaphorically.",87,41,16,144,650,915
Looks like you put on some weight.,93,38,19,150,650,5959
I'm sorry we're out of time. We'll pick it up next week.,93,48,16,158,650,2404
Anything you’d like to get off your chest?,76,29,16,121,650,3761
Have you considered switching to similes?,81,28,18,127,650,587

You never forget your first crush.,91,32,20,143,650,2865
I think it's time that we begin discussing the possibility that it's not your imagination.,89,36,18,143,650,3877
"In the future, metaphors will be just fine""",94,38,19,151,650,3853
"Sorry, dear, but it's what the doctor ordered for an erection lasting more than four hours.",92,26,22,140,650,445
You also mentioned a monkey on your back?,85,37,16,138,650,1525
I think in your case it's not just a feeling.,98,38,20,156,650,2245
"A metaphor would have sufficed, Mr. Richards.",77,35,14,126,650,2309
We're making progress...last week it was the weight of the world.,74,35,13,122,650,2310
When you said you had a weight problem I must say I pictured something different.,84,36,16,136,650,2638
"And what made you yell, ""More cowbell!"" in the first place?",81,21,20,122,650,3082
Why do YOU think you can't get off the couch?,83,32,17,132,650,3398
What do you consider your most pressing problem?,92,38,18,148,650,3556
"Don’t exaggerate, it’s a lamp shade for God’s sake.",91,28,21,140,650,3962
The good news is that you're absolutely not hallucinating.,74,38,12,124,650,5468
"Well, on the up side,  we seem to have got rid of the monkey on your back.",74,32,14,120,650,5998
Did you ever consider a forklift instead of analysis?,89,29,20,138,650,6582
Would you like to get anything off your chest?,86,35,17,138,650,6856
Sometimes a crushing weight on your chest is just a crushing weight on your chest.,93,41,17,151,650,964
You'll feel better once you get it off your chest.,94,30,21,145,650,1987
Well you said you wanted non-pharmaceutical options.,84,45,13,143,650,57
"Well, you didn't like the inkblots at first either.",90,35,18,143,650,6194
Have you given any thought to leaving the Trump Administration?,86,38,16,141,650,794
"So, what brings you here?",88,36,17,141,650,2121
"Can you talk to me about your most pressing 
issues?",92,28,21,141,650,5810
This could explain your ED.,90,23,22,135,650,4310
It doesn't spark joy but it's hard to throw away.,85,30,18,133,650,2052
"You and I both know that the block isn't really the problem, right?",79,40,13,133,650,5114
What was that pressing matter you wanted to discuss?,77,37,13,127,650,4708
I see you spent the weekend with your mother.....,77,31,15,123,650,4336
My diagnosis: obsessive-compressive disorder.,103,35,22,160,650,1388
"Well,  at least we've got a handle on it now.",86,30,18,134,650,5709
...and at what point did you realize it was too much cowbell?,83,30,17,130,650,670
"Doc, is this is the only way to cure an erection lasting longer than four hours?",87,22,21,130,650,4886
Describe this pressure. Are you feeling it now?,83,24,19,126,650,3816
The judge ruled that an electronic bracelet was too risky...,72,40,10,122,650,7018
We'll get to that.,79,26,17,122,650,7434
It makes that chip on your shoulder seem insignificant.,98,44,17,159,650,4811
I think you are regressing. Last visit it was just a can of worms.,92,38,17,147,650,5668
You seem to be getting enough iron.,91,37,16,145,650,1546
I preferred the monkey on my back.,90,34,18,143,650,1318
"If it doesn't bring you joy, just get rid of it.",87,41,14,143,650,6132
Are your hiccups gone?,87,36,16,139,650,4715
I believe the pressure you are feeling is very real.,90,30,19,139,650,5032
Why is it always me who has to get up when the phone rings?,87,33,17,137,650,4905
"Sorry, that was a lot to lay on you all at once.",88,31,18,137,650,6927
So you say you have trouble getting up in the morning...,82,40,13,135,650,4839
"And nice use of the word 'literally,' by the way.",82,37,13,133,650,4773
It was a gift from my mother,87,27,19,133,650,5464
"Sorry, I'm afraid that your insurance has denied the metaphor.",82,34,15,131,650,6990
"To be clear, I was asking what was weighing on your mind",79,37,13,129,650,603
What did you THINK Panini Therapy would be like?,108,32,24,164,650,975
"In the dream, I was Wile E. Coyote...",78,27,16,121,650,5210
Interesting - usually when clients first come to see me they have a lot on their minds.,73,34,12,119,650,7373
I said treat yourself with Advil.,102,24,25,154,650,6351
Please.  I get the symbolism.,88,40,14,142,650,2587
Where would you like to start?,90,35,17,142,650,4742
You seem to be under a lot of pressure,92,28,20,140,650,6063
"OK, Let’s move on to more pressing matters.",90,29,19,138,650,5609
Shall we start with the obvious?,83,40,13,136,650,648
Just let me know when you're comfortable and we can start,84,36,15,136,650,6933
It appears we have tons to discuss.,83,40,13,136,650,7451
"You need a crane operator, not a therapist.",86,30,17,134,650,5778
That’s all the time we have. We’ll pick this up next week.,78,44,10,132,650,2891
Anything else you want to get off your chest?,85,30,17,132,650,3766
"How long, would you say, have you had erectile dysfunction?",84,23,19,126,650,4153
"You understand that treating a metaphor can take a very long time, right?",105,25,25,155,650,5052
...the good news is it’s not a heart attack,74,34,12,120,650,3038
"Your constant need for attention is what we've been working on for months, Alan. And I know it's made out of styrofoam.",96,34,19,149,650,1332
Good news - you asphyxiated that monkey on your back.,93,35,18,147,650,403
What do YOU think the problem is?,90,37,16,143,650,4584
And yet you say there is nothing you want to get off your chest.,90,30,18,139,650,905
"You're right, of course. It's not all in your head.",88,32,17,137,650,5366
Let's start with the obvious -- your socks don't match.,91,26,20,137,650,5431
I’d like to refer you to a colleague of mine. Her name is Dr. Crane.,95,18,24,137,650,7226
What I'm hearing is that you're under a lot of pressure.,99,39,18,156,650,4083
"No, it’s not your imagination.",80,36,13,129,650,2889
It looked a lot smaller on Amazon Prime.,82,30,16,129,650,5702
I charge a flat fee.,82,28,16,127,650,5761
I suppose I'll be charging you a flat fee.,78,34,13,125,650,4042
"In these dreams you’ve been having, are you the roadrunner or the coyote?",74,31,13,119,650,2761
"So, anything in particular you would like to discuss today?",76,29,14,119,650,5311
"Well, it's definitely not all in your head...",72,34,11,117,650,4600
But how does it make you feel?,92,29,19,140,650,577
How's that erection now?,90,33,17,140,650,912
"So, what's holding you back?",99,45,16,161,650,6345
Do you want to tell me what’s troubling you?,86,38,14,138,650,7186
"You're my only patient who uses ""literally"" correctly.",86,35,15,136,650,2872
So...what seems to be the problem today?,71,30,12,113,650,300
Well I can see you're under a lot of pressure.,86,32,16,134,650,2466
"Sure, we could just have it removed, but is that really what you want?",86,29,17,132,650,6039
Can you tell me what brought you in today?,99,32,20,151,650,2690
